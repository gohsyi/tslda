(Reuters) - A U.S. bank regulator announced Thursday that several senior former Wells Fargo executives face potential lifetime industry bans and millions of dollars in civil penalties for their roles in the bank\u2019s long-running sales practices scandal.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced civil charges against five former senior bank executives and settlements of charges with three other senior bank officials, including former Chief Executive John Stumpf. He agreed to pay a $17.5 million penalty and a prohibition from the banking industry, while Carrie Tolstedt, the former community banking head, faces a fine of $25 million and an industry ban.  The regulator said the executives failed to adequately perform their duties and allowed misconduct to continue at the bank for years.","1":"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Monday two directors, including Chairwoman Elizabeth Duke, have resigned, effective from March 8, days before they were set to appear before the U.S. Congress as part of an investigation into bank\u2019s sales practices.  In a statement, the bank named James Quigley as the other board member who stepped down.  The two were set to testify at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Wednesday, where the committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters said she would call for their resignations.  The hearing has not been removed from the committee\u2019s official calendar.  A representative for Waters was not immediately available for comment.  The committee has been investigating the bank and its relationship with regulators after a sales practices scandal that began in 2016, when it was revealed the bank opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. The bank has paid over $7 billion in penalties and fees related to the scandal.  The enquiry unearthed documents and emails that showed a complacent attitude on the part of some directors toward the company\u2019s regulatory issues, according to a report released last week. For example, Quigley complained about having to reschedule his vacation plans to meet with one of the bank\u2019s top regulators.  The report also found that Duke was reluctant to properly oversee one of the bank\u2019s consent orders and suggested that regulators reach out to management instead of to her.  Duke, a former Federal Reserve governor, joined Wells Fargo\u2019s board in 2015. She was elected vice chairwoman in 2016 and became chairwoman in 2018.  Quigley, who joined the board in 2013, and Duke were among the few remaining directors who have been with Wells Fargo since before the scandal came to light. After the resignations, just two of the of the bank\u2019s 10 directors will have been on the board before 2016.  The bank declined to comment on whether the bank was searching for replacements for Duke and Quigley.  However, current board Vice Chairman Charles Noski, former finance chief at Bank of America Corp, will now lead the board. He joined the board in 2019.  The departures take place a month after Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf announced his first major reshuffle since taking over in October, naming several executives to new roles and a JPMorgan Chase & Co veteran to head consumer lending.","2":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s U.S. regulator on Thursday announced it had banned former Chief Executive John Stumpf from the banking industry and charged him and seven other former executives combined more than $58 million in civil penalties for their roles in the bank\u2019s multi-year sales practices scandal.  FILE PHOTO: Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf testifies before a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the firm's sales practices on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 20, 2016. REUTERS\/Gary Cameron\/File Photo  The action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) marks a rare example of senior executives being held personally accountable for failing to put a stop to misconduct at their bank. It also broke new ground for the regulator, which forced Stumpf to pay $17.5 million to settle the charges against him - the largest ever penalty it has secured from an individual.  The OCC\u2019s probe is one of several into the San Francisco-based lender, with investigations by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission ongoing. One person with knowledge of the OCC probe said it was far-reaching and that more individuals could be charged.  \u201cWe do not expect these penalties will end Wells Fargo\u2019s troubles in Washington...Yet this is still a positive development for Wells Fargo as this was a hurdle that the bank was always going to have to clear,\u201d said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group, in a note.  Some of the OCC\u2019s findings, though, contradict Wells Fargo\u2019s 2017 board report into the scandal, which largely pinned the blame on a small number of executives, in particular the bank\u2019s former retail banking head Carrie Tolstedt. But on Thursday, the OCC said many members of the bank\u2019s senior leadership were culpable, a finding that is likely to spark further questions by lawmakers who may push for criminal convictions, said Sieberg.  In addition to Stumpf, former human resources head Hope Hardison and Michael Loughlin, former chief risk officer, settled the OCC\u2019s charges for $2.25 million and $1.25 million, respectively, the OCC said.  Stumpf, who could not immediately be reached for comment, also agreed to a lifetime ban on working for an OCC-regulated bank. He abruptly left the company in October 2016 after a nearly a decade at the helm.  Five other former executives refused to settle, including Tolstedt who is facing a potential $25 million civil monetary penalty, James Strother, the former general counsel, and Claudia Russ Anderson, the former community bank group risk officer, who both face $5 million fines. They and two auditing executives may ultimately fight the charges before a judge under the OCC\u2019s administrative process.  \u201cThroughout her career, Ms. Tolstedt acted with the utmost integrity and concern for doing the right thing. A full and fair examination of the facts will vindicate Carrie,\u201d a lawyer for Tolstedt said in a statement.  In a statement, Strother\u2019s lawyer said the former Wells Fargo executive \u201cacted with the utmost integrity and transparency\u201d and that the OCC\u2019s charges are \u201cfalse and unfounded.\u201d  Russ Anderson could not immediately be reached for comment.  In a memo to Wells Fargo employees, CEO Charlie Scharf said the company was reviewing Thursday\u2019s filings and will determine what, if any, further action is appropriate in respect to any of the individuals who were named. The memo added that the bank would not make any remaining compensation payments that may be owed to those individuals in the meantime.  INDIVIDUAL MISCONDUCT  Wells Fargo, the country\u2019s fourth largest U.S. lender, has paid out more than $4 billion in fines and penalties since the 2016 revelation that the bank\u2019s sales practices encouraged employees to open potentially millions of unauthorized bank accounts in order to hit lofty sales targets.  Since then, internal and external probes have uncovered issues in each of Wells Fargo\u2019s major business lines, including wealth management and the commercial bank. The fallout has also resulted in the Federal Reserve imposing an unprecedented growth restriction on Wells Fargo\u2019s balance sheet until it proves it has fixed its risk management and controls.  While Wells Fargo has inked multiple federal and private settlements for its sales practices, the OCC action marks the first federal action against individuals for their roles in the scandal, instead of just the institution.  In its complaint, the OCC said that senior bank leadership must have been aware of rampant sales misconduct, citing large numbers of employee complaints and years\u2019 worth of other evidence. For example, an internal investigation conducted by the bank in 2004 found that instances in which staff \u201cgamed\u201d the sales system to meet targets climbed 979% from 2000 to 2004.  The number of calls to the bank\u2019s internal ethics hotline steadily climbed from 2006 through 2014, the OCC said, with nearly half of all cases investigated related to sales misconduct.","3":"May 22 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co:  * WELLS FARGO\u2019S STEVE ELLIS TO RETIRE; DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION EXECUTIVE LISA FRAZIER JOINS COMPANY TO LEAD INNOVATION  * WELLS FARGO & CO - ELLIS WILL RETIRE IN SEPTEMBER  * WELLS FARGO & CO - IN SEPTEMBER, LISA FRAZIER WILL BECOME HEAD OF GROUP  * WELLS FARGO & CO - FRAZIER WILL JOIN COMPANY ON MAY 29 AND WILL BE BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO  * WELLS FARGO & CO - STEVE ELLIS, HEAD OF INNOVATION GROUP, WILL RETIRE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","4":"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said on Tuesday that will launch new bank accounts to limit overdraft fees for customers.  One bank account will charge a $5 monthly fee, exclude checks, and limit spending to the amount available within the account. Customers who want to be able to write checks can opt for an account that limits overdraft fees to one per month for a $10 monthly fee.  The new accounts are expected to launch early next year.  Other Wells Fargo deposit accounts give customers the option to avoid a monthly fee so long as their account meets certain requirements like having a direct deposit or making a number of purchases per month.  Overdraft fees have drawn scrutiny from regulators and politicians for years since they are typically only paid by customers with the least money. In 2009 the Federal Reserve issued a rule that prevented banks from charging overdraft fees on ATM and one-time debit card transactions unless the customer opted into overdraft protection. The rule did not apple to recurring payments like subscriptions and auto-pay.  Since the beginning of 2020 Wells Fargo has received dozens of complaints related to overdraft fees, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau database.  Wells Fargo has taken a number of measures to help customers avoid overdraft fees. In 2017 the bank started provided real-time balance alerts to customers whenever their account fall to zero or less, stopped charging fees on accounts that were overdrawn by less than $5, and introduced a overdraft rewind feature that refunded fees charged when a covering direct deposit was received the next day.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  As its consumer bank begins to see signs of recovery from a sales practices scandal that erupted more than two years ago, the San Francisco-based lender has struggled to expand its customer base in the unit catering to businesses and institutional clients. Revenue in the corporate bank dropped 4 percent last year.  Before the scandal, it was rising 6 percent a year on average. Because it offers better margins, the health of the corporate bank is critical to Wells Fargo; it represents about a third of revenue but roughly half of $22 billion in annual profit.  The bank first told investors in September that while it retained most customers throughout its scandals, it was having a harder time recruiting new clients.  This trend has been even more dramatic with the corporate bank where customers tend to stay put. \u201cIt\u2019s been a little bit more challenging for us to bring in new customers,\u201d corporate bank head Perry Pelos told Reuters in a recent interview.  Corporate clients are harder to win in part because commercial banking relations are more complex. Business customers seek cash management services, assistance with importing and exporting transactions, and various forms of credit such as asset-backed loans or revolving lines of credit. These services are usually locked in with multi-year contracts; some clients can only switch providers every five years.  Wells Fargo executives say they are playing the long game, having their teams reach out to prospective clients to build relationships that they hope will pay off down the road.  \u201cI\u2019ve lived through an entire generation of ownership before we won the business,\u201d said Greg O\u2019Brien, the division manager for commercial banking in New England.  REPUTATIONAL PROBLEMS  Last year, executives and analysts identified signs of life in Wells Fargo\u2019s consumer unit for the first time since the 2016 scandal that rocked the bank. Primary checking accounts grew 1.2 percent in 2018, and auto loan originations jumped 9 percent in the most recent quarter.  The corporate bank, however, continues to languish. When business clients consider switching banks, Wells Fargo\u2019s lingering reputational problems make it a harder sell, analysts say. Consumers don\u2019t have to justify their decision to open a new credit card to anyone but themselves, said Autonomos analyst Brian Foran. Decision-makers at companies, such as the treasurer, have to answer to the board and other executives.  \u201cAt the margin some of them are going to say, Wells Fargo is very good but so is JPMorgan,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, no one gets fired for hiring JPMorgan.\u201d  Wells Fargo officials acknowledge the scandals remain a concern with certain customers. \u201cI\u2019ve certainly been in meetings where it comes up,\u201d said O\u2019Brien.  The scandal began with the disclosure the lender had opened unauthorized accounts for consumers. Later Wells Fargo disclosed that corporate bank employees had improperly altered customer information on certain documents. Wells Fargo has racked up billions in fines. Last year the Federal Reserve imposed a punitive asset cap on the bank, preventing it from growing its balance sheet until it improves risk management.  Pelos, the corporate bank chief, has tried to compensate for the declining revenue by slashing costs. But the 3 percent reductions last year weren\u2019t enough to offset the revenue slide. Though 2018 profit increased, the unit became less efficient. A key metric that measures the cost of one dollar of revenue, increased to 56 percent from 55 percent a year earlier.  Wells Fargo has not provided 2019 revenue projections for its corporate bank. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of confidence that they are going to hit their expense targets, but there\u2019s much less confidence that revenue is going to be able to grow as they do that,\u201d Foran, the Autonomous analyst, said.  Revenue declines are bad for any company, but for Wells Fargo it raises questions about whether the kind of growth it reported before its scandals is achievable with tighter oversight, analysts said. In the past, the corporate bank focused on growing its cross-selling metric, which measured how many products employees hawked to clients, according to filings.  The bank still tracks referrals across different parts of the business today, but the company no longer reports them publicly.  O\u2019Brien, the northeast middle bank head, said the cross-selling system, which led to the creation of the fake accounts in the consumer bank, didn\u2019t cause similar problems in the corporate bank.  \u201cWe have never been in the business of creating false needs to sell,\u201d he said.  Corporate bank revenue has also been hurt by the Fed asset cap. The unit no longer carries deposits for central banks, and it has sold off some smaller businesses. In January, Wells Fargo pushed back the timeline for when it expects to get the asset cap lifted by six months.  Executives told Reuters they are being \u201cpleasantly persistent\u201d with prospective corporate clients by pitching them ideas and connecting them with existing clients. So far their efforts have failed to bear much fruit, but executives say they have seen signs that customer acquisition trends are beginning to shift.  As evidence that business was looking up, Wells Fargo pointed to recent transactions it helped advise like Berry Global\u2019s $4.39 billion takeover bid for RPC Group Plc, .  Earlier this month, Wells Fargo also advised its first ever USD global benchmark for the World Bank.  \u201cMy expectation is that it\u2019s going to be better,\u201d Pelos said. \u201cIs it going to be back to where it was before? It\u2019s hard to call.\u201d  (The story fixes misspelling of Autonomous research firm on second reference)","6":"June 25 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc said on Thursday that it has hired Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s Titi Cole to run global operations and fraud prevention for its consumer bank.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The Fed\u2019s policy shift could make it tougher for Wells Fargo to shake off the unprecedented sanctions that the bank said on Thursday are expected to crimp earnings by around $100 million.  In February, the Fed ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion until it had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practices scandals. The regulator previously said Fed staff would assess the adequacy of the bank\u2019s remediation plan, which would also be reviewed by an independent third party.  During a congressional hearing in March and in a follow-up letter, however, Senator Warren pressed Fed Chair Jerome Powell to submit the bank\u2019s remediation plan to a board vote and to consider publishing the third-party review.  On May 10th, Powell wrote to Warren that he accepted the request for a board vote.  \u201cAfter further consideration, the decision about terminating the asset growth restriction will be made by a vote of the Board of Governors,\u201d Powell wrote in the letter published by Warren\u2019s office on Friday.  He added that when the third-party review is ready, \u201cwe will review that report to determine whether and to what extent the report can be publicly disclosed.\u201d  The Fed declined to comment on Friday beyond Powell\u2019s letter. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo declined to comment on the Fed\u2019s decision.  On Thursday, Wells Fargo told investors the cap would hurt earnings less than it thought this year.  The bank previously expected the asset cap to hit after-tax net income by up to $400 million, but lower deposit and loan growth gave it room under the limit and caused it to cut that figure to less than $100 million, Treasurer Neal Blinde said.  The bank said in financial filings that it had received detailed feedback from the Fed regarding its remediation plan. In order to have enough time to incorporate this feedback, Chief Executive Tim Sloan said the bank was planning to operate under the cap for the first part of 2019.  \u201cI\u2019m glad the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors changed course,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \u201cThe Fed must strictly enforce its order to show Wells Fargo that it means business.\u201d","9":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. bank regulator announced Monday it had fined three former executives at Wells Fargo Bank WFC.N for their roles in the company's sales practices scandal.

The OCC imposed a $925,000 fine on Matthew Raphaelson, the former community bank group finance officer, and barred him from the banking industry. It also imposed a $400,000 fine on Kenneth Zimmerman, the bank\u2019s former head of community bank deposit products group, and a $350,000 fine on Tracy Kidd, the former head of community bank human resources.  The fines come nine months after the regulator imposed fines on eight other former bank executives, including former CEO John Stumpf.  In a statement, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman acknowledged the bank\u2019s community bank had a \u201cflawed\u201d model, but that the firm was committed to fundamental changes.  \u201cAt the time of the sales practices issues, the company did not have in place the appropriate people, structure, processes, controls or culture to prevent the inappropriate conduct,\u201d said spokeswoman Jennifer Langan. \u201cThe company is different today, and we are doing what\u2019s necessary to regain the trust of all stakeholders.\u201d  The regulator added that the settlements also require the individuals to cooperate with any other investigation related to the sales practices.","10":"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N has hired Michael Cleary from Santander Holdings USA Inc to lead sales practices oversight and management, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

Reuters reported on Tuesday that Scharf had exasperated some Black employees in a Zoom meeting this summer when he reiterated that the bank had trouble reaching diversity goals because there were not enough qualified minority candidates.  He also made the assertion in a company-wide memo that announced diversity initiatives as nationwide protests broke out following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American man, in police custody.  \u201cThere are many talented diverse individuals working at Wells Fargo and throughout the financial services industry and I never meant to imply otherwise,\u201d Scharf said in a statement on Wednesday.  \u201cAcross the industry, we have not done enough to improve diversity, especially at senior leadership levels.\u201d  The remarks on a shortage of candidates were widely criticized by politicians and business leaders after the Reuters report was published on Tuesday.  Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the most prominent Wells Fargo critics, said the bank\u2019s problem begin with its leadership.  \u201cIts CEO has an unfathomable blind spot about how and why this giant bank fails to hire, promote, and fairly compensate Black talent \u2013 and continues to be a core part of a financial system that scams Black families disproportionately and fuels structural racism in our economy and our society,\u201d she said in a statement.  \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s the CEO of Wells Fargo who lacks the talent to recruit Black workers,\u201d U.S. Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a tweet.  Scharf listed a handful of appointments the bank has made recently as evidence of its commitment to diversity and went on to lay out details of the steps it was taking to recruit more from minorities.  As the head of the largest U.S. bank by number of employees, he has pledged to double the number of Black leaders over five years and tied executive compensation to reaching diversity goals.  He has also told hiring managers to consider diverse candidates for high-paying roles that are vacant and to ensure diversity on interview teams.  \"Anyone who's open to re-evaluating their position, their perspective and taking into consideration a new set of facts, you have to give him the benefit of the doubt,\" said Teri McClure, a former executive with United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N who had been among those criticizing Scharf on Tuesday.  \u201cThe Wells Fargo team should use that as an opportunity to move forward,\u201d she added.  Since Scharf joined the bank a little less than a year ago, it has added two Black executives to its operating committee - Lester Owens as head of operations and Ather Williams as head of strategy, digital and innovation.  \u201cThere is no question Wells Fargo has to make meaningful progress to increase diverse representation,\u201d Scharf said on Wednesday.","13":"(Reuters) - Democratic Representative Katie Porter, a first-term lawmaker known as a tough Wall Street critic, accused Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N of passing on costs associated with its wide-ranging scandals to third parties, in a scathing letter sent to the bank's new chief executive on Thursday.  FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo stagecoach is seen at the SIBOS banking and financial conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada October 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Chris Helgren\/File Photo  A copy of the letter was viewed by Reuters.  Last summer, Wells Fargo asked 14 of its IT vendors to return 2.5% of revenue earned in 2018, claiming that the vendors benefited from increased business as a result of its sales-practices scandals. Reuters reported in November that several of the vendors had paid Wells Fargo, and some felt pressured to do so out of fear of lost future business.  \u201cThese small businesses played no role in the misdeeds committed by the Bank,\u201d Porter, who serves on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, said in the letter to Wells Fargo Chief Executive Charlie Scharf.  Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Wells Fargo representatives have said participation in the voluntary rebate would not be considered when awarding future contracts.  Asking for a rebate and linking it to higher costs due to regulatory backlash goes against the intent of regulator actions, Porter said.  \u201cWhen federal watchdogs ... assess fines against bad actors, a major purpose of those fines is to discourage continued bad behavior,\u201d she said in the letter. \u201cWhen those bad actors then pass the cost of those fines down to their vendors ... the purpose of the fine is subverted.\u201d  Porter requested that Wells Fargo refund the rebates by Jan. 30.  The letter is the second Porter has sent to Scharf since he took over in October and the latest sign that the company\u2019s woes in Washington are unlikely to abate any time soon. Last month, Representative Maxine Waters, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, said she would ask Wells Fargo board members to testify this year.  Wells Fargo has been under intense scrutiny since 2016 revelations that employees opened up potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. The scandal sparked multiple probes that uncovered issues in each of its main business lines and resulted in over $4 billion in fines and penalties.  The San Francisco-based bank has leaned on cost cuts in recent years as the fallout from the scandal stunted revenue growth. However, increased spending on headcount and technology to satisfy regulators has caused the bank to back away from its expense targets.","14":"June 7 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co will pay at least $386 million to settle class-action claims by customers who said the bank signed them up for auto insurance they did not want or need when they took out car loans.

FILE PHOTO: The sun rises behind a Wells Fargo building in El Paso, Texas, U.S., March 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Parker, 64, was thrust into the position in March when former CEO Tim Sloan resigned abruptly, saying pressure from politicians and regulators had become a distraction in running the scandal-plagued bank.  Critics like U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, had argued Sloan\u2019s 30-year tenure made him incapable of changing an internal culture that fueled a string of customer abuses.  Sloan was the second Wells Fargo CEO to depart following revelations in 2016 that employees had opened potentially millions of fake customers accounts. The fourth-largest U.S. bank has paid billions of dollars in fines and is still being investigated by various federal agencies.  The board had set a goal of hiring an outsider, with Chair Betsy Duke saying the position should attract the top talent in banking. Reuters reported in April the bank had hired search firm Spencer Stuart and was focused on finding female candidates.  But the external search has been complicated by concerns Wells Fargo could not pay the big dollars necessary to lure talent from competing banks. The board\u2019s pick would also be subject to an unusual vetting by U.S. regulators.  Board members started warming up to the idea of keeping Parker after he made a good impression on stakeholders including regulators, investors and employees.  \u201cHe\u2019s obviously exceeded expectations and that\u2019s a credit to him,\u201d said Steven Potter, CEO of executive recruiting firm Odgers Berndtson U.S.  Sources familiar with the board\u2019s thinking said Parker has not been tainted by the scandal since he joined in 2017, the year after customer abuses first emerged. One of the sources said Parker\u2019s two years at the bank have given him enough understanding of lingering problems to fix them quickly.  It could take months for the search committee to come to a final decision about who is the best person to lead the San Francisco-based bank. Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting would then need to privately review and sign off on that pick.  A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo declined to comment. Representatives from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the bank\u2019s primary regulators, declined to comment.  Parker joined Wells Fargo as general counsel from law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where he was partner in charge of managing the firms operations.  Through his work at the firm defending high-profile clients like former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, he also developed relationships in Washington that will be helpful while navigating Wells Fargo\u2019s regulatory problems.  At Wells Fargo, he has been focused on cleaning up existing issues and preventing them from spreading.  Parker spent his first two months as interim CEO meeting with regulators in Washington, employees in Charlotte, North Carolina, and investors in New York City.  He has said his priorities as interim CEO are to improve customer service, satisfy regulatory requirements and continue making operations more efficient.  At an investor conference last week, Parker said the bank had entered a new stage of understanding with regulators and that, based on his meetings, the relationships were more constructive than before.  \u201cWe are probably a little bit more attentive now to everything they\u2019re saying,\u201d he told investors. \u201cAnd frankly, in some cases, they\u2019ve been speaking with greater clarity.\u201d  Still, with Parker at the helm the bank could face even more pressure from lawmakers who wanted to see an outsider, industry analysts said. Turning inside to find a successor could also make some investors feel the board was unable to find a desirable candidate interested in the job.  Since Parker became CEO, Wells Fargo created a new unit charged with working through the 14 regulatory consent orders the bank is operating under and expanded its board to include a director who has experience managing a bank.","16":"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N is nearing a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department (DOJ) over previously disclosed probes into its sales practices, the New York Times reported on Thursday.

The layoffs are consistent with the bank\u2019s previously announced plans to reduce headcount by up to 10 percent by 2020, spokesman Tom Goyda said. Wells Fargo, the No. 4 U.S. bank by assets, had about 262,000 employees as of Sept. 30.

About 900 of the layoffs are in the bank\u2019s home lending unit, reflecting declines in application volume and the number of customers in default. The cuts will be spread across the United States but are concentrated in Des Moines, Iowa, which is expected to have about 400 reductions, and Fort Mill, South Carolina, which is expected to have 111 cuts.  \u201cWe are committed to retaining as many team members as possible and will do everything we can to help them identify other opportunities within Wells Fargo,\u201d Goyda said.

Scharf has tried to place the scandal squarely in the past, describing \u201chistorical\u201d and \u201clegacy\u201d issues, but lawmakers will rehash Wells Fargo\u2019s mistakes in public.  Consent orders: Wells Fargo is currently operating under roughly 14 consent orders with various regulators including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the orders, the bank will endure intense regulatory scrutiny until it proves it has fixed procedures that allowed employees to create potentially millions of unauthorized accounts, and sell auto insurance and other add-on products that customers did not want or need. The orders also require Wells Fargo to repay customers for costs associated with its consumer abuses. So far the bank has paid out at least tens of millions of dollars in remediation.  Asset cap: The most notable consent order looming over the bank is the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s asset cap, which put an unprecedented growth restriction on the bank\u2019s balance sheet until it proves that it has overhauled its risk management and controls. Since the asset cap was announced in early 2018, bank executives repeatedly extended the timeline for getting it removed and have since stopped giving any guidance on the issue. On his first public conference call last month, Scharf did not set a new timeline.  Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating: Even if Wells Fargo\u2019s asset cap is lifted, its growth could still be hampered by its CRA rating, which assesses how well banks service poorer communities. In 2017, federal regulators downgraded Wells Fargo two notches to \u201cNeeds to Improve\u201d from \u201cOutstanding\u201d shortly after the scandal broke. The rating, which is typically only reviewed every five years, curtails the bank\u2019s ability to make acquisitions and open branches, and requires Wells Fargo to seek regulatory approval in financing decisions like issuing or prepaying debt. A less than satisfactory rating also prevents the bank from courting certain government business.","22":"A $142 million settlement reached by Wells Fargo in a nationwide class action over its opening of unauthorized accounts does not adequately compensate individuals whose credit scores were hurt by the bank\u2019s actions, three objectors to the deal told a federal court.

The San Francisco-based bank named Brandee McHale to be the new head of the Wells Fargo Foundation which will be focused on addressing housing affordability, improving financial literacy and growing small businesses. McHale joins the bank from Citigroup Inc and replaces Jon Campbell whose retirement was previously announced.  Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, has ramped up its charitable giving following a profit boost from tax reform and in the wake of a wide-ranging sales scandal which has badly tarnished its reputation and weighed down its financial performance.  Wells Fargo gave away $444 million to charitable causes last year, potentially positioning it as the top corporate cash giver in the country. The bank has pledged to donate 2% of its after-tax profit annually.  As part of its renewed focus on promoting home-ownership, Wells Fargo said it will donate $1 billion to organizations that support affordable housing through 2025 and launch a $20 million grant to encourage organizations to find new solutions for the lack of lack of low-to-moderate income housing options.  Wells Fargo has already donated over $460 million in down-payment assistance grants since 2012.  By focusing on housing, financial literacy and small businesses the bank will be donating more money toward causes that align closely with its business expertise, spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn said.  Wells Fargo will still support causes like arts, education and disaster relief through local projects but broader initiatives will be focused on the three primary areas.","25":"Feb 13 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan on Tuesday reiterated that the bank was stable after the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed several regulatory restrictions, and said there was no change to his cost-cutting measures.

Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said in a brief interview she wanted to press the board on their role in righting the bank after years of fines, regulatory penalties, and business upheaval.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to get some of their board members up here, and see what kind of responsibilities their board members are taking for the management of Wells Fargo,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have hearings, absolutely.\u201d  Waters, a Democrat from California, added that she remains convinced that Wells is too big to be properly managed and should be broken up.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to focus especially on Wells Fargo,\u201d she said of her panel\u2019s agenda next year. \u201cThere\u2019s a new CEO there, but I think the culture of Wells Fargo has developed in such a way that it\u2019s going to be very difficult for this new CEO to get his arms around it.\u201d  The San Francisco-based bank is on its third chief executive since disclosing a wide-ranging sales practice scandal in 2016. Charles Scharf, the former CEO of Bank of New York Mellon, took the lead role at the bank in October.  Scharf sits on the bank\u2019s board, which is currently chaired by Elizabeth Duke, who once served on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors.  The bank declined to comment.  The San Francisco-based bank is currently operating under more than a dozen regulatory consent orders, including an unprecedented growth restriction on its balance sheet from the Fed until the bank proves it has fixed its risk controls. Additionally, Wells Fargo faces federal probes by the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commision and the Department of Labor.  As part of its latest overhaul, the bank also hired a new head of public affairs, William Daley, who worked with Scharf at BNY Mellon and previously served as chief of staff to President Barack Obama.  Separately in 2020, Waters also said she plans to pursue legislation that would set a national interest rate cap of 36% on consumer loans, continue to scrutinize Facebook\u2019s attempts to establish a new digital currency, Libra, and redouble efforts to address homelessness in America.

Wells Fargo's CEO Tim Sloan is sworn in before testifying in a House Financial Services Committee hearing titled: \"Holding Megabanks Accountable: An Examination of Wells Fargo's Pattern of Consumer Abuses\" in Washington, U.S. March 12, 2019. REUTERS\/Erin Scott  While Sloan struggled to convince skeptical lawmakers that Wells Fargo has transformed its culture, he managed to navigate a hostile committee without a major stumble that would have compounded doubts about his leadership.  One of the harshest blows was dealt after the hearing by a key regulator, which said in a statement it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d Wells Fargo had not made more progress fixing its corporate governance and risk management.  Sloan was the first bank executive to be grilled by the House Financial Services Committee since it was taken over by Democrats following the 2018 congressional election. A nervous Wall Street has been keen to see how the panel will treat the industry.  The CEOs of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp are expected to appear before the panel next month.  The committee, led by bank critic Maxine Waters, has several freshmen Democrats who took swipes at Sloan including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a leading voice of her party\u2019s progressive wing, and Ayanna Pressley, who likewise bashed corporate America during her campaign.  But those queries on Wells Fargo\u2019s financing of private prisons and oil pipelines, businesses the bank has previously said it would pull back from, failed to land a major blow.  Democrats and Republicans took a broadly tough line, quizzing Sloan on the bank\u2019s remediation efforts, personnel changes, risk management, culture and whether it should be broken up.  Opening the packed hearing, Waters recounted Wells Fargo\u2019s missteps, saying the bank had failed to prove it had abandoned harmful policies.  \u201cWells Fargo\u2019s ongoing lawlessness and the failure to right the ship, suggests the bank \u2026 is simply too big to manage,\u201d she added, saying later in the hearing that Sloan should step down.  The committee\u2019s ranking Republican Patrick McHenry made it clear that his party would not go soft on the country\u2019s fourth-largest bank.  \u201cYou will hear bipartisan criticism of the actions you have taken and the failures that you have overseen under your watch,\u201d he said.  Still, some Republicans later in the hearing acknowledged the bank\u2019s efforts to change, with Representative Sean Duffy saying his colleagues had been too harsh on Sloan.  BETTER BANK?  The stakes had been high heading into the hearing for Sloan, a 31-year Wells Fargo veteran who was appointed CEO when John Stumpf retired soon after the sales practices scandal erupted in 2016.  The CEO has faced calls to step down from investors and politicians, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 Democratic presidential contender.  Sloan\u2019s prepared remarks emphasized changes the bank has made to culture, sales practices and risk management, as well as efforts to repay wronged customers.  \u201cWells Fargo is a better bank than it was three years ago, and we are working every day to become even better,\u201d Sloan, 58, read from his written testimony.  At times Sloan expressed remorse over the bank\u2019s scandals, noting he felt \u201cterrible\u201d that some servicemen and women had been harmed.  Sloan remained calm under pressure and rebuffed Waters\u2019 claims that Wells Fargo should be broken up. He also said the bank had paid back all customers hit by improper mortgage rate-lock fees and gave a similar answer about auto insurance remediation.  But the CEO struggled to make the case that Wells Fargo is now a good corporate citizen amid repeated interruptions and aggressive, sometimes hectoring questioning from representatives including Democrats Brad Sherman and Stephen Lynch.  Sloan also appeared to frustrate some lawmakers by declining to disclose confidential information on the progress of some remediation efforts, and by failing to say categorically that Wells Fargo would never suffer another scandal.  If lawmakers are unhappy with what they heard, they could pressure the Federal Reserve to maintain restrictions imposed on the bank\u2019s growth until governance and risk management improve.  Waters in her testimony said the Fed\u2019s punishment had not changed the bank, adding that \u201cregulators seem unwilling to take forceful actions.\u201d  After the hearing, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which last year fined Wells Fargo $1 billion for faulty mortgage and insurance products, echoed comments made by its head in October that the bank still had much work to do to.  \u201cWe continue to be disappointed with Wells Fargo Bank N.A.\u2019s performance ... and its inability to execute effective corporate governance and a successful risk management program,\u201d said OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard.  The 2016 revelation that Wells Fargo created millions of fake customer accounts prompted regulatory probes into mortgage foreclosures, auto insurance sales and its wealth management businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines.","29":"Wells Fargo Bank branch is seen in New York City, U.S., March 17, 2020.

Banks were largely expected to take large blows to their earnings as they braced for consumers and companies being unable to pay their bills in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak which has shuttered businesses and put nearly 10 million people out of work.  But Wells Fargo is unique in contending with an unprecedented growth restriction on its balance sheet, which has limited its ability to make loans to corporate clients and customers looking for funds to help them through the crisis.  In 2018, the U.S. Federal Reserve restricted the bank\u2019s balance sheet to $1.95 trillion until it can prove it has the risk management structures which led to the 2016 sales practices scandal. At the end of the quarter, the bank\u2019s total assets were $1.98 trillion, above the level allowed by the Federal Reserve\u2019s consent order, but the bank is managing its average asset level so that it remains in compliance.  \u201cDuring these challenging times, we expect loan-to-deposit growth could continue but cannot provide guidance on the level of growth, and we\u2019re actively working to create balance sheet capacity to help our customers,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry.  The U.S. government has poured trillions of dollars into financial markets and launched stimulus programs to support the economy stalled by the lockdowns put in place to contain the pandemic, but unpaid bills are already piling up.  On a call with analysts, Chief Executive Charlie Scarf called the government actions \u201cswift\u201d and \u201cimpressive,\u201d but added that the length of the shutdown will ultimately determine the severity of the economic blow.  Wells Fargo has already deferred roughly $2.8 billion of payments and $30 million worth of fee waivers, Scharf said.  The San Francisco-based bank set aside some $3.83 billion in credit loss provisions, up from $845 million a year earlier.

REUTERS\/Jeenah Moon\/File Photo  The bank also suspended its guidance for lending revenue for the year, and put its cost cutting initiatives on pause in light of the crisis, executives said.  Total loans rose 2% to $965 billion as an uptick in corporate loans outweighed a drop in consumer credit card balances and some mortgage loans being refinanced away.  Deposits rose 6% across both the consumer and commercial businesses.  Excluding the impact of the loan provisions, revenue from lending activities fell 8% to 11.3 billion. Fee income tumbled 31% to $6.4 billion due to lower mortgage, and card fees.  Overall earnings plummeted to $42 million, or 1 penny per share, from $5.51 billion, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier.

Goyda said the bank had contacted a substantial majority of the affected customers to provide remediation as well as the option to pursue no-cost mediation with an independent mediator.  The revelations are an additional headache for the San Francisco-based bank which is facing numerous regulatory penalties and private lawsuits, most of which stem from a sales practices scandal that touched on all of the bank\u2019s major business units.

Since 2016, Wells Fargo has reviewed 165 million accounts, contacted more than 40 million customers and payed out millions in compensation stemming from sales practices issues, Sloan said in an opening statement to the House Financial Services Committee that was posted on the bank\u2019s website on Monday.  The remarks detailed other steps the bank has taken to improve its culture and interactions with customers in order to move past a series of sales practices scandals.  But Sloan will likely face tough questions on Tuesday from House Democrats like U.S. Representatives Maxine Waters and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are seeking to ramp up oversight of big banks.  Wells Fargo\u2019s remediation efforts have also faced scrutiny from U.S. regulators who say the plans were not thorough enough.  The bank has improved risk management controls by centralizing oversight and restructuring its board in order to prevent new problems from developing, the remarks said.  Last year, the Federal Reserve imposed a consent order on the bank, preventing it from growing its balance sheet until it proves it has improved its risk management controls.  Sloan said the bank has thousands of employees working to satisfy the Fed\u2019s requirements and that Wells Fargo executives and board members have been meeting regularly with U.S. banking regulators to address their concerns and seek input.  Earlier this year the bank said it expects to operate under the asset cap until the end of 2019, pushing back prior guidance by six months.","42":"March 1 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co officials have reached a $240 million settlement of litigation accusing them of poor oversight, resulting in the creation of millions of unauthorized customer accounts.

The credit products will include education loans, personal lines and loans, and credit cards among others, the U.S. lender said in a statement.  The DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, which was introduced in 2012, has shielded from deportation a group of immigrants dubbed \u201cDreamers\u201d and has given them work permits, though not a path to citizenship.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo ATM machine is shown in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The Federal Reserve has signaled it is unlikely to raise interest rates in 2019 given risks to the U.S. economy from a global slowdown, which investors have feared could pressure net interest income, or the difference between what a bank earns on loans and pays on deposits.  The lowered outlook comes at a time of uncertainty for the fourth-largest U.S. lender following the abrupt departure of former Chief Executive Tim Sloan last month.  The bank has been working to keep a tight grip on costs as it continues to battle the fallout from a wide-ranging sales practices scandal that first erupted in 2016, efforts that helped profit rise in the first quarter even as revenue slipped.  Interim CEO Allen Parker said on Friday he was working on improving relations with regulators and making the bank more efficient but acknowledged \u201cwe have more work ahead of us.\u201d  On a call to discuss the results, analysts repeatedly asked why the bank was lowering its net interest income outlook while peers remained more optimistic, and for details on how non-interest-related revenues from fees would shape up.  \u201cIf the revenue base keeps splitting down, I\u2019m afraid that some of your loyal shareholders are going to start to exit before you have a new leadership in place,\u201d Bank of America analyst Erika Najarian said.  Parker said Wells Fargo\u2019s board is pressing forward with the CEO search, but has \u201ccomplete confidence\u201d with current leadership. He did not give a timetable for when a new CEO might be announced.  Finance chief John Shrewsberry reaffirmed that the lender was on track to hit its 2019 cost target. But the longer-term outlook is less certain, since the bank suspended its expense targets for 2020 after Sloan\u2019s exit.  Parker also did not give updated guidance for when a punitive asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve would be lifted, saying he felt it was not appropriate to do so.  Former CEO Sloan had twice pushed back when he expected to get the cap removed, which the Fed says will happen when risk management and internal controls improve.  Wells Fargo expects net interest income to fall 2 percent to 5 percent this year from 2018. It previously forecast between a 2 percent rise and a 2 percent fall.  In the first quarter, net interest income fell 1 percent from a year earlier and 3 percent from the prior period. The bank blamed the decline from the previous quarter on a flattening yield curve, even though JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Friday that higher rates had helped boost its net interest income.  Wells Fargo also appeared more cautious on the economy than other banks reporting on Friday. Its provision expense rose to $845 million from $654 million a year earlier, and the bank flagged the potential for less favorable economic conditions.  On a call with reporters Shrewsberry pointed to economic indicators forecasting higher unemployment rates as a cause for concern and also said the bank expects deposit costs to continue to creep up.  \u201cBetween bigger banks there seems to be some disagreement about where we are in the cycle,\u201d he said.  Wells Fargo shares erased earlier gains during the conference call with analysts and were last down 2.7 percent.  COST CONTROLS  Wells Fargo's net income applicable to common stock rose reut.rs\/2P8a214 to $5.51 billion, or $1.20 per share, from $4.73 billion, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier.  But on an adjusted basis, the bank earned $1.03 per share, short of analyst expectations for an adjusted profit of $1.09 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The bank\u2019s non-interest expenses fell 7.5 percent to $13.9 billion in the quarter from a year earlier. The company is targeting expenses for 2019 of $52 billion to $53 billion.  The decline in expenses outpaced a 1.5 percent fall in total revenue. As signs of a slowing U.S. economy mount, analysts have focused on efficiency in anticipation of slower revenue and loan growth.  The lender\u2019s efficiency ratio, a closely watched measure of cost per dollar of revenue, improved from a year earlier but was higher than in the fourth quarter.  Average loans rose slightly from the prior quarter but were still below last year. Average deposits were down 1 percent from the previous quarter and fell 3 percent from a year earlier.","59":"March 28 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Thursday Chief Executive Officer Timothy Sloan will retire and named General Counsel Allen Parker as its interim head.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo bank sign is pictured in downtown Los Angeles, California, U.S. August 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  This raises the sensitive issue of how much of a voice the fourth-largest U.S. bank is prepared to give to its roughly 265,000 workers, some of whom were excessively pressured by managers to sell products to customers, and whose support the bank may need to repair relations with U.S. regulators.  Wells Fargo has not definitively answered the requests from the union-backed Committee for Better Banks for a worker representative to be added to Wells Fargo\u2019s recently formed Stakeholder Advisory Council. The committee, which also includes consumer and community advocates, first made the request privately to management last June and repeated it in a May 29 letter seen by Reuters.  The May letter, sent to Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan, called for another meeting with management and the committee says it has so far gone unanswered.  At Wells Fargo\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in April, Sloan said the idea of adding a worker to the council was \u201ca fair one\u201d but also highlighted other efforts to connect with employees.  The council\u2019s current members include consumer and community groups such as the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which earlier this year persuaded Wells Fargo to undertake a review of its governance and risk management lapses.  Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said the stakeholder council reviews employee feedback and noted other worker-outreach initiatives such as internal message boards. He declined to comment on whether the bank was working on adding an employee to the council.  Cornelius Hurley, a Boston University law professor, said it makes sense for a stakeholder council to have a workers' representative but bank leaders might be shy of union ties at the CBB. The group is backed by community, consumer and labor groups including the Communications Workers of America and has called for changes at other banks including the U.S. operations of Spain's Banco Santander SAN.MC.  \u201cBankers go apoplectic when you talk about organized labor,\u201d he said.  Erin Mahoney, an organizer for the CBB and the Communications Workers of America labor union, said the lack of a worker on the council stands out considering the other reforms put in place by bank leaders over the past year, under pressure from regulators.  \u201cI\u2019d have to agree that so far it has been a missed opportunity,\u201d she said.  The bank named its stakeholder council in late 2017 to advise on a range of topics as it works to improve oversight and governance to show that it has rooted out any customer abuses.  Its scandals erupted in 2016 after employee whistleblowers helped reveal customer abuses involving workers opening potentially millions of unauthorized accounts to hit sales targets. That led to hefty fines and a cap on assets until the bank proves to U.S. regulators its governance has improved.  The stakeholder council meets with Wells Fargo\u2019s management and board, which is chaired by Elizabeth Duke, a former Federal Reserve governor who once headed the U.S. central bank\u2019s consumer and community affairs committee.  NEXT STEPS  The bank has already taken other steps aimed at rebuilding the trust of employees and, in turn, investors, including eliminating product sales goals for retail workers, granting stock and raising wages.  Sloan said last fall the bank had hired back nearly 2,000 workers who quit or were fired.  At the same time Wells Fargo is under investor pressure to improve expenses per dollar of revenue. One of the CBB\u2019s requests is for all Wells Fargo employees to be paid at least $20 an hour, up from a base wage of $15 an hour.  No Wells Fargo employees are labor union members. Just 46,000, or 1.1 percent, of U.S. finance workers were union members, Labor Department statistics for 2017 show, the lowest percentage of any U.S. industry workforce.  Alex Ross, a Wells Fargo bankruptcy specialist in the Minneapolis area and a CBB member, said several dozen colleagues got in touch after he raised the group\u2019s issues with Sloan at the April meeting.  \u201cI think for organized labor to survive, it needs to start looking to organize people in un-organized sectors,\u201d Ross said. A seat at the council would let workers speak without fear of manager retaliation, he said.  However, bank leaders could be wary of giving workers more influence as a digital banking push changes its workforce needs, said Ben Bystrom, instructor at the Shidler College of Business in Hawaii.  Some members of the stakeholder council said they would be open to the idea of adding a worker.  \u201cMr. Sloan seemed amenable.

The bank has said it expects the asset cap to be lifted by the end of this year. Yet analysts believe mid-2020 is a more realistic time frame.  Executive turnover: Wells Fargo veterans lead many of the bank\u2019s main business segments, but fresh leadership at the top could spur additional senior departures, analysts said.  \u201cAnyone on that next level down who had hoped to be a CEO near term, that kind of squashes that possibility,\u201d said KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl. The new CEO may also decide to remove senior executives to bring in outsiders to refresh the culture.  Shoring up business fundamentals: Wells Fargo was the only large-cap U.S. bank to not increase the number of loans or deposits over the last two years, according to Refinitiv data. Investors will want to see a plan to expand the bank\u2019s core business.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo ATM machine is shown in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The Central Bank said Wells Fargo Bank International Unlimited Company admitted to five breaches from 2014 to 2019, including a failure to accurately report its capital position that revealed \u201cserious and systemic weaknesses\u201d in its reporting capability.  A spokesperson for Wells Fargo said the bank took its regulatory obligations seriously and had made significant improvements to its systems and processes since the breaches occurred.  Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, has been beset by a string of mis-selling scandals in its home market, prompting billions of dollars in fines and an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve.  Its Irish incorporated business has branches in London and Frankfurt, offering corporate lending across Europe, according to the bank\u2019s website. It had a turnover of $586 million in 2018, the central bank said.  \u201cIt is a minimum requirement of being regulated by the Central Bank that firms submit accurate and timely regulatory returns,\u201d Director of Enforcement Seana Cunningham said in a statement.  \u201cThis enforcement action refers to failings in relation to both capital reporting and liquidity testing. For that reason it is considered to be particularly serious.\u201d  The other breaches included a failure to properly document processes and procedures, the lack of robust board and senior management oversight and a failure to comply with regulatory requirements in relation to liquidity testing.  Weak IT systems also necessitated an excessively high level of manual adjustments in the preparation of regulatory returns, which the central bank said contributed to incorrect calculations.  Wells Fargo initially did not complete required remedial action in 2017 but has since taken the necessary steps to rectify the failings, the regulator said.  That reduced the fine from the \"appropriate level\" of 8.4 million euros ($9.46 million), in line with central bank settlement procedures. The 5.9 million euro fine is the second largest after a 21 million euro fine imposed on Irish lender Permanent TSP IL0A.I for overcharging mortgage customers, a central bank spokesman said.  It was also the second reprimand for an Irish subsidiary of a major U.S. bank in the space of 10 days after JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N was fined 1.6 million euros ($1.8 million) for regulatory breaches in outsourcing.","64":"March 6 (Reuters) - Wells fargo says it sued after being required to pay chicago mercantile exchange more than $16 mln to cover ljm\u2019s margin and losses Wells fargo said it had served as ljm\u2019s clearing futures commission merchant and agent prior to ljm\u2019s losses in early february Wells fargo says ljm failed to make its required margin payments to cover its losses, prompting the lawsuit for breach of contract Wells fargo securities sues ljm investment fund lp, ljm partners ltd for at least $16.4 mln over ljm\u2019s derivatives trading losses -- court filing Wells fargo files lawsuit against ljm in manhattan federal court","65":"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said on Thursday it would reduce its headcount by about 5 percent to 10 percent within the next three years as part of a turnaround plan.

REUTERS\/Jeenah Moon  Sitting inside the credit-resolution group, where Wells Fargo handles struggling borrowers, the team includes many bankers who previously worked with the same oil and gas producers in its investment bank.  They work alongside bankruptcy specialists who have been reassigned to focus exclusively on energy to help Wells Fargo wade through the expected flood of restructurings.  \u201cIt\u2019s a bloodbath,\u201d said one person with knowledge of the bank\u2019s oil and gas portfolio, who was not authorized to speak publicly.  Wells Fargo spokeswoman Michelle Palomino said Wells Fargo maintains a strong energy and power group within its corporate and investment bank. The bank is committed to helping borrowers in the energy industry during this challenging time, she added.  Global energy markets are awash with crude oil because of a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that boosted supply while demand was cratering due to the global coronavirus outbreak. The U.S. benchmark oil price briefly traded negatively last week for the first time in history.  The U.S. energy industry was already struggling with high debt levels and profitability problems before this maelstrom.  Bankruptcies have begun, with an April 7 survey of producers by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City forecasting 40% would be insolvent within a year if oil prices were $30 per barrel. That is nearly double the current value. [O\/R]  Banks have worried for months about their loans to U.S. oil and gas producers, which could not tap other avenues to raise money. Lenders have been trying to pare back exposure by, for instance, ascribing less value to the collateral behind reserve-based loans (RBLs), the energy industry\u2019s main source of cash.  Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N are considered to be the two largest lenders to U.S. energy companies. Citigroup Inc C.N had the largest energy loan book of any U.S. bank at the end of 2019 because of its international business.  As of the end of March, Wells Fargo had $14.3 billion of oil and gas loans outstanding, according to filings.  REVIVALS  Roughly 15% of Wells Fargo\u2019s oil and gas team now reports to the credit resolution group on a special energy team, two bank sources said. The corporate banking energy group had already been reduced by about 7% after a round of layoffs last summer.  Bart Schouest, who heads Wells Fargo\u2019s energy lending unit, and Michael Thomas, a restructuring executive, are leading the new team.  It is reminiscent of another workout team Wells Fargo assembled in 2015, as oil was plunging from over $100 per barrel the prior year to a nadir of $26 in early 2016.  That group wound down in 2017 as the market recovered, although not before Wells had experienced billions of dollars in losses on its energy book.  Wells Fargo\u2019s exposure to the industry has fallen by roughly $3 billion since then and bank sources say the bank learned lessons that should help it navigate this storm, but many are still preparing for the worst.  The industry\u2019s largest lenders have studied how they would take ownership of energy assets if borrowers proved unable to repay their debts to banks, and some are preparing to set up legal entities which would own stakes in seized properties.  Wells Fargo is instead hoping to capitalize of its internal resources. The special workout team is a way for Wells Fargo to manage relationships during the current downturn, hoping to maintain ties with those that survive, sources said.","70":"(Adds context and background on CEO search, quotes)  WASHINGTON, May 15 (Reuters) - A top U.S. bank regulator said on Wednesday it will vet Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s pick for its next chief executive, a development that could complicate the scandal-hit lender\u2019s efforts to find a permanent replacement for CEO Tim Sloan.  Joseph Otting, the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), told Congress he would use special legal powers that the regulator typically reserves for overseeing financially troubled lenders to review any proposed candidate.  But Otting said he does not plan to make findings from the review public, despite pressure from U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren who pressed him on the issue during a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.  \u201cAt this point in time I do not have plans to release that information,\u201d Otting told Warren in a heated exchange.  Warren and other Democratic lawmakers have accused the OCC of being too soft on Wells Fargo, a claim Otting disputed on Wednesday.  Otting said the OCC remains disappointed by the bank\u2019s progress on fixing risk management and governance problems that led to a number of customer abuse scandals, including in its mortgage and auto lending businesses.  A spokesman for Wells Fargo did not immediately provide comment.  Sloan abruptly departed in late March, making him the second CEO to leave Wells Fargo following its sales practice scandal. He has said he stepped down because the external attention on him had become a distraction.  Wells Fargo general counsel C. Allen Parker, one of the few newcomers in the bank\u2019s top ranks, is serving as interim CEO.  Intense congressional and regulatory scrutiny is likely to narrow the field of CEO candidates. Wells Fargo\u2019s board is looking for an outsider following criticism that company veterans are incapable of turning things around.  The bank\u2019s CEO search is also being hampered by limits on how much it can pay, Reuters reported this month.  Wells Fargo\u2019s woes began in September 2016 when the bank admitted it had potentially opened millions of unauthorized accounts. Internal and regulatory probes have discovered other issues in the bank\u2019s businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines and penalties.  The Federal Reserve has also placed an unprecedented restriction on Wells Fargo to keep it from growing its balance sheet until it proves risk management controls are improved.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo logo is seen at the SIBOS banking and financial conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada October 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Chris Helgren  When he started as CEO jobs in that past, Scharf focused on learning about the companies but at Wells Fargo, the need to develop controls has brought a sense of urgency, he told employees on Tuesday at Wells Fargo\u2019s campus in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Scharf, 54, took over the CEO role on Oct. 21, as the bank entered its fourth year of a wide-ranging sales practices scandal.  Approved by regulators and cheered by investors as an outsider who could bring fresh perspective to Wells Fargo\u2019s C-suite, he must now try to settle outstanding regulatory probes, repair the bank\u2019s image and improve morale among staff.  Scharf said he is up to the task.  \u201cWe all have to act a little bit more impatient for some of these things, and demand more of each other,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to constantly ask the question, \u2018Can we do a better job? Can we do something faster?\u2019\u201d  Scharf came to Wells Fargo after CEO stints at Visa V.N and Bank of New York Mellon BK.N and several years working in the top ranks at JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N. His first days on the job were spent at board meetings in St. Louis and then with regulators and senior management at the bank\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco, he said.  This week, he met with regulators and politicians in Washington and with other key executives including Chief Risk Officer Mandy Norton in Charlotte.  In the town hall meeting, Scharf said he is trying to bring a fresh sense of urgency to solving Wells Fargo\u2019s regulatory woes. The bank has already paid billions of dollars in fines and legal settlements, faced 14 consent orders with government agencies and remains under an unprecedented growth restriction on its balance sheet by the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Other strategy decisions like growth targets are secondary.  Sources who have worked with Scharf described him has a detail-oriented leader who is more at home with numbers than people. However, during he town hall, his first event with the company, Scharf framed himself as a family man who places a lot of value on relationships, especially with his yellow Labrador, Bebe.  Winning over employees is also key for Scharf to achieve operational targets while those matters move toward resolution. Wells Fargo has posted sluggish revenue growth and had trouble cutting expenses since the scandal erupted in September 2016.  Initially, the sales abuses centered around millions of phony customer accounts but eventually revealed overcharges on auto and home loans and other improper practices. In an internal survey this year, just 38% of employees said they felt senior management understood obstacles faced by workers. With roughly 262,000 employees, Wells Fargo has the largest employee base of the major U.S. banks.","73":"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N has laid off more than 200 bankers in its U.S. lending divisions in recent months, as the bank reacted to business trends and restructured some units, sources familiar with the matter said this week.  FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith  Most of the cuts were in Wells Fargo\u2019s commercial bank and many impacted its team that gives loans to farmers. The bank has also made cuts to its energy lending group. Energy and agriculture are two portfolios in which the company is traditionally strong.  The fourth-largest U.S. lender by assets cut the unit that specializes in agricultural lending by at least 25%, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the matter.  Representatives for Wells Fargo confirmed the cuts but did not elaborate on how many agricultural bankers were laid off.  Over the summer, 22 bankers were axed from its energy team, according to two other sources. The cuts represented about 7% of the energy group, a spokeswoman said.  The energy lending team sits within the investment bank and the agriculture group is part of commercial banking. The company has about 6,000 commercial bankers in the United States.  Many of the agriculture cuts were concentrated in rural areas, one source told Reuters, including North Dakota and South Dakota where staff was cut in half. Wells Fargo plans to create a smaller group of agricultural bankers in one of its new centralized hubs who will work with customers, the person said.  While the move marks Wells Fargo\u2019s latest bid to centralize operations and shed risk, the move comes as a blow to energy companies and increasingly cash-strapped farmers.  With fewer bankers on hand in local markets, some small companies and family farmers will likely need to find a new lender, said three sources familiar with the businesses.  The staffing cuts are particularly ill-timed for the bank\u2019s soybean, corn and grain farm customers, who are looking to renew loans to finance their spring planting operations.  Wells Fargo is the biggest bank lender to the U.S. agriculture sector, according to the American Bankers Association. An Wells Fargo executive told Reuters the bank intends to retain that position and there has been no strategic move to reduce exposure. The moves were made because the commercial bank wants to align resources to better serve clients who do more business with the bank.  The bank is currently hiring agricultural bankers in markets like California, Wyoming and Idaho, a bank spokeswoman said. After the hires the total reduction to the team will be 5%.  SCALING BACK  Federal data analyzed by Reuters shows Wells Fargo is following other large U.S. banks in scaling back exposure to farmers. The bank\u2019s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured units have pared $1.24 billion, or 15.3%, of their farm-loan holdings between the end of December 2016 and June 30 of this year, according to the most recent data from the regulator.  Wells Fargo has also been traditionally regarded as one of the most active lenders to the U.S. oil and gas sector. But its energy team was still recovering from hefty losses it booked in 2016, when crude prices plunged to $26 a barrel and forced a number of bankruptcies in the sector. (here)  The unit created a separate credit resolution group to try to work with customers to stem the losses. Since then the bank has put less emphasis on lending, two of the sources said. Also, the Energy Capital Group has been rolled into its larger strategic capital group.  Another Wells Fargo spokeswoman, Hannah Sloane, said the bank remains committed to the sector and has expanded the business over the past three years.  \u201cWe regularly review and evaluate the needs of our clients and the dynamics in the markets we serve in order to ensure we align our resources accordingly,\u201d she said.  Wells Fargo has been working to centralize operations to improve risk controls since 2016, when a wide-ranging sales practices scandal erupted and placed the bank under a regulatory microscope. The Federal Reserve has prevented the bank from increasing its balance sheet until it believes it has made significant changes to its risk management and compliance structures.  Revenue in Wells Fargo\u2019s wholesale bank, which houses the merged banking unit, has fallen every year since the scandal and fell another 2% during the first six months of 2019.

Separately, a worker advocacy group said it plans to raise pay issues on Tuesday at the shareholder meeting in Des Moines, Iowa.  Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan earned $17.6 million for 2017, according to its proxy filing, an estimated 291 times the median of the annual total compensation of all the bank\u2019s workers.  It is easy for Sloan to be optimistic about the future of the bank considering he is collecting a raise \u201con an already enormous salary,\u201d wrote Vernes Rasidkadic, who left a job at Wells Fargo in Omaha, Nebraska, shortly after posting comments in mid-March.  Rasidkadic told Reuters he stands by his posted comments.  After several days, Wells Fargo closed the notice board to new posts, writing that some comments do not comply with company policies, according to the internal discussion. A company spokeswoman confirmed the discussion had been closed.  When asked about the postings on Friday, a Wells Fargo official said the bank values constructive feedback.  \u201cWe will continue to invite team member participation and encourage dialogue,\u201d said spokeswoman Diana Rodriguez.  The bank in 2016 admitted employees had opened potentially millions of sham accounts for customers in order to hit sales targets, which led to the departure of its previous CEO. Sloan did not collect a cash bonus in 2016 and in 2017, although his total compensation for 2017 was 35 percent higher than for 2016.  Wells Fargo's CEO pay ratio was higher than Bank of America Corp's BAC.N but lower than JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, according to data U.S. public companies must report starting this year. Those lenders have different business mixes and Wells Fargo skews more than some toward lower-paid retail workers.  Wells Fargo raised its minimum hourly wage to $15 an hour in March, an 11-percent hike for about 36,000 workers, it announced in December on the heels of the U.S. tax code overhaul.  The Committee for Better Banks, a group that includes labor unions and consumer and community advocacy groups, is calling for the bank to raise that wage again to $20.  A representative for the group said Alex Ross, a Wells Fargo employee and activist with Better Banks, plans to comment on pay at the shareholder meeting and say that a raise would in turn help the bank\u2019s mission of rebuilding community trust following the scandal.  On Friday, the bank said it agreed to pay U.S. regulators $1 billion to settle probes into customer abuses in auto lending and mortgages. A review of bank pay by executive compensation data firm Equilar shows Sloan earned roughly 20 percent less than Bank of America and Goldman Sachs Group GS.N paid their leaders for 2017.  Among top Wells Fargo shareholders, representatives for Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N did not respond to questions on how it planned to vote its roughly 9-percent stake in the bank. A representative for the second-largest investor, Vanguard Group Inc, with a roughly 7-percent stake, declined to comment on its votes at the bank.

Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. lender by assets, has leaned on cost cuts to stabilize its bottom line while its revenue growth has been sluggish. However, a raft of fines and costs relating to sales abuses first uncovered in 2016 have been hard to control.  Scharf said the bank\u2019s cost structure is simply too high, and pledged to improve performance once he gets through regulatory issues that need attention.  \u201cThere is no reason why we shouldn\u2019t have best-in-class efficiency with these businesses at this scale, and that ultimately will be our goal,\u201d the new chief executive said on a call with analysts.  He declined to give specific targets or a time frame for reaching them.  Wells Fargo shares fell about 4% to $50.01.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Cost-cutting was also a cornerstone of former CEO Tim Sloan\u2019s recovery plan, but the bank acknowledged last year that technology and compliance costs would remain high as it tried to satisfy regulators.  Wells Fargo\u2019s non-interest expenses jumped 17% in the fourth quarter compared with the year-earlier period, due to the litigation costs, as well as higher compensation expenses.  It spent 78.6 cents for every dollar of revenue it generated, up from 63.6 cents a year earlier, and far above Sloan's targeted range of 55-59 cents per dollar, or rival JPMorgan Chase & Co's JPM.N 55.9 cents.  Investors watch that ratio closely to determine how well a company manages expenses.  Wells is operating under heavy scrutiny as it tries to rebuild its reputation, including an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve and frequent criticism from prominent U.S. politicians.  Its problems began to unfold in September 2016, when the bank revealed that employees had opened potentially millions of bogus accounts in customers\u2019 names without their permission to hit sales targets set by management. Since then, Wells Fargo has found other problematic practices that cost customers money or otherwise harmed their financial well-being.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Scharf is the fourth CEO in place since that time, and investors are hopeful he can finally get his arms around the problems.  Although the bank has reached settlements with some regulators and private parties, there are still outstanding probes by U.S. authorities, including the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. It also operates under consent orders with regulators, as well as the Fed\u2019s asset cap.  Scharf would not provide guidance on when Wells Fargo might resolve its regulatory issues.  Wells Fargo\u2019s profit fell to $2.55 billion, or 60 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $5.71 billion, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier.  Its adjusted earnings of 93 cents per share compared with analyst estimates of $1.12, on average, according to Refinitiv. Revenue of $19.86 billion came in below expectations of $20.12 billion.  The bank\u2019s net interest income fell 11% as the Fed lowered interest rates three times last year to support the economy.  However, its mortgage business benefited from lower rates, with income rising to $783 million from $467 million.

Feb 21(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co has racked up well over $7 billion in penalties since a sales practices scandal erupted in 2016, and continues to face headwinds. Here are some of the remaining shoes that have yet to drop: More hearings: The House Financial Services Committee said on Friday that it will conduct three Wells Fargo hearings next month where new Chief Executive Charles Scharf and other company officials will be probed about the scandal. The bank\u2019s executives have in the past been called to testify before Congress about the bank\u2019s wrongdoings and explain how the bank has changed. Scharf has tried to place the scandal squarely in the past, describing \u201chistorical\u201d and \u201clegacy\u201d issues, but lawmakers will rehash Wells Fargo\u2019s mistakes in public.  Consent orders: Wells Fargo is currently operating under roughly 14 consent orders with various regulators including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the orders, the bank will endure intense regulatory scrutiny until it proves it has fixed procedures that allowed employees to create potentially millions of unauthorized accounts, and sell auto insurance and other add-on products that customers did not want or need. The orders also require Wells Fargo to repay customers for costs associated with its consumer abuses. So far the bank has paid out at least tens of millions of dollars in remediation.  Asset cap: The most notable consent order looming over the bank is the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s asset cap, which put an unprecedented growth restriction on the bank\u2019s balance sheet until it proves that it has overhauled its risk management and controls. Since the asset cap was announced in early 2018, bank executives repeatedly extended the timeline for getting it removed and have since stopped giving any guidance on the issue. On his first public conference call last month, Scharf did not set a new timeline.  Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating: Even if Wells Fargo\u2019s asset cap is lifted, its growth could still be hampered by its CRA rating, which assesses how well banks service poorer communities. In 2017, federal regulators downgraded Wells Fargo two notches to \u201cNeeds to Improve\u201d from \u201cOutstanding\u201d shortly after the scandal broke. The rating, which is typically only reviewed every five years, curtails the bank\u2019s ability to make acquisitions and open branches, and requires Wells Fargo to seek regulatory approval in financing decisions like issuing or prepaying debt. A less than satisfactory rating also prevents the bank from courting certain government business.

Overall, the U.S. banking sector is benefiting from a cut in corporate tax rates, hikes in interest rates and a growing economy that is driving demand from borrowers while holding down loan loss rates.

Wells Fargo executives said each of the bank\u2019s 12 director nominees received more than about 89 percent support from investors and about 92 percent of shares were cast in favor of the pay of Chief Executive Tim Sloan and other leaders.  The figures amounted to a relatively strong outcome, especially when compared with last year. At the bank\u2019s 2017 meeting in Florida, only three of the board\u2019s 12 directors received more than 90 percent of shareholders\u2019 support, and then-Chairman Stephen Sanger received just 56 percent approval.  On average, S&P 500 directors usually get around 92 percent, and pay is backed by around 89 percent of votes cast, according to pay consultant Semler Brossy.  Jill Fisch, a University of Pennsylvania Law School professor and corporate governance expert, said it is a sign that investors are giving the bank\u2019s new board members and other changes a chance.  \u201cThe company has made a lot of dramatic moves, and shareholders seem to be saying they appreciate it and are going to wait to see if they are successful,\u201d said Fisch.  Though occasionally confronted by protesters and skeptics, Sloan and bank Chair Elizabeth Duke mostly stayed on their message of atonement during the gathering, which lasted about 2-1\/2 hours.  \u201cWe have made mistakes, and we\u2019ve acknowledged those mistakes,\u201d Sloan said at one point.  Sloan and Duke both faced tough questioners but also received loud applause at several points from the audience of several hundred in the Des Moines Marriott hotel ballroom.  When California State Treasurer John Chiang rose to challenge Sloan\u2019s pay, Duke responded that \u201cI disagree with your analysis of it. Tim\u2019s time with the company is an advantage,\u201d a comment that received louder applause.  Speaking before the meeting, individual investor Cherie Mortice of Des Moines said she voted for Sloan and other directors, saying it was worth giving the bank a chance to recover.  \u201cI think he\u2019s kind of hoping to restore trust. I\u2019m really hopeful,\u201d she said.  The event came days after Wells Fargo said it would pay regulators $1 billion to settle matters related to mortgage and auto lending abuses.  Just before the meeting started, about 100 protesters marched into the lobby of the hotel holding signs for causes including predatory lending reforms and controls on lending to firearm companies. A few protesters scuffled briefly with guards, who prevented them from entering the meeting.  The bank had already agreed to publish a review of business standards, prompting shareholders led by the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia to withdraw a resolution that demanded details on the cultural and ethical causes of recent scandals.  In 2016 the bank admitted employees had opened potentially millions of sham accounts, triggering a leadership revamp. Regulatory issues have persisted, with the Federal Reserve in February ordering it to halt growth until governance and controls improve.  Wells Fargo, though based in San Francisco, has held the meeting in other locations in recent years, including Florida and St. Louis.  Tuesday\u2019s meeting at moments laid bare divisions in Iowa over the role of the bank, one of the state\u2019s largest private employers. State leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver, a Republican, spoke to welcome executives and to recount the bank\u2019s help in local development or business loans.  But others questioned whether Sloan and others were right for the task of reform.  \u201cIf I ran my farm the way Wells Fargo ran their business, I\u2019d be kicked out of Marshall County. I\u2019d be a failure,\u201d said one speaker, who identified himself as a retired Iowa farmer.  Wells Fargo\u2019s home mortgage and home equity businesses has about 14,500 workers in and around Des Moines.  Wells Fargo shares were down 11 cents, or nearly one-tenth of a percent, at $52.50 on Tuesday afternoon.","87":"The city of Sacramento, California, has sued Wells Fargo for allegedly targeting minorities for high-cost mortgages that frequently end in foreclosures.

In the past the bank\u2019s lobbying efforts had been modest, but over the past 18 months, Wells Fargo has added more than 15 people to its Washington team, tripling its size, and is still hiring. The bank has also contracted big-name firms including Ogilvy and Federal Street Strategies, whose principals previously worked for powerful lawmakers, financial regulators or President Donald Trump, according to interviews and filings reviewed by Reuters.  Wells Fargo has also been highlighting millions of dollars spent on programs dedicated to homelessness, housing for veterans and financial literacy in key lawmakers\u2019 districts to win back their favor, bank representatives said.  \u201cWe have a lot of projects in a lot of communities that we are proud of, and we do have those conversations with elected officials,\u201d David Moskowitz, head of government relations and public policy at the fourth-largest U.S. lender, told Reuters. \u201cOur plan is to engage with virtually everyone on Capitol Hill on both sides of the aisle.\u201d  Moskowitz said he expected his team to meet with important government officials or staff almost every day.  Wells Fargo launched its charm offensive to limit the blowback from a sales scandal that erupted in September 2016, with revelations that employees opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers\u2019 names without their permission. The bank has disclosed other problems since then, including enrolling hundreds of thousands of customers in costly products such as auto insurance, that they did not need or want.  In an unprecedented move in February, the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed an asset cap on Wells Fargo. In April, two U.S. regulators jointly fined the bank $1 billion for mistreating auto borrowers. Authorities including the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Labor are still conducting their own probes.  WHIPPING BOY  Each negative headline about Wells Fargo extends how long the bank will remain in the regulatory doghouse, said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based Compass Point Research & Trading.  \u201cThere\u2019s a belief among some policymakers that Wells Fargo wants to right the ship and that it will take time to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the meantime they will remain the rhetorical whipping boy for lingering populist anger.\u201d  The scandal-related fallout has started to hit Wells Fargo\u2019s profits as it needs to work harder to win new customers and additional marketing costs keep expenses high. In the first half of the year, Wells Fargo earned $10.3 billion, 10 percent less than a year earlier. Its full-year profits before taxes are expected to be 5 percent lower, according to Refinitiv.  The bank\u2019s Washington team is trying to shift the conversation to what the bank is doing now for communities and away from the misdeeds of the past. Success could mean fewer negative headlines and a looser regulatory leash.  In interviews, Wells Fargo representatives said they had been telling lawmakers what the bank is doing to remedy customer abuses and prevent them from happening again. They also offer up the bank\u2019s expertise on lending and economic trends, tout the number of people Wells Fargo employs in lawmakers\u2019 districts and outline philanthropic programs that appeal to them.  For instance, Wells Fargo said it has provided $11.3 million in down payment help to homeowners in Los Angeles, which is represented in part by Democrat Maxine Waters.  Waters is positioned to chair the House Financial Services Committee if Democrats take control of that chamber in the Nov. 6 mid-term election and has been one of Wells Fargo\u2019s harshest critics in Congress.  She has said expanding access to affordable housing would be a top priority as committee chair. Wells also says it has donated over $10 million to various nonprofits in Waters\u2019 district over the last two years.  Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan has asked Waters for a meeting, her representative said, and bank representatives met with her staff in July.  \u201cShe looks forward to meeting with him once their schedules align,\u201d said Charla Ouertatani, staff director for Waters on the House Financial Services Committee.  Wells Fargo also donated $3.3 million last year to nonprofits and schools around Baltimore represented by Democrat Elijah Cummings tipped to chair the House Oversight Committee, if his party wins.  \u201cThere are many exceptional organizations that are transforming lives in Baltimore and throughout Maryland with limited resources,\u201d Cummings said in a statement. \u201cWhenever Wells Fargo or any company chooses to assist their efforts, I applaud that decision.\u201d  If Democrats take control of the House, Waters and Cummings would enjoy broad authority to examine Wells\u2019s business operations, as well as demand bank executives testify on past wrongdoing if they saw fit.  Wells Fargo said the bank had also donated $4.5 million to nonprofits across Iowa in 2017, a fact it highlights to the state\u2019s mostly Republican lawmakers, including Senator Chuck Grassley, who chairs the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee.  LONG PATH  In total, Wells Fargo has pledged to give away $400 million to charitable causes in 2018, and 2 percent of after-tax profits in following years. That could position it as the top corporate cash donor in the United States, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which tracks corporate giving. The bank was the top donor among financial firms in 2017 and the second-largest among corporations. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2QJzGJr)  In 2015, prior to the sales scandal, the bank donated $281 million, though Wells credits tax cuts implemented at the start of this year for part of this year\u2019s increase.  Even with those good deeds in hand, Wells Fargo will probably remain in the political crosshairs for some time, according to analysts and congressional staff.  On Oct. 4, Senate Banking Committee Democrats called for Sloan and Wells Fargo Chair Elizabeth Duke to testify about \u201cwidespread and persistent failures at the bank.\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s plan to cut its workforce by up to 10 percent is also attracting ire from Democrats.  The bank has to make up ground with regulators too. Last week, Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting told lawmakers he was \u201cnot comfortable\u201d with the bank\u2019s efforts to make things right with 600,000 auto loan borrowers. During the hearing, Hawaii Democrat Brian Schatz characterized the bank as \u201cbeyond repair.\u201d  Wells\u2019s efforts have been noticed, but the reception has been mixed, according to members of Congress and staff interviewed by Reuters.  While some say the bank is taking the right steps on a long path to a repaired reputation, distrust of banks stills runs deep, particularly among Democrats. Some lawmakers, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, have said the bank is still not doing enough to right past wrongs.  Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, said Wells Fargo has a lot more work to do before lawmakers will take its efforts seriously.  \u201cTrust is a tricky thing,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a lot easier to lose it than it is to gain it.\u201d","89":"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said on Tuesday it will pilot its own digital currency powered by blockchain to help move cash across borders and between branches in real time.

The system will allow the bank to bypass third parties in the asset transfer process saving costs and time, said Lisa Frazier, head of the Innovation Group at Wells Fargo.  \u201cWe are eliminating the intermediaries which can often extend the timeline to be able to do cross border money transfers,\u201d she said.  The fourth largest U.S. bank\u2019s corporate clients will not have to make any changes to the way they interact with the bank since the currency will not be client-facing.  The pilot will begin next year but the bank has tested the technology by moving money between Canada and the United States. Following the broader roll-out the company hopes to expand to multi-currency transfers.  Though Wells Fargo executives have been bullish on the potential for blockchain technology in financial services, the company has been more skeptical of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin which launched the system into the spotlight.  Last year, Wells Fargo joined U.S. rivals in banning the purchase of Bitcoin by credit-card customers, due to the volatility of the investment.  Blockchain technology has attracted billions of dollars in investments from banks and other companies, but concerns about implementation and scalability has hindered many blockchain projects so far.  Early roadblocks have not stopped banks from experimenting aggressively in the space.

REUTERS\/Chris Helgren  The settlement was filed late Thursday with the federal court in San Francisco, and requires a judge\u2019s approval.  It resolves claims that the officials breached their fiduciary duties by knowing about or consciously disregarding the bogus accounts, and failing to stop their creation.  Insurers for 20 current and former Wells Fargo executives and directors, including Chief Executive Tim Sloan and his predecessor John Stumpf, will pay the $240 million to the bank. The officials denied wrongdoing.  Wells Fargo spokesman Peter Gilchrist declined to comment on Friday.  The San Francisco-based bank has been beset by scandals over its sales practices since agreeing in September 2016 to pay $190 million to settle government claims that it created the customer accounts without permission.  Outrage over the settlement and the bank\u2019s handling of the fallout led to Stumpf\u2019s departure. Other sales abuses later surfaced, including Wells Fargo\u2019s charging for unnecessary auto insurance and imposing excessive mortgage fees.  The shareholders in Thursday\u2019s settlement were led by pension plans in Alabama and Colorado.  Their lawyers called the accord the largest insurer-funded cash settlement in a U.S. shareholder derivative lawsuit, surpassing News Corp\u2019s $139 million accord in 2013 over its handling of a phone hacking scandal in Britain.  Shareholders bring derivative lawsuits on behalf of companies, typically when the defendants are corporate officers or board members, with proceeds going to the companies.  Last May, Wells Fargo reached a $480 million settlement of a securities fraud lawsuit brought by shareholders over the unauthorized accounts.  On Wednesday, Wells Fargo said it might have to pay up to $2.7 billion more than it had set aside as of Dec. 31 to resolve legal matters, up from $2.2 billion three months earlier.  In January, Wells Fargo issued a report saying it had improved risk oversight and accountability, including by eliminating sales goals and clawing back compensation from executives.  Sloan nonetheless remains under pressure, and faces calls from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat running in the 2020 presidential campaign, for his ouster.

Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc will report the following Monday, followed by Bank of America Corp and Morgan Stanley on Tuesday.  In the wake of the Federal Reserve\u2019s cautious shift due to signs of softness in the U.S. economy and the subsequent drop in 10-year Treasury yields, S&P 500 banks are seen posting year-on-year first-quarter earnings growth of 2.3%, down from 8.2% forecast six months ago, according to Refinitiv data.  (For an interactive graphic on evolving bank earnings estimates click, tmsnrt.rs\/2HOVt1D)  \u201cThe Fed pivoted so abruptly, which gives one pause about what they\u2019re saying about the economy,\u201d said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. \u201cFlat to falling interest rates are not good news for bank interest margins. It\u2019s not surprising that analysts are taking down earnings estimates.\u201d  The central bank\u2019s change in tack put the brakes on what had been a pattern of quarterly rate hikes, amid signs of slowing economic growth.  Slowdown jitters have also hit 10-year Treasury yields. The benchmark bond\u2019s yield hit a 15-month low in the first quarter, flattening the yield curve and narrowing the gap between the interest banks pay depositors and the interest they charge consumers, which is bad news for profits.  \u201cThat\u2019s why the estimates are going down,\u201d Carlson added. \u201c(Analysts are) fearful of interest margins for banks and there\u2019s an underlying concern about loan growth.\u201d  In the first three months of the year, the S&P 500 bounced back from a sell-off in December, gaining 13.1%, its biggest quarterly increase since 2009. But financials underperformed the wider market, gaining 7.9% in the quarter as the new low-interest-rate normal that boosted other sectors was a headwind for banks.  Since October, analysts have drastically lowered their expectations for S&P 500 earnings in 2019, with first-quarter estimates dropping from 8.1% growth to a year-over-year decline of 2.2%. That would mark the first quarter of negative growth since the earnings \u201crecession\u201d that ended in 2016.  The partial federal government shutdown in January and an expected drop in trading revenues provided additional impetus for analysts to cut first-quarter bank earnings estimates.  In a KBW note dated April 3, lead analyst Brian Kleinhanzl sees median year-on-year revenues from both equities and fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading to have dropped by 15% in the quarter.  \u201cWithin financials, the industry that\u2019s been hit hardest is capital markets,\u201d said Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Refinitiv on London. \u201cThose downward revisions have intensified over the last 90 days. Of the big 6 banks, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have seen the biggest declines\u201d in first-quarter earnings estimates.  But some analysts believe the effects on banks of a more accommodative Fed and the flattened yield curve are overstated.  Oppenheimer lead analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a March 25 note \u201cto be sure, rates and the yield curve have had an effect on bank earnings.\u201d But he called the impact from the Fed\u2019s decision \u201ca minor one,\u201d and wrote that aside from these impacts, \u201cbank fundamentals are remarkably stable.\u201d  Recent history shows that large U.S. financial institutions have beat analyst estimates at a higher rate than the broader market. In the eight most recent quarters, the six banks have beat earnings estimates 83.3% of the time on average, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 75.4% average beat rate. Additionally, bank revenues surprised to the upside 79.2% of the time, while S&P 500 company revenues came in ahead of analyst estimates 68.3% of the time, per Refinitiv data.  (For a graphic on 'U.S. banks beat\/miss track record' click, tmsnrt.rs\/2Vmv2DP)  In today\u2019s late-cycle reality, however, it is not clear that banks can beat even lowered expectations. Either way they should set the tone for what analysts predict will be a rocky earnings period.  \u201cPsychologically, these are bellwether companies that tend to drive sentiment,\u201d Dhillon added, suggesting that their quarterly reports are proxy indicators of corporate earnings health. \u201cBanks are up there.\u201d","94":"WASHINGTON\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N must keep a lid on its growth until the bank has hardened its risk management policies to prevent any further abuse of its customers, said Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve.

Wells Fargo has so far failed to satisfy the Fed and the bank is months behind schedule on submitting an acceptable reform plan, Reuters reported last week.  A bank representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Powell\u2019s letter. Wells Fargo executives have previously said that they expect the cap to be lifted during the first half of next year.  Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has been a vocal critic of Wells Fargo and its Chief Executive Tim Sloan. In October, Warren wrote a letter asking the regulator not to remove the asset cap until Sloan is removed, charging that Sloan was \u201cdeeply implicated\u201d in the misdeeds of the past. Wells Fargo has called Sloan\u2019s 30-year tenure at the bank an asset and said he has the full support of its board.  On Monday, Warren faulted the bank for being late with its reform plan and said Sloan must go.  \u201cWells Fargo is already months behind,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \u201cIf the Fed is serious about changing the practices at Wells Fargo that have cost customers their homes or cars or credit scores, it must insist on new leadership at the bank.\u201d  The Wells Fargo sanctions were rooted in a sales practices scandal that broke open in 2016 when it was reported that employees had opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers\u2019 names without their permission. In his letter to Warren, Powell wrote that what happened inside the bank was \u201coutrageous,\u201d but declined to say whether or not Sloan should continue to lead the bank.  Since the phony accounts scandal, Wells Fargo has said it found abuses in auto insurance, small business loans, mortgage lending and other business lines.  Once Wells Fargo has satisfied the terms of the February settlement, Powell wrote, the Fed board will decide whether or not the bank can grow.  \u201cThe decision about terminating the asset growth restriction imposed on Wells Fargo will be made by a vote of the Board,\u201d Powell wrote in the Nov. 28 letter.","95":"A federal judge in California has dismissed a proposed class action by a Texas jewelry company accusing Wells Fargo & Co of encouraging thousands of retailers nationwide to charge hidden fees to customers using a finance program created by the bank.

Starting on Aug. 1, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup C.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N said they will reduce rates by 25 basis points to 5.25%.  The banks use different names, with Citi calling this its \u201cbase rate,\u201d and JPMorgan and Wells Fargo referring to it as a \u201cprime rate.\u201d  However, lowering this benchmark rate means lower interest rates on loans that are based off the Fed\u2019s main short-term rate. The move could result in lower revenues for the banks in the coming quarters.  Earlier on Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut the overnight lending rate to a target range of 2.00% to 2.25% due to concerns about the global economy and muted U.S. inflation.  The U.S. central bank signaled a readiness to lower borrowing costs further if needed.  Although banks were expected to lower rates in line with the Fed, the moves were notable because rates had been rising for more than a decade.  The last time JPMorgan reduced its prime rate was in December 2008, when it cut the rate to 3.25% from 4%. The bank maintained a 3.25% prime lending rate for the next seven years, eventually raising it to 3.5% in December 2015.","103":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has rejected Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s plans to prevent further consumer abuses and told the scandal-plagued lender it needs stronger checks on management, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.  A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith  The concerns raised by the Fed, which have not been previously reported, are likely to increase the time it takes the central bank to lift an asset cap it imposed on Wells Fargo in February following a string of sales practices scandals.  The bank must draw up a robust plan to improve its governance and risk management controls before the Fed will lift the cap and in February Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan said the bank was \u201con the fast track\u201d to meeting those conditions.  Both the Fed and Wells Fargo declined to comment on the specifics of the review.  On Thursday, the bank said it was working to satisfy the Fed\u2019s concerns and that the process was ongoing.  \u201cWe work diligently to address feedback provided,\u201d the bank said in a statement. \u201cThis is an ongoing, iterative process.\u201d  In April, Wells Fargo submitted its plan, expecting the Fed to sign off on it over the summer, but the central bank instead told the country\u2019s fourth-largest lender to go back to the drawing board, the people said.  The settlement requires Wells Fargo to toughen board oversight, repay customers hurt by past abuses, and make more than 20 other improvements to its governance, risk management and compliance controls.  It also required the plan to be approved, implemented and an independent third-party review completed by Sept. 30, but the bank has missed this deadline, the people said.  That alone could have triggered further sanctions under the terms of the settlement, but the Fed has granted Wells Fargo more time to satisfy the February order, the sources said.  Wells Fargo executives and Fed officials have haggled for months over what controls are needed to make sure the bank can detect problems before they become full-blown scandals, the people said.  On Tuesday, bank CEO Sloan told CNBC that the bank now expects the cap will be lifted in the first half of 2019, instead of this fall. He added that discussions with the Fed regarding the operational and risk compliance aspects of the plan were ongoing.  \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to make progress, but we need to demonstrate that we\u2019re deserving of the asset cap being lifted,\u201d Sloan said.  The bank told investors in May that it expected the asset cap to hurt profits by only $100 million.  Over the past nine months, Sloan has met several times with Fed Governor Lael Brainard to try and agree on the specifics of the new plan, said two sources. Betsy Duke, a former Fed governor who now sits on the Wells Fargo board, has joined Sloan in those meetings, they added.  Reuters could not ascertain how close the two parties were to an agreement. However, even if the Fed blesses Wells Fargo\u2019s plan before year-end, the settlement still requires the bank to hire outside firms to perform an independent review of the bank\u2019s operations - work that is expected to take months.  In May, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said removal of the cap would also be put to a vote of the board of governors.","104":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional committee will ask Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s board of directors to testify about the bank\u2019s sales scandal next year, a senior Democrat told Reuters on Thursday.  Lawmakers want to press the board on its role in righting the bank after years of problems, said Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get some of their board members up here, and see what kind of responsibilities their board members are taking for the management of Wells Fargo,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have hearings, absolutely.\u201d  Wells Fargo declined to comment.  The bank\u2019s executives have been called before Congress multiple times since a wide-ranging sales scandal erupted in 2016, but board members have so far avoided direct public interrogation. The majority of Wells Fargo\u2019s current directors joined the board after the scandal came to light.  Former chief executives John Stumpf and Tim Sloan stepped down shortly after testifying before lawmakers in 2016 and 2019, respectively.  Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, is too big to be properly managed and should be broken up, Waters said.  The San Francisco-based bank is on its third chief executive since 2016. Charles Scharf, the former CEO of Bank of New York Mellon, took the lead role at the bank in October. Scharf sits on the bank\u2019s board, which is currently chaired by Elizabeth Duke, who once served on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors.  Wells Fargo has been under intense scrutiny in Washington since revelations that employees opened potentially millions of fake accounts emerged more than 3 years ago.The bank is currently operating under more than a dozen regulatory consent orders, including an unprecedented growth restriction on its balance sheet from the Fed until the bank proves it has fixed its risk controls. Additionally, Wells Fargo faces federal probes by the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Labor.  Clearing Wells Fargo\u2019s regulatory hurdles is the top priority for Scharf, who has already started making changes in his 2 months at the company. So far he has tapped his trusted adviser and former Obama administration chief of staff, Bill Daley, to lead public affairs and named his former colleague, Scott Powell, as chief operating officer to focus on the bank\u2019s regulatory issues.","105":"(This May 10th story corrects paragraph 7 to say Wells Fargo may need to match stock-based compensation a candidate has at a current employer, not that company may need to match vested shares.)  FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith\/File Photo  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s hunt for a new CEO is being impeded by limits on how much the bank can pay its next leader, a person close to the search and several industry insiders told Reuters.  A handful of top candidates have already said they would not pursue the job because Wells Fargo is unlikely to meet their pay requirements, said the person, who spoke about private negotiations on the condition of anonymity.  Wells Fargo declined to comment on the search process.  The San Francisco-based bank has been looking for a new leader since March, when Tim Sloan became the second CEO to abruptly depart in the wake of a sales scandal that has badly bruised the bank\u2019s reputation and crimped its financial performance.  Wells Fargo\u2019s CEO pay package has trailed peers in recent years in the aftermath of a wide-ranging sales practices scandal. Wells Fargo is also the smallest of the top four retail banks by assets.  The board will likely pay the next CEO $15 million-$20 million a year, said Robin Ferracone, the chief executive of compensation consultancy Farient Advisors LLC. That compares with the $25 million that CEOs of top retail banks earned last year on average.  Wells Fargo may also need to set aside funds to match stock-based compensation a candidate has at a current employer, compensation consultants and recruiters said. That could be difficult in an environment where politicians, regulators and investors are closely scrutinizing Wells Fargo.  \u201cIf you think about the Wells situation, it has a lot of distressed features to it,\u201d Ferracone said.  The banking industry faces special restrictions on compensation that regulators imposed after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Relative to other sectors, a bigger portion of executive pay comes in deferred stock, and contracts feature clawback provisions, which require money to be paid back under certain circumstances.  Among peers, Wells Fargo\u2019s CEO pay package is at the bottom of the pack.  Sloan\u2019s $18.4 million pay package last year compared with $31 million for JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s Jamie Dimon, $26.5 million for Bank of America Corp\u2019s Brian Moynihan and $24 million for Citigroup Inc\u2019s Michael Corbat.  Executives in other industries, and even other parts of Wall Street, get paid significantly more.  Blackstone Group LP CEO Stephen Schwarzman, for instance, earned $69.1 million last year. Alphabet Inc Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, a former Morgan Stanley executive considered a solid candidate for a bank CEO role, earned $47.3 million.  Wells Fargo Chair Betsy Duke has said the board wants to attract the \u201ctop talent in banking.\u201d Directors want the next CEO to be an outsider, following critiques from lawmakers that company veterans are incapable of turning things around.  The board has discussed approaching JPMorgan's finance chief, Marianne Lake, as well as Citigroup's head of Latin America, Jane Fraser, Reuters previously reported reut.rs\/2PvxOo0. They have unvested stock awards worth $18.4 million and $11.2 million, respectively, according to recent filings.  Offering a signing bonus to cover such awards is harder at banks than other types of companies because of heightened scrutiny on the sector, industry experts told Reuters.  Last year, UBS Group AG\u2019s Andrea Orcel left the Swiss bank to run Banco Santander SA. But the deal fell apart after Santander refused to pay Orcel $50 million in deferred compensation he accrued at UBS.  There may be even bigger hurdles in Wells Fargo\u2019s case because of the sales scandal that erupted in late 2016. Regulators including the U.S. Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are also closely monitoring progress of its operational overhaul, including executive changes.  The new CEO\u2019s pay package is sure to be \u201cvery carefully scrutinized,\u201d said Evan Stewart, who litigates compensation disputes as a partner at the law firm Cohen & Gresser.","106":"A federal judge in Manhattan has rejected Wells Fargo Advisors\u2019 bid to overturn an arbitrator\u2019s decision allowing class arbitration of an employees\u2019 overtime dispute, saying the bank has to live with the outcome after imposing arbitration on the employees.

Picture taken October 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Chris Helgren  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co and its officials have racked up well over $4 billion (3 billion pounds) in penalties since a sales practices scandal erupted in 2016, and continues to face headwinds.  Here are some of the remaining shoes that have yet to drop:  Probes: A number of federal agencies are examining the bank and its employees for potential wrongdoing. The Department of Justice is looking into whether executives withheld details about fake accounts to the Wells Fargo board of directors and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the lead regulator for national banks, Reuters has reported. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Philadelphia office, meanwhile, has been investigating whether Wells Fargo misled investors by inflating performance metrics and whether the bank penalized whistleblowers, Reuters also reported. The Department of Labor is also examining whether the bank acted on staff whistleblower complaints.  Consent orders: Wells Fargo is currently operating under roughly 14 consent orders with various regulators including the OCC, SEC, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the orders, the bank will endure intense regulatory scrutiny until it proves it has fixed procedures that allowed employees to create potentially millions of unauthorized accounts, and sell auto insurance and other add-on products that customers did not want or need. The orders also require Wells Fargo to repay customers for costs associated with its consumer abuses. So far the bank has paid out at least tens of millions of dollars in remediation.  Asset cap: The most notable consent order looming over the bank is the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s asset cap, which put an unprecedented growth restriction on the bank\u2019s balance sheet until it proves that it has overhauled its risk management and controls. Since the asset cap was announced in early 2018, bank executives repeatedly extended the timeline for getting it removed and have since stopped giving any guidance on the issue. On his first public call with the company earlier this month, new Chief Executive Charlie Scarf did not set a new timeline.  Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating: Even if Wells Fargo\u2019s asset cap is lifted, its growth could still be hampered by its CRA rating, which assesses how well banks service poorer communities. In 2017, federal regulators downgraded Wells Fargo two notches to \u201cNeeds to Improve\u201d from \u201cOutstanding\u201d shortly after the scandal broke. The rating, which is typically only reviewed every five years, curtails the bank\u2019s ability to make acquisitions and open branches, and requires Wells Fargo to seek regulatory approval in financing decisions like issuing or prepaying debt. A less than satisfactory rating also prevents the bank from courting certain government business that requires a higher CRA rating.  More hearings: The bank\u2019s executives have in the past been called to testify before Congress about the bank\u2019s wrongdoings and explain how the bank has changed. New CEO Scharf has tried to place the scandal squarely in the past, describing \u201chistorical and \u201clegacy\u201d issues during his first call, but lawmakers are likely to continue rehashing Wells Fargo\u2019s mistakes in public. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, House Financial Services Committee chair, said she plans to call Wells Fargo board members to testify this year.","108":"(Reuters) - A Chicago fund manager that suffered catastrophic losses in a market plunge this year has blamed the actions of its broker, a Wells Fargo & Co unit, according to court documents filed on Wednesday.

A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo said in a statement: \u201cWe will defend ourselves and strongly disagree with LJM\u2019s claims.\u201d  LJM founder Anthony Caine said in a letter to clients in February that working with its clearing broker, LJM \u201cagreed that liquidation across all client accounts, regardless of clearing broker, was the most prudent action given market volatility and portfolio risks.\u201d  Wells Fargo Securities has asked the court to help it retrieve $16.4 million, saying the brokerage covered LJM\u2019s margin and losses with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Wells Fargo previously declined to comment on Caine\u2019s account.  LJM, which along with the affiliate managed more than $1 billion earlier this year, has not answered questions since the company and the affiliate reported their funds\u2019 losses. LJM later told clients it would return what was left of their money.

REUTERS\/Carlos Barria  He also made the assertion in a company-wide memo June 18 that announced diversity initiatives as nationwide protests broke out following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American man, in police custody.  \u201cWhile it might sound like an excuse, the unfortunate reality is that there is a very limited pool of black talent to recruit from,\u201d Scharf said in the memo, seen by Reuters.  Scharf spent more time listening than speaking during the previously unreported 90-minute call which he initiated. His comments about Black talent rubbed some attendees the wrong way, according to the two employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared repercussions.  Not all attendees recalled being offended. \u201cThe meeting was incredibly constructive. ... I walked away being incredibly surprised at how genuine and sincere he is,\u201d said Alex David, president of the Black\/African American Connection Team Member Network.  But several Black senior executives across corporate America said they are frustrated by claims of a talent shortage, and called the refrain a major reason that companies have struggled to add enough racial and ethnic diversity to leadership ranks, despite stated intentions to do so.  \"There is an amazing amount of Black talent out there,\" said Ken Bacon, a former mortgage industry executive on the boards of Comcast Corp CMCSA.O, Ally Financial Inc ALLY.N and Welltower Inc WELL.N. \"If people say they can't find the talent, they either aren't looking hard enough or don't want to find it.\"  Bacon said he was \u201cshocked and puzzled\u201d by Scharf\u2019s comments.  Wells Fargo spokeswoman Beth Richek defended Scharf\u2019s record on diversity.  The CEO of the largest U.S. bank employer has pledged to double the number of Black leaders over five years and tied executive compensation to reaching diversity goals. He is also requiring hiring managers to consider diverse candidates for high-paying roles that are vacant, and ensure diversity on interview teams.  Since Scharf joined the bank a little less than a year ago, it has added two Black executives to its operating committee - Lester Owens, head of Operations; and Ather Williams, head of Strategy, Digital and Innovation.  Wells Fargo\u2019s latest proxy disclosed more diversity data than those of many other companies, including that two of 12 directors at the time were Black and one was \u201cLatino\/Hispanic.\u201d  Scharf \u201cis committed to deep and systemic change to increase diversity and has held several forums where there has been candid conversation and unfiltered feedback,\u201d Richek said in a statement.  \u201cTALENT IS THERE\u201d  Introspection across corporate America during the Black Lives Matter movement has cast a harsh light on the lack of diversity. In boardrooms, African-Americans made up 10% of new director appointments in the Fortune 500 last year compared with their 13% of the U.S. population, according to a 2020 report from executive recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles. New Hispanic directors were even more scarce, the study found.  Only 7.3% of the five highest-paid executives at financial companies in the Russell 3000 were racial or ethnic minorities, according to data from ISS ESG, an arm of the proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services. That number has risen in recent years, yet remains far below the percentage of minority groups in the general U.S. population.  Senior corporate executives and recruiters said the notion of a shallow minority talent pool is frequently cited as a hurdle to improving diversity but probably reflects insular professional and social networks.  Lauren Holland, who chairs a word-of-mouth professional network called Wall Street Friends, said she has 8,000 members in minority communities, and sent out more job posts to them in the last two months than in the last five years.  \u201cI literally get emails every single day from people asking to be added to our list,\u201d she said. \u201cThe talent is there. It\u2019s just a matter of the firm accessing it and connecting with it.\u201d  NOT ENOUGH PROGRESS  Experts said one reason board rooms and C-suites lack diversity is that such jobs are often filled by people who have managed businesses, while many people of color have tended to be stuck in roles that lack a direct connection to profits.  \"As women and minorities started to gain traction in corporate America, they were trapped in certain jobs companies felt comfortable placing them in, like human resources, administrative-support type functions,\" said Teri McClure, former general counsel and chief human resources officer at United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N, who sits on several boards, including that of JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O.  McClure said she frequently hears comments like Scharf\u2019s when companies have not tried hard enough to find diverse candidates or give them the experience to qualify for senior roles.  Some Black directors and executives said they were unhappy with the progress in improving diversity.  \"Unless I practically get on a soapbox about it and ask about it every meeting, it gets pushed out,\" said Mary Winston, a director at companies including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG.N, about some of her past work on boards. \"It's just not as robust a conversation as it should be, and no progress has been made.\"  Winston, adding that she is often the only person of color in board rooms, also disagreed with the notion of a talent shortage.

Sloan will be the first bank executive grilled by the House Financial Services Committee since it was taken over by Democrats following the 2018 congressional election. A nervous Wall Street is keen to see how hostile the panel will be towards the industry.  The hearing could see Sloan clash with panel chair and vocal bank critic Maxine Waters, as well as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a rookie lawmaker and leading voice of her party\u2019s progressive wing. Fellow freshman Katie Porter likewise built her campaign on bashing Wall Street.  Republicans have also criticized Wells Fargo, and will likely want proof the fourth-largest U.S. bank has addressed customer abuses.  The CEOs of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc , Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp are expected to appear before the House panel next month.  Stakes are high for 31-year Wells Fargo veteran Sloan, who was appointed CEO when John Stumpf retired soon after the sales practices scandal erupted in 2016. Sloan has faced calls to step down from investors and politicians, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 Democratic presidential contender.  On Tuesday, Sloan will emphasize changes the bank has made to culture, sales practices and risk management, as well as efforts to repay wronged customers.  \u201cWells Fargo is a better bank than it was three years ago, and we are working every day to become even better,\u201d Sloan, 58, will say, according to testimony published on Monday.  Lawmakers could also ask about the bank\u2019s decision to cut thousands of U.S. jobs, its pledge to boost stock buybacks and its forced arbitration policy for customers.  Spokespeople for Waters and Ocasio-Cortez declined or did not respond to comment requests. Porter said in a statement that Sloan has \u201ca lot to prove\u201d to show Wells Fargo has turned a corner.  If lawmakers are unhappy with what they hear, they could pressure the Federal Reserve to maintain restrictions imposed on the bank\u2019s growth until governance and risk management improve.  Sloan has not appeared before Congress since a 2017 Senate hearing, where he clashed with lawmakers from both parties.  Wells Fargo has since deployed more lobbyists in Washington and launched a public relations offensive, but remains in politicians\u2019 crosshairs.

In a statement, Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said management takes their concerns seriously.  The scheduled hearing is one of three focused on Wells Fargo, which has been beset by scandal since 2016, when it acknowledged its employees opened potentially millions of phony accounts in order to meet unrealistic sales targets. Last week, the bank reached a $3 billion deal with U.S. authorities over the matter - the latest in a string of costly settlements and regulatory penalties.  Since then Wells Fargo has overhauled performance goals, compensation formulas and risk management to avoid such problems in the future. However, the advocacy group says problems still exist, citing layoffs, excessive workloads and a stressful work environment.  Brian Jackson, a Wells Fargo mortgage underwriter who is part of The Committee for Better Banks, said the group has helped elevate concerns that might otherwise be ignored.  \u201cThey\u2019re able to work with Congress and representatives and kind of gives us a voice where they\u2019ll actually do something about it,\u201d Jackson told Reuters.  The group has been trying in vain to get management\u2019s attention for years. (reut.rs\/2zV73TF) Charlie Scharf is the fourth Wells Fargo chief executive in place since the 2016 scandal. The group has not gotten an audience with any of the CEOs, but they have had success with Federal Reserve governors, Vermont Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and an Iowa lawmaker who used Wells Fargo employees as the face of her campaign to prevent offshoring.  In response to their most recent request for a meeting, Scharf suggested the employees talk to the head of human resources and operating chief instead. However, future meetings have not been ruled out, Folk said.  \u201cCharlie takes employee concerns seriously and will continue to consider opportunities to meet with these employees as part of his ongoing internal engagement,\u201d he said.

While strength in mortgage banking and cheap valuations could provide support to the S&P 500 bank index, its performance depends on what reassurance executives provide on credit conditions, the outlook for loan growth and their ability to reduce deposit costs during their conference calls.  Tuesday brings third quarter profit reports from Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo and Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and Goldman Sachs. Bank of America reports on Wednesday.  The biggest U.S. banks will report a 1.2% decline in third-quarter earnings, while revenue is seen rising 0.9%, according to data aggregated by Refinitiv analyst David Aurelio. This would be the first profit decline since the same quarter in 2016, according to data from Factset.  \u201cOverall it\u2019s shaping up to be a pretty challenging quarter because of the net interest rate environment,\u201d said Fred Cannon, director of research for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York, citing the flattening and temporary inversion of the U.S. Treasury 2-year\/10-year yield curve during the quarter.  Bank profits depend heavily on net interest income, or the difference between the rate they charge for long-term loans and the rate they pay for short-term borrowing.  Executives from Citi, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan all cut their full-year forecasts for net interest income last month, citing macroeconomic concerns.  Part of the problem is U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in July and September. And futures traders are betting on more Fed rate cuts going forward, including one in October.  As a result, bank investors will listen for executive reassurance on the net interest margin outlook and their ability to mitigate weakness, said Manulife Investment Management\u2019s Lisa Welch, who manages the John Hancock Regional Bank Fund.  FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 9, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  One offset to lower lending profits would be a reduction in interest rates banks pay their customers for deposits, as those rates rose while the Fed was hiking interest rates.  \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of questions on how fast banks are able to bring down their deposit costs as loan yields are coming down,\u201d said Welch, adding that she does not expect deposit costs \u201cto come down as quickly as loan yields have fallen.\u201d  Mortgages may be another silver lining to lower rates in third-quarter numbers and future quarters as borrowers avail of cheaper rates. Refinancing, which accounts for most mortgage applications, has more than doubled from a year ago, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data released on Wednesday.  \u201cWith rates being lower, we think mortgage activity will be very strong,\u201d said Welch, pointing to First Horizon as one bank that could benefit from mortgage demand.  Bank of America and Wells Fargo should also benefit, according to KBW\u2019s Cannon. To cope with rising demand, Wells Fargo is boosting its mortgage team, according to a memo seen by Reuters this week.  But investors will also be on high alert for signs slowing U.S. economic growth is hurting debt repayments, said Mike Cronin, investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments.  \u201cGiven that we\u2019ve had some economic data that\u2019s been a little weaker is there any trend in credit costs that raises concerns going into 2020?\u201d said Cronin.  So far, strong credit quality and bank balance sheets have reassured KBW\u2019s Cannon, who is neutral on the sector. \u201cBut if we start to see meaningful credit deterioration that would change our minds about how we think about the banks,\u201d he said.  Cannon did not recommend buying banks going into earnings season due to the likelihood \u201cconsensus estimates come down in the quarter.\u201d But on the plus side, he said, valuations do seem to reflect an expectation for further weakness.  (GRAPHIC - S&P bank index valuation vs S&P 500: )  The S&P Bank index has gained 14% year-to-date, compared with a 16.5% advance for the S&P 500. But the sector\u2019s trading multiple of 10.2 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months compares well to its historical average of 12.6 and the benchmark S&P\u2019s current trading multiple of 16.4.  Bank valuations look attractive to Manulife\u2019s Welch, who does not expect a recession any time soon.  \u201cIf we\u2019re wrong and go into a mild recession we think the banks will hold up much better\u201d than going into financial crisis, she said, citing underwriting improvements.  But, after a spate of weak manufacturing data, Aberdeen Standard\u2019s Cronin is looking for data to stabilize before recommending the sector.  \u201cThere is a lot of downside priced into the stocks but overall I\u2019d still say I\u2019m not really positive on the group just yet,\u201d he said.","119":"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, is offering fewer home loan products during the coronavirus-fueled economic downturn, a spokesman said on Monday. The bank has paused many kinds of loans including cash-out refinance loans, most home equity loans above $250,000 and riskier non-conforming purchase loans, according to a memo seen by Reuters and confirmed by the company.  Applications for those loan types were automatically turned down as of Friday.  Underwriting some of those loans has become harder, and Wells Fargo suspended home interior inspections last week after governments across the country urged or mandated social distancing, the spokesman said. Some rivals are working around the problem by doing drive-by appraisals or having customers take pictures of properties with their phones, bank sources said.  The change comes as the coronavirus pandemic has put increased pressure on Wells Fargo\u2019s balance sheet which has been capped by regulators since 2018. The U.S. Federal Reserve restricted the bank\u2019s balance sheet at 2017 levels until it can prove it has the risk management structures which led to the 2016 sales practices scandal.  Up to now, the bank has been operating with room under its $1.95 trillion dollar cap, but amid tense demand for cash, Wells Fargo has said the cap is preventing it from helping customers and lending more.  The bank is shunning riskier non-conforming loans with downpayments of less than 20% and home equity lines of credit above $500,000, according to the memo. Home equity loans above $250,000 on properties worth more than $1 million or for 2-4 unit properties are being declined.  Wells Fargo is the largest U.S. mortgage lender, originating $201 billion in 2019, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.  \u201cThese difficult business decisions reflect efforts to prioritize how we serve customers and maintain prudent balance sheet discipline,\u201d spokesman Tom Goyda said.  \u201cHigh-balance conforming loans will be originated only as agency loans and will not be placed on our balance sheet.\u201d  Conventional loans guaranteed by agencies like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac move quickly off a bank\u2019s balance sheet as they are packaged into mortgage securities to be sold to investors. But non-conforming loans with smaller downpayments and large home equity lines of credit are considered riskier and may stay on the bank\u2019s books.  The bank has also stopped buying non-conforming loans from third parties and will only accept jumbo refinancing applications from customers with at least $250,000 at the bank, the spokesman said.","120":"Nov 2 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co on Monday appointed Kleber Santos as head of a newly created diverse segments, representation and inclusion group, effective Nov. 9.

Santos, who will focus on creating a more diverse and inclusive working environment, will report to Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf.

The U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee released the findings of its year-long probe into the bank ahead of hearings next week that will see its new chief executive, Charles Scharf, and its chair, Betsy Duke, testify before the committee for the first time.  Drawing on internal emails and meeting notes, the report paints a picture of a complacent Wells Fargo board and management who did not take seriously settlements the bank agreed with federal regulators between 2016 and 2018 to resolve charges it had abused customers.  A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo said the bank was reviewing the report.  Specifically, according to the report, Wells Fargo\u2019s board of directors allowed management to repeatedly submit materially deficient plans to regulators in response to the consent orders. The report said the regulators, for their part, failed to hold Wells Fargo accountable for its wrongdoing.  The report also says former Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan gave \u201cinaccurate and misleading testimony\u201d to Congress during a March 2019 committee hearing when he said the bank was in compliance with a 2018 consent order issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) relating to mis-selling of mortgages and auto loans.  Emails between OCC staff-members late showed that the bank was not in compliance with one of two aspects of the order\u2019s customer remediation plan, and that the OCC staff concluded that Sloan gave inaccurate testimony to Congress, the report says.  Sloan could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday evening. Spokespeople for the OCC did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  Wells Fargo has paid out more than $7 billion in fines and penalties related to the scandal since 2016, including to the U.S. Department of Justice. Internal and external probes have uncovered issues in each of Wells Fargo\u2019s major business lines, including wealth management and the commercial bank.  Over the past three years, Wells Fargo has taken various steps to fix the issues and rebuild trust with customers, investors and regulators. That includes changes to its board, centralizing risk teams and hiring an external chief executive.","122":"Wells Fargo & Co lost a long-running multimillion-dollar tax battle on Friday, as a federal appeals court held that a structured trust it formed in 2003 was an elaborate and unlawful tax-avoidance scheme.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo stagecoach is seen at the SIBOS banking and financial conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada October 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Chris Helgren\/File Photo  The bank said much of the lending decline had to do with moves to avoid riskier loans, but the second-quarter results ignited fears about lingering reputational damage from Wells Fargo\u2019s phony accounts scandal and other customer abuses.  The total average loan balance for the bank shrank 1 percent in the quarter from a year earlier as its consumer loan book fell by 2 percent and commercial real estate lending slowed.  Wells Fargo has been running down financial crisis-era mortgage portfolios and dialing back lending in other businesses like autos where it sees too much risk.  Its most recent pullback is in commercial real estate lending, where Wells Fargo executives say competition among other lenders has caused a broad decline in underwriting standards.  \u201cAs it relates to underwriting standards, it\u2019s not all bank-to-bank competition ... the competition here is just broad as it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told analysts, pointing to real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds and other capital sources.  Wells Fargo shares were down 0.9 percent in afternoon trading.  Analyst pressed Wells Fargo executives on a call to discuss the results about when they could expect to see a turning point. The bank could soon ramp up auto lending again, the executives said, without giving a specific time frame.  \u201cI would say that we\u2019re happy that it was sort of stabilized and we\u2019re now viewing the origination path is growing,\u201d Shrewsberry said.  The bank\u2019s mortgage business weighed on the income it makes from fees, which fell 8 percent in the quarter to $9 billion.  Intensifying price competition for mortgages hurt margins and borrower prepayments cut into servicing fees. The bank also said a program that helps customers avoid overdraft charges dented fee income.  Even with loan balances falling, the bank\u2019s net interest income rose 1 percent, helped by higher interest rates.  JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N said on Friday its average core loans rose 7 percent from a year ago.  One consequence of Wells Fargo\u2019s slow loan and deposit growth is that the bank does not have to worry about bumping up against a regulator-imposed cap on its balance sheet.  The Federal Reserve has ordered Wells Fargo to keep assets below $1.95 trillion until the bank\u2019s governance and controls improve.  Total non-interest expenses rose 3 percent to $14 billion, with the bank noting that marketing costs from a rebranding effort to help repair damage to its reputation added to costs.  The bank said it also took a $619 million operating loss hit in the quarter for compensating customer harmed by foreign exchange, mortgage, auto lending and wealth management issues.  The lender\u2019s expenses per dollar of revenue have remained stubbornly high after the phony accounts scandal erupted in 2016. Wells Fargo has vowed to cut costs by shrinking its branch network, overhauling internal departments, combining certain business areas and other measures.  Net income applicable to common stock fell to $4.79 billion, or 98 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $5.45 billion, or $1.08 per share a year ago.

It will continue to operate 48 branches in Wisconsin, as well as its commercial banking, wealth management, and retail brokerage business across the region.  The transaction is part of a strategy management laid out at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo\u2019s investor day last month, involving the sale or closure of 800 branches by 2020.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Wells Fargo gave regulators the plan in June, as required by a $1 billion settlement the bank reached with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in April.  After reviewing the plan - which could involve contacting some 600,000 drivers - the OCC told Wells Fargo it needed more assurances that the bank would find and repay everyone who was overcharged, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the rejection.  The rejection is the latest wrinkle in Wells Fargo\u2019s long-running sales scandal, which began in September 2016 with revelations that the bank had opened perhaps millions of accounts in customers\u2019 names without permission to hit aggressive sales targets.  Since then, Wells has disclosed more customer abuses in businesses including mortgage lending, wealth management and the auto loans at issue here.  Representatives for Wells Fargo, the OCC and the CFPB declined to comment.  Drivers who bought a car through Wells Fargo and let their insurance lapse could be charged for \u201cforced-place\u201d policies. Wells enrolled about 2 million drivers into such policies and more than a quarter of those were not needed, officials have said.  Customers who were charged for unneeded insurance could face overdraft fees, damaged credit or vehicle repossession. As part of its settlement agreement, Wells Fargo had to review several years\u2019 worth of bank and insurance paperwork for those customers.  Although Wells Fargo gave regulators details on the number of customers harmed, what financial consequences they suffered and how the bank planned to compensate them, the OCC wants to see work behind the calculations before it will approve the plan, the sources said. The regulator also wants an explanation of how workers are performing day-to-day remediation tasks, they said.  The OCC does not have a deadline for when it must approve the plan, but Wells Fargo cannot finish its work without that all-clear from regulators.  It is not unusual for banks and regulators to haggle over the fine print of a settlement, and large banks tend to satisfy regulator demands quickly after a large penalty, said the sources and former officials.  Last year, Wells Fargo estimated that it would need $64 million to pay back customers but lawyers representing drivers say that estimate is way too low.","133":"A federal judge in San Francisco on Thursday will consider whether hundreds of homeowners can pursue a lawsuit accusing Wells Fargo of foreclosing on them because of a computer glitch they blame on the bank\u2019s lax oversight.

The San Francisco-based bank has received \"formal and informal inquiries from federal and state governmental agencies regarding its offering of PPP loans,\" it said in a regulatory filing without elaborating. (bit.ly\/3b6ctuF)  A spokesman declined to comment on the nature of the probes.  Wells Fargo faced a string federal investigations for most of the last three years after a sales practices scandal erupted in 2016. It wrapped up the last major probe into the issue in February, in a $3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission.Small businesses have filed lawsuits against U.S. banks including Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America alleging unfair practices in processing loans under the program, including prioritizing larger loans over smaller ones.  Wells Fargo started taking applications for the $350 billion rescue fund on April 4, one day after the official launch and a day later than Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  As of April 27 the bank had submitted more than 100,000 PPP applications to the Small Business Administration for review, Wells Fargo spokesman Manuel Venegas said on Tuesday.  Companies with fewer than 25 employees account for 90% of those applications and 80% generate less than $2 million in annual revenue. The average loan size was less than $110,000, Venegas said.  Wells Fargo initially capped its participation in the program at $10 billion due to the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s punitive curbs on increasing its balance sheet following its sales practices scandals. The bank expanded its role after getting permission to make loans under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act without counting them against the asset cap.","139":"(Reuters) - Charlie Munger, the longtime business partner of fellow billionaire Warren Buffett, said on Wednesday it is time for regulators to \"let up\" on Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, which will end up \"better off\" as it corrects a series of mistakes in how it treated banking customers.  FILE PHOTO: Berkshire Hathaway Inc Vice Chairman Charles Munger speaks at the Daily Journal annual meeting in Los Angeles, U.S., February 15, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  Munger spoke at the annual meeting of Daily Journal Corp DJCO.O, the Los Angeles-based newspaper publisher he chairs, where he also denigrated bitcoin BTC=BTSP as \"noxious poison\" and urged reforms in the healthcare system.  He spoke less than two weeks after the Federal Reserve took the unprecedented step of curbing the San Francisco-based bank\u2019s asset growth until it fixes its shortcomings.  Daily Journal typically draws little attention from investors, but CNBC broadcast the meeting on its website.  That is because the company's star attraction is Munger, 94, who has for four decades also been vice chairman at Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N, which is Wells Fargo's largest shareholder.  \u201cOf course, Wells Fargo had incentive systems that were too strong in the wrong direction, and of course they were too slow in reacting properly to bad news,\u201d but \u201cpractically everyone\u201d makes those kinds of mistakes, Munger said.  \u201cWells Fargo will end up better off for having made those mistakes,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for regulators to let up on Wells Fargo. They\u2019ve learned.\u201d  The San Francisco-based bank has been beset by scandals for deceiving customers, such as by opening unauthorized accounts and forcing them to take out auto insurance they did not need.  Wells Fargo shares gained 2.7 percent to $59.55 on Wednesday.  Though Wells Fargo may be learning its lessons, Munger said the banking industry remains a \u201cdangerous\u201d place to invest because of the temptation for chief executives to take unwise long-term risks to boost short-term results.  Buffett has credited Munger with broadening his investment horizon, and to seek out great companies at fair prices rather than emphasizing fair companies that can be bought cheaply.  BITCOIN IS \u2018TOTALLY ASININE\u2019  For Munger, that leaves no room for bitcoin, saying the recent \u201ccraze\u201d in the cryptocurrency is \u201ctotally asinine\u201d and a means for people to make a quick buck. He urged the government to help wring out its excesses.  \u201cBitcoin is noxious poison,\u201d Munger said. \u201cThe more popular it got the more I hated it.\u201d  Munger also endorsed the plan announced by Berkshire, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N to set up a healthcare company for their employees to combat spiraling costs that Buffett has called a \"tapeworm\" on the economy.  The current system \u201cruns out of control on the cost side,\u201d causing behavior that is \u201cregrettable\u201d and \u201cevil,\u201d Munger said.  \u201cIt\u2019s not right to bleed so much money out of our dying people,\u201d Munger said. \u201cI\u2019m all for somebody trying to figure it out.\u201d  Munger also expressed concern about rising U.S. government debt levels, calling it \u201cnew territory for us,\u201d though he expressed no alarm about the current economy.  He said higher inflation may follow, and that long-term U.S. Treasuries, whose prices can fall quickly as yields rise, remain a losing bet over the long haul.  Munger fielded questions for two hours. He and Buffett, 87, are expected to field shareholder questions for an even longer period, five hours, at Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting on May 5.  Given their ages, that meeting is likely to be among their last, and Berkshire is preparing for their succession.  Last month, it promoted executives Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to vice chairmen, overseeing non-insurance and insurance businesses, respectively. They are widely considered the frontrunners to succeed Buffett as chief executive officer.  Alluding to his age, Munger on Wednesday said he was \u201cvery surprised to be here,\u201d and drew laughter by referring to a woman who said on her own 94th birthday: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased to be here. In fact I\u2019m very pleased to be anywhere.\u201d","140":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co has not convinced U.S. regulators it is doing enough to repay 600,000 drivers who were wrongly pushed into buying auto insurance, a leading bank regulator said on Tuesday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cWe are not comfortable where we are with them,\u201d Joseph Otting, the Comptroller of the Currency, said at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee.

Otting\u2019s office this summer rejected Wells Fargo\u2019s plan to repay customers who were pushed into unnecessary auto insurance and told the bank it must do more to find and compensate every driver who was hurt, Reuters reported in September.  The rejection was the latest setback for Wells Fargo which has been rocked by two years of scandals over its sales practices.  In September 2016, the bank paid a $190 million fine after admitting employees had opened perhaps millions of phony customer accounts to hit sales goals.  In April, the bank paid a $1 billion fine to U.S. regulators for auto insurance and mortgage lending abuses and promised to make sure customers were repaid.  Drivers who bought a car with a loan from Wells Fargo and let their insurance lapse could be charged for \u201cforced-place\u201d policies. The bank enrolled about 2 million drivers into such policies and more than a quarter of those were not needed, officials have said.  The OCC does not have a deadline for when it must approve the plan, but Wells Fargo cannot finish its work without that all-clear from regulators.  Democratic Senator Brian Schatz asked Otting when Wells Fargo customers should expect a refund for the faulty charges.  \u201cI don\u2019t have the particular date in front of me,\u201d Otting said, but he said he trusts OCC employees to push the bank to get the job done correctly.","141":"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co's WFC.N compliance chief is leaving after two years of trying to turn around the scandal-plagued bank's internal oversight and risk management functions, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the decision.

The agreement also includes a provision for payments worth up to $150 million from Principal to Wells Fargo that are tied to exceeding revenue retention targets.

The buyback news weighed on Principal\u2019s stock, which was 2.5 percent lower in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. Wells was down 1.4 percent.

It has been operating under heavy scrutiny since 2016 revelations that employees opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts.  The fallout has led to multiple internal and regulatory probes and resulted in billions of dollars in fines over the past three years.  Executives declined to specify the litigation the expected charge is related to.  The largest lingering legal issues include investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commision and the Department of Justice, according to filings.  \u201cWe\u2019ll all be happier when it moves through and is behind us,\u201d Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on a conference call with journalists.  Expenses also have risen since 2016 as the company has reimbursed customers who were overcharged for its services, and as the bank upgraded its technology to meet regulatory requirements in the wake of the scandal. This year the bank said it was hiring thousands of employees to improve its risk management and work through regulatory mandates, which has partially offset cost savings elsewhere in the bank.  Additionally, the bank acknowledged that plans to beef up its mortgage business and add staff to meet a surge in demand would contribute to costs this year. The plans, which Reuters exclusively reported on last week, is a change of course after the bank laid off more than 1,000 employees in the division last year.  Overall for the quarter the company posted falling loan revenue due to lower interest rates, but showed deposit and loan growth, a sign of increased business.  Net interest income fell 7.5% to $11.63 billion and average loans and deposits rose 1.3% and 1.9%, respectively.

The San Francisco-based lender, which reported a quarterly profit, said it may have to restate results to reflect the final settlement. The proposed penalties were reported earlier this week by Reuters.  Analysts said that while the $1 billion penalty would not make a significant dent to its balance sheet, it may take the bank some time to repair the damage to its reputation.  Shares of the bank fell 3.4 percent to $50.89.  \u201cOperationally, Wells Fargo can recover, but reputationally and how a billion dollars will weigh on them - only time can tell,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B.

The bank, still smarting from a prolonged sales scandal in its retail banking business, found inconsistencies at its auto lending and mortgage in the summer of 2017 - leading to further probes by regulators.  To appease investors and regulators, the bank overhauled its operational structure, shook up its board and hired a new compliance officer.  But this failed to impress the U.S. Federal Reserve, which imposed restrictions in February on the bank\u2019s growth, forbidding it to expand its balance sheet beyond 2017 levels until it makes internal changes that addressed risk management.  \u201cA bank\u2019s balance sheet is the engine for profit growth,\u201d said Kyle Sanders, analyst at Edward Jones. \u201cThe constraints on Well\u2019s ability to take on deposits and make new loans will likely result in lagging earnings growth for Wells relative to peers in the near-term.\u201d  Wells estimates restrictions on balance sheet growth will cut annual profit by $300 million to $400 million this year.

Total noninterest expenses for the first quarter rose 3.3 percent to $14.24 billion.  Sloan reiterated his 2019 cost savings target, and said his non-interest expense dollar target range for full-year 2018 remains unchanged.  In January, the company had said it remained committed to reducing its expenses by $2 billion by the end of 2018.  Total revenue in the quarter fell 1.4 percent to $21.93 billion. Total loans slipped 1.2 percent to $947.3 billion, hurt most by a decline in average loans in its community banking unit, which includes consumer banking.  Non-interest income from mortgage banking, an area where the bank supersedes its peers, fell 23.9 percent due to rising interest rates.

On Sept. 8, 2016, the CFPB and two other regulators announced they had reached settlements totaling $190 million with Wells Fargo after discovering the third-largest U.S. lender had opened as many as 2.1 million bank and card accounts in customers\u2019 names without their permission.  The number of potentially affected customers subsequently grew to 3.5 million as Wells expanded its probe of sales abuses.  The CFPB\u2019s portion of the settlement was $100 million, making it the largest fine in the agency\u2019s short history.  The settlement sparked a flurry of internal back-patting among enforcement officials in the days that followed and, unusually, drew applause from other banks, according to internal emails published following a Freedom of Information Request.  \u201cI have had a number of bankers reach out to me to express gratitude for the CFPB\u2019s action against [Wells Fargo] and disgust that such a situation occurred,\u201d Gary Stein, a manager in the CFPB\u2019s office of deposits, wrote in an email to Melissa Baal Guidorizzi, senior counsel for enforcement, on Sept. 12, 2016.  \u201cWhile many were from community banks, not all were. I don\u2019t recall an action like this we have taken getting so much applause and so little pushback.\u201d  The next day, Baal Guidorizzi forwarded the feedback to the broader CFPB enforcement team, the documents show.  \u201cSeems that the case was popular even in the banking community. I am hoping that this feedback will help balance some of the concerns about \u2018industry\u2019 reaction in our future work. Congratulations again to the team!\u201d she wrote.  Wells had long been celebrated on Wall Street for its \u201ccross-sell\u201d ratio, which measured its ability to sell multiple products to each customer. But the metric had been questioned by envious rivals who struggled to achieve the same results.  In interviews after the Wells Fargo scandal erupted, executives from other banks told Reuters they believed Wells went awry by measuring employee performance through sales and product numbers in its retail operation, rather than using customer service metrics.  The bankers said at the time that while incentive programs differed, it was standard across the industry to incorporate customer feedback when considering employee rewards.  Wells has since changed the way it measure sales performance.  A spokesman for the CFPB declined to comment. Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Most of her comments are both ill-informed and inappropriate,\u201d Sloan told reporters after speaking to the Detroit Economic Club.  Warren, long a consumer advocate, in October told Sloan she did not believe the bank would be able to change with him in charge, in remarks during his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.  Warren\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sloan\u2019s remarks.  Sloan, who took over when former CEO John Stumpf abruptly departed in October 2016, said in January that Wells Fargo was not certain it had fully uncovered and fixed all scandal-related issues.  Internal reviews and regulatory probes have revealed problems in other areas beyond the initial unauthorized accounts, including mortgage lending and auto insurance.  Earlier this month Wells Fargo said it was examining its wealth and investment management business for possible issues.  In the question-and-answer session with reporters, Sloan noted that the increase in his 2017 compensation from a year earlier in part reflected that he had been in the role for an entire year.  Regulatory filings on Wednesday showed Sloan\u2019s pay rose 35 percent from the previous year, even though he had opted out of an annual incentive plan.  \u201cI went to the board and said that I don\u2019t believe that it would be appropriate if I were paid a bonus for the year because we haven\u2019t made enough progress in terms of advancing,\u201d he said on Thursday.

The Federal Reserve in February imposed a cap on the lender\u2019s balance sheet until it improves governance, and Wells pledged a refresh of its board.  Reuters reported on Wednesday that U.S. regulators are preparing to sanction the bank for receiving commissions on auto insurance policies it helped force on drivers.","162":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Long accused of being too soft, a U.S. bank regulator has surprised its critics with tough treatment of scandal-ridden lender Wells Fargo, culminating on Thursday in more than$58 million in fines against eight former executives at the bank.  FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith  Consumer groups had worried that the Trump administration\u2019s pick to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Joseph Otting, would do little to change its reputation for leniency. A former chief executive of California\u2019s OneWest Bank, Otting as comptroller has referred to lenders as his \u201ccustomers\u201d and pursued rule changes pushed for by bank lobbyists.  But when it comes to Wells Fargo\u2019s sales practices, Otting has consistently been a harsh critic, driving penalties against the bank which have broken new ground. One person with knowledge of the matter said Wells Fargo\u2019s failure to swiftly fix systemic misconduct has angered Otting, precisely because he spent decades as a banker and felt he was held to high standards.  \u201cYou would get far more significant penalties from someone who has been in the business and is disappointed in what Wells Fargo has done,\u201d said Thomas Vartanian, a law professor at George Mason University and former OCC official.  On Thursday, the OCC banned former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf from the banking industry and fined him $17.5 million to settle charges he failed to put a stop to sales misconduct - the most it has ever secured from an individual. Among other former executives charged was retail banking head Carrie Tolstedt, who has not yet settled and is potentially facing a whopping $25 million penalty.  After watchdogs including the OCC failed to charge senior Wall Street executives for their role in the 2007-2009 financial crisis, lawmakers have pressed them to hold more individuals responsible for corporate wrongdoing. Proving personal culpability, though, is legally tough, which makes Thursday\u2019s charges all the more striking.  \u201cThe OCC actions are eye-popping in terms of the number and seniority of the individuals charged,\u201d said Erik Gerding, a law professor at the University of Colorado, adding there had not been such a high profile executive crackdown in recent memory.  Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at George Washington University, said he was \u201csurprised\u201d the OCC had pursued such drastic charges. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say they\u2019ve always been viewed as probably the most bank-friendly regulator,\u201d he added.  On Thursday, Otting said in a statement that the charges \u201creinforce the agency\u2019s expectations that management and employees ... provide fair access to financial services, treat customers fairly and comply with applicable laws.\u201d  \u201cLOW BAR\u201d  In addition to Thursday\u2019s charges, the OCC fined Wells Fargo $500 million in 2018 for product mis-selling, only the second time it has dished out a penalty of that size.  That settlement requires the bank to make extensive fixes and to repay harmed customers, an effort the OCC has been monitoring closely. It also imposed novel restrictions on the bank by giving the OCC the right to remove current executives and to vet new ones.  Otting\u2019s frustration with Wells Fargo\u2019s slow progress on its remediation effort was laid bare in March last year. Then-CEO Tim Sloan had just finished telling Congress the bank was back on track, when the OCC responded with a rare public rebuke saying it continued to be \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the bank.  The comptroller\u2019s public loss of confidence in Sloan contributed to his abrupt departure later that month, Reuters reported at the time.  Wells Fargo has said repeatedly it was making every effort to fix its problems. On Thursday, the bank\u2019s new CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement Wells Fargo had made \u201cfundamental changes to its business model, compensation programs, leadership, and governance.\u201d  By being strict with Wells Fargo, the OCC may also be trying to shed its image as a soft touch, said Wilmarth.  \u201cYou hammer this one bank and its executives ... and when people accuse you of being bank-friendly, you say, \u2018Look how tough we were on Wells Fargo!\u2019\u201d he added.  The OCC was lambasted for missing signs of the brewing financial crisis and was again criticized for failing to catch Wells Fargo\u2019s problems in the first place. An internal OCC review found its examiners failed to follow-up on red flags, including hundreds of whistleblower complaints.  While Otting is personally aggrieved by the bank\u2019s lapses, he has also been under pressure from lawmakers to take a tough line. The pressure has come particularly from progressive U.S. senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who has voiced sometimes stinging skepticism of the agency.  \u201cNo one has been tougher on Wells Fargo than myself,\u201d Otting told Warren when defending his record before Congress in May. \u201cAt the OCC?\u201d Warren replied. \u201cThat\u2019s a low bar.\u201d","163":"A federal judge in San Francisco has dismissed parts of a lawsuit accusing Wells Fargo of denying loans based on immigration status, saying the complaint did not identify anyone denied a mortgage or auto loan because they were not a U.S. citizen.

FILE PHOTO: Wells Fargo Bank branch is seen in New York City, U.S., March 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Jeenah Moon  The news came as Wells Fargo posted its first quarterly loss since 2008 and slashed its dividend to preserve capital after performing poorly on the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress test. Rivals that reported results on Tuesday also posted big loan-loss reserves, but analysts said Wells Fargo\u2019s problems run deeper.  \u201cWe don\u2019t see anything positive from Wells Fargo to hang our hats on,\u201d David Hendler, a longtime bank analyst and founder of research firm Viola Risk Advisors, said in an interview. \u201cThe company has messed up for a generation.\u201d  Hendler pointed to what he described as problems with Wells Fargo\u2019s organizational structure and balance sheet exposures that cannot quickly be resolved.  Shares were down 4.8% at $24.19.  Wells Fargo was once seen as the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of U.S. banks: it avoided the kind of problems that Wall Street rivals encountered during the 2007-2009 financial crisis and investors viewed its management team as a crew of wholesome, if profit-driven, traditional bankers.  But that perception has been upended since 2016, when the bank entered a settlement with regulators that detailed millions of phony accounts employees had created in customers\u2019 names without their permission to hit sales targets. Since then, there have been revelations about other customer abuses, and Wells Fargo has been unable to shake the damage caused by those sales practices.  Cost-cutting goals have been a hallmark of management\u2019s promises to improve profits for investors throughout the scandal, but it has so far been difficult for Wells Fargo to achieve them.  On Tuesday, Chief Executive Charlie Scharf, who took over in October, said he found $10 billion to slash from annual expenses. His predecessors had focused on costs relative to revenue.  \u201cWhile our balance sheet is strong, our margins are too narrow,\u201d Scharf said on a call with analysts. \u201cWe need to begin to take action to improve our results.\u201d  Layoffs, branch closures and cuts to third-party spending are on the table, executives said.  The San Francisco-based bank also announced it would slash its dividend starting in the third quarter, to 10 cents per share from 51 cents.  Wells Fargo reported a net loss of $2.4 billion, or 66 cents per share, compared with a profit of $6.2 billion, or $1.30 per share, in the year-earlier period.  It underperformed expectations by a mile: analysts had expected a loss of 20 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.  The main factors weighing on results were $9.5 billion loan-loss reserves and a $1.2 billion loss tied to the sales scandal. Total non-interest expenses jumped 8% to $14.6 billion.  Because Wells does not have a large capital markets business like JPMorgan Chase & Co or Bank of America Corp, its Main Street lending woes are even more painful.  It is also constrained by a growth restriction the Fed placed on its balance sheet as punishment for the sales abuses. Only when the management team can prove they have sufficiently improved risk management and controls will the regulator lift that penalty.  \u201cThis will be the toughest quarter for the banking industry since the financial crisis in 2008,\u201d said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders. \u201cWells\u2019 results will be the worst of the bunch as the Fed\u2019s asset cap makes an already challenging environment even more difficult.\u201d","168":"(Adds Moskovitz\u2019s full job title in paragraph 4)  WASHINGTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Tired of being cast as the poster child for big banks behaving badly, Wells Fargo & Co has been expanding its presence in the nation\u2019s capital to convince lawmakers it has changed and talking up its charitable work in their districts.  In the past the bank\u2019s lobbying efforts had been modest, but over the past 18 months, Wells Fargo has added more than 15 people to its Washington team, tripling its size, and is still hiring. The bank has also contracted big-name firms including Ogilvy and Federal Street Strategies, whose principals previously worked for powerful lawmakers, financial regulators or President Donald Trump, according to interviews and filings reviewed by Reuters.  Wells Fargo has also been highlighting millions of dollars spent on programs dedicated to homelessness, housing for veterans and financial literacy in key lawmakers\u2019 districts to win back their favor, bank representatives said.  \u201cWe have a lot of projects in a lot of communities that we are proud of, and we do have those conversations with elected officials,\u201d David Moskowitz, head of government relations and public policy at the fourth-largest U.S. lender, told Reuters. \u201cOur plan is to engage with virtually everyone on Capitol Hill on both sides of the aisle.\u201d  Moskowitz said he expected his team to meet with important government officials or staff almost every day.  Wells Fargo launched its charm offensive to limit the blowback from a sales scandal that erupted in September 2016, with revelations that employees opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers\u2019 names without their permission. The bank has disclosed other problems since then, including enrolling hundreds of thousands of customers in costly products such as auto insurance, that they did not need or want.  In an unprecedented move in February, the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed an asset cap on Wells Fargo. In April, two U.S. regulators jointly fined the bank $1 billion for mistreating auto borrowers. Authorities including the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Labor are still conducting their own probes.  WHIPPING BOY  Each negative headline about Wells Fargo extends how long the bank will remain in the regulatory doghouse, said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based Compass Point Research & Trading.  \u201cThere\u2019s a belief among some policymakers that Wells Fargo wants to right the ship and that it will take time to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the meantime they will remain the rhetorical whipping boy for lingering populist anger.\u201d  The scandal-related fallout has started to hit Wells Fargo\u2019s profits as it needs to work harder to win new customers and additional marketing costs keep expenses high. In the first half of the year, Wells Fargo earned $10.3 billion, 10 percent less than a year earlier. Its full-year profits before taxes are expected to be 5 percent lower, according to Refinitiv.  The bank\u2019s Washington team is trying to shift the conversation to what the bank is doing now for communities and away from the misdeeds of the past. Success could mean fewer negative headlines and a looser regulatory leash.  In interviews, Wells Fargo representatives said they had been telling lawmakers what the bank is doing to remedy customer abuses and prevent them from happening again. They also offer up the bank\u2019s expertise on lending and economic trends, tout the number of people Wells Fargo employs in lawmakers\u2019 districts and outline philanthropic programs that appeal to them.  For instance, Wells Fargo said it has provided $11.3 million in down payment help to homeowners in Los Angeles, which is represented in part by Democrat Maxine Waters.  Waters is positioned to chair the House Financial Services Committee if Democrats take control of that chamber in the Nov. 6 mid-term election and has been one of Wells Fargo\u2019s harshest critics in Congress.  She has said expanding access to affordable housing would be a top priority as committee chair. Wells also says it has donated over $10 million to various nonprofits in Waters\u2019 district over the last two years.  Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan has asked Waters for a meeting, her representative said, and bank representatives met with her staff in July.  \u201cShe looks forward to meeting with him once their schedules align,\u201d said Charla Ouertatani, staff director for Waters on the House Financial Services Committee.  Wells Fargo also donated $3.3 million last year to nonprofits and schools around Baltimore represented by Democrat Elijah Cummings tipped to chair the House Oversight Committee, if his party wins.  \u201cThere are many exceptional organizations that are transforming lives in Baltimore and throughout Maryland with limited resources,\u201d Cummings said in a statement. \u201cWhenever Wells Fargo or any company chooses to assist their efforts, I applaud that decision.\u201d  If Democrats take control of the House, Waters and Cummings would enjoy broad authority to examine Wells\u2019s business operations, as well as demand bank executives testify on past wrongdoing if they saw fit.  Wells Fargo said the bank had also donated $4.5 million to nonprofits across Iowa in 2017, a fact it highlights to the state\u2019s mostly Republican lawmakers, including Senator Chuck Grassley, who chairs the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee.  LONG PATH  In total, Wells Fargo has pledged to give away $400 million to charitable causes in 2018, and 2 percent of after-tax profits in following years. That could position it as the top corporate cash donor in the United States, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which tracks corporate giving. The bank was the top donor among financial firms in 2017 and the second-largest among corporations. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2QJzGJr)  In 2015, prior to the sales scandal, the bank donated $281 million, though Wells credits tax cuts implemented at the start of this year for part of this year\u2019s increase.  Even with those good deeds in hand, Wells Fargo will probably remain in the political crosshairs for some time, according to analysts and congressional staff.  On Oct. 4, Senate Banking Committee Democrats called for Sloan and Wells Fargo Chair Elizabeth Duke to testify about \u201cwidespread and persistent failures at the bank.\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s plan to cut its workforce by up to 10 percent is also attracting ire from Democrats.  The bank has to make up ground with regulators too. Last week, Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting told lawmakers he was \u201cnot comfortable\u201d with the bank\u2019s efforts to make things right with 600,000 auto loan borrowers. During the hearing, Hawaii Democrat Brian Schatz characterized the bank as \u201cbeyond repair.\u201d  Wells\u2019s efforts have been noticed, but the reception has been mixed, according to members of Congress and staff interviewed by Reuters.  While some say the bank is taking the right steps on a long path to a repaired reputation, distrust of banks stills runs deep, particularly among Democrats. Some lawmakers, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, have said the bank is still not doing enough to right past wrongs.  Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, said Wells Fargo has a lot more work to do before lawmakers will take its efforts seriously.  \u201cTrust is a tricky thing,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a lot easier to lose it than it is to gain it.\u201d","169":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co executives were warned that an auto insurance plan could be overcharging customers four years before the bank scrapped the program, according to a complaint released by a judge this week.

Strother, Julian and other executives named in the lawsuit could not immediately be reached for comment. Last month, regulators warned Julian and another bank official that they could face sanctions for their past work with Wells Fargo.  Wells Fargo ended its auto insurance program in September 2016 after an internal review found many customers were being wrongfully placed in a costly product they did not need.  The bank had a right to force auto borrowers into the product called \u2018collateral protection insurance\u2019 (CPI) if they let their own policies lapse. But ultimately, the bank said some 600,000 customers were forced into CPI unnecessarily when it reached a $1 billion regulatory settlement in April.  Wells Fargo initially estimated remediation efforts would cost $64 million, but that figure has since swelled as it determined more borrowers were owed greater amounts. In the third quarter, Wells Fargo set aside $241 million for those affected customers.  Its auto insurance abuses are part of a broader scandal over Wells Fargo\u2019s treatment of customers. The bank revealed over two years ago that it opened millions of phony accounts in customers\u2019 names without their permission to hit sales targets.  The San Francisco-based lender has since found sales abuses in businesses ranging from mortgage loans to wealth management.  The lawsuit was originally filed in U.S. District Court, Central District of California, in August. Wells Fargo has fought to keep some details of the case under seal.  The plaintiffs say they are customers seeking reimbursement for wrongful charges, and allege Wells Fargo pushed drivers with poor credit into policies more often than well-off customers.  Wells Fargo was 10 times more likely to force borrowers with damaged credit into CPI insurance than those with high credit scores, according to the lawsuit, which cites an internal bank presentation.  Drivers of Tesla vehicles and others who carried high loan balances were exempted from CPI, according to the lawsuit.","170":"FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Company said on Tuesday the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) had terminated a 2015 consent order related to an anti-money laundering compliance program after the bank took steps to remedy the problems.  The end of the consent order is a positive sign for the bank, which has been trying to repair its frayed relationship with regulators, particularly the OCC, which has taken a tough line on the fourth-largest lender in the United States.  Wells Fargo is still working on a separate 2018 sweeping OCC consent order related to the mis-selling of mortgage and auto-insurance products, which imposes a number of constraints on the bank\u2019s business.  The anti-money laundering consent order terminated on Tuesday required the bank to implement customer due diligence standards, which included the collection of current beneficial ownership information for certain business customers.  Wells Fargo said on Tuesday it had undertaken significant work to enhance its bank secrecy act\/anti-money laundering (BSA\/AML) compliance program.  The end of the consent order provides new Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf momentum going into the January earnings call, where he plans to unveil his vision to reshape the scandal-plagued bank.

He targeted $10 billion in savings annually over the long term, but investors are growing impatient.  \u201cWhy is that the number?\u201d asked UBS analyst Saul Martinez about Wells\u2019 core cost guidance. \u201cBecause you haven\u2019t been anywhere near that number for five years.\u201d  The San Francisco-based bank, which has been in regulators\u2019 penalty box since 2016, spent $961 million on customer remediation accruals in the quarter, indicating that the bank was still feeling the burn from its sales practice scandal has already cost it billions.  Bank executives have signaled repeatedly that the worst of the fallout is in the past, but elevated operating losses have remained constant. Wells Fargo has reported large litigation or remediation charges in 7 of the last 11 quarters, according to filings.  Outgoing Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry made the same assurance last quarter.  \u201cThat is what I said and I was wrong when I said it,\u201d Shrewsberry told reporters on a call discussing results, adding that he still felt confident lumpy costs were in the past. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if people waited until the end of the next quarter to make sure that we lived up to that.\u201d  Cost-cutting initiatives are under way as Scharf begins implementing changes across the bank. Headcount fell by more than 1,000 from the prior quarter. But firm-wide expenses inched up slightly due to scandal-related operating losses and a $718 million restructuring charges tied to severance.  LOAN WEAKNESS  Rising costs, however, do not help as the banking industry deals with near-zero interest rates and slower loan growth.  Net-interest income at the fourth-largest U.S. bank was $9.4 billion, down $512 million from the second quarter, as its loan book shrank 2%. Total revenue fell 14%.  Because Wells does not have a large capital markets business like JPMorgan Chase JPM.N or Citigroup Inc C.N, it has fewer ways to cushion declines in revenue from low interest rates.  Banking rivals including Bank of America Corp BAC.N have also said net interest income should start to recover after the third quarter as loan demand picks back up. But Wells Fargo offered a more bearish outlook for its own revenue due to a growth restriction on its balance sheet imposed by regulators after the scandal.  \u201cWe won\u2019t be expanding the size of our balance sheet, really much for any reason because we\u2019re operating under an asset cap,\u201d Shrewsberry said. \u201cWe\u2019re not at it but we\u2019re pretty close.\u201d  The U.S. Federal Reserve capped Wells Fargo\u2019s assets at $1.95 trillion in February of 2018 until the proves it fixed the risk management failures that led to widespread customer abuses. The bank has not given guidance on when it expects the cap to be lifted.  Total period-end loans fell nearly 4% to $920.1 billion, hurt by a $30 billion fall in commercial loans, a bigger slump than expected, Jefferies analysts said.  The U.S. Federal Reserve placed restriction\u2019s on Wells\u2019 balance sheet as punishment for the sales abuses, to be lifted only when the management team can prove they have sufficiently improved risk management and controls.  Wells Fargo posted net income applicable to common stock of $1.72 billion, or 42 cents per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $4.04 billion, or 92 cents a year earlier.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo branch is seen in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, U.S. February 10, 2015. REUTERS\/Jim Young\/File Photo  In July, Wells Fargo blamed a third-party vendor for wrongly layering insurance policies on its auto borrowers. Wells Fargo did not explain that it received payouts when those policies were written.  The fact that Wells Fargo stood to profit from the insurance program will form the backbone of fresh sanctions against the bank, said people with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.  Those penalties would be the latest in a long-running scandal over how the nation\u2019s third-largest lender treated its customers.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Wells Fargo\u2019s primary regulator, is asking the bank which executives knew about the payments and whether they should have been stopped sooner, said the sources.  Wells Fargo does not comment on regulatory matters, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Catherine Pulley said. The bank received commissions from insurance partners in a program ended in 2013, she said.  \u201cWe are sorry for any harm caused and are focused on the important work to complete our remediation process,\u201d said Pulley.  Wells Fargo\u2019s auto insurance woes stem from a policy drivers must carry when they borrow money to buy a new car. It pays out to the bank when a car is stolen or destroyed.  Wells Fargo required drivers to carry their own policies, but had a right to \u201cforce-place\u201d a policy on borrowers who let insurance lapse. Insurers working for Wells Fargo pushed policies onto 570,000 customers who already had coverage and then delivered profits for the bank.  Wells is investigating auto insurance abuses back to 2005 and estimates it will need to refund $145 million to borrowers, and adjust account balances by another $37 million, according to securities filings. That is up from its initial cost estimate of $80 million.  In September 2016, the OCC joined other regulators in ordering Wells Fargo to pay $190 million after its employees created phony customer accounts to artificially boost sales figures. That settlement launched more than a year of official scrutiny and revelations of other customer abuses.  A top regulator for personal finance, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), was ready to sue Wells Fargo over improper mortgage fees last year but the agency\u2019s current chief put the lawsuit on hold, Reuters previously reported.  A settlement over auto insurance abuse would likely be another joint action among regulators, said people familiar with the probe. The CFPB\u2019s mortgage case could be folded into that joint action and the resolution will likely involve financial penalties though the amount has not been settled, they said.  The OCC does not comment on supervisory matters, spokesman Bryan Hubbard said. A CFPB official declined to comment for this story.  In explaining the problems with auto insurance last year, Wells blamed the issue on an unnamed third-party vendor that mistakenly believed those borrowers\u2019 insurance had lapsed.  \u201cWe had a vendor that was providing insurance,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan told investors in September. \u201cWe should have caught that and we should have dealt with it.\u201d  National General, an insurance company, has monitored the \"force-placed\" coverage for Wells Fargo since 2015, the bank has said. Previously, the program was run by companies including QBE Insurance Group Ltd, Bank of America Corp BAC.N and defunct Countrywide Financial.  In 2014, Wells Fargo agreed to pay mortgage borrowers who were wrongly pushed into extra flood and wind protection. QBE Insurance managed the bank\u2019s force-placed insurance program at the time and was part of the settlement.","181":"WASHINGTON\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are investigating the former head of Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s community banking division for her role in the lender\u2019s product mis-selling scandal, two sources said.  The Department of Justice is investigating Carrie Tolstedt, who ran the bank\u2019s retail and small business lending business from 2007 to 2016, the sources said. The criminal inquiry into Tolstedt\u2019s actions has not been previously reported.  The development marks a rare instance of a senior bank executive facing criminal inquiry as a result of their job. Wells Fargo, which paid $3 billion in February to settle federal civil and criminal probes, has admitted that it pressured employees between 2002 and 2016 to meet unrealistic sales goals, which led them to open fake accounts for customers.  Reuters was unable to determine whether the criminal investigation will lead to any charges against Tolstedt. Tolstedt is also contesting a $25 million fine and civil charges brought by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a banking regulator in January.  Tolstedt and Enu Mainigi, Tolstedt\u2019s counsel at Williams & Connolly LLP, did not respond to several requests for comment about the criminal inquiry. Mainigi has previously said that Tolstedt acted \u201cappropriately and in good faith at all times.\u201d  \u201cThroughout her career, Ms. Tolstedt acted with the utmost integrity and concern for doing the right thing,\u201d she said in January in response to the OCC\u2019s charges. \u201cA full and fair examination of the facts will vindicate Carrie.\u201d  A spokesperson for Wells Fargo declined to comment.  A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California, which has led the Department of Justice\u2019s Wells Fargo criminal investigation, declined to comment.  The prosecution of Wells Fargo executives who oversaw the bank\u2019s activities is seen by lawmakers and investors as one of the final pieces of the scandal\u2019s fallout for the bank. Wells Fargo has paid out more than $7 billion to settle multiple probes and private litigation.  Prosecutors had been probing Tolstedt as one among a short list of people with a view to bringing criminal charges, the sources said. One of the sources added that the list has narrowed to focus on Tolstedt.  Tolstedt is the individual described as \u201cExecutive A\u201d whom the Justice Department singled out in a document detailing its evidence against the San Francisco-based lender in February, one of the sources said.  In the document, a statement of facts published alongside the deal agreed by the bank and the government prosecutors, said \u201cExecutive A\u201d ran Wells Fargo\u2019s community banking division from 2007-2016 and led its strategy to sell additional products to existing customers.  \u201cExecutive A\u201d helped cultivate a high-pressure sales culture, in which \u201conerous\u201d sales goals led thousands of employees to engage in unlawful and unethical conduct, they wrote. The executive also ignored repeated complaints about the practices, prosecutors wrote.  In its charges, the OCC said Tolstedt was \u201cdirectly and significantly\u201d responsible for the business model that incentivized the misconduct. She invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in the civil inquiry, the OCC said in January.","182":"WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A U.S. bank regulator announced Thursday that several senior former Wells Fargo executives face potential lifetime industry bans and millions of dollars in civil penalties for their roles in the bank\u2019s long-running sales practices scandal.

The letter was also signed by Elizabeth Duke, a former Federal Reserve governor named chair of Wells Fargo\u2019s board last year in a broader overhaul.  The bank has already agreed to publish a business standards review, prompting shareholders led by the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia to withdraw a shareholder resolution that demanded details on the cultural and ethical causes of recent scandals.  In 2016 the bank admitted employees had opened potentially millions of sham accounts, triggering a leadership revamp. Regulatory issues have persisted, with the Fed in February capping its growth until governance and controls improve.  There are some signs investors will show patience on Tuesday. Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis recommended investors cast non-binding votes in favor of the pay of executives including Sloan, who received a package worth $17.6 million last year.  Both advisers also backed Sloan and nearly all other candidates standing for 12 seats on the board, including eight new independent directors since 2015.

DiNapoli has also sponsored a shareholder resolution calling for a report on the risks pay incentives pose to the bank. The fund has about 14 million shares of the bank, less than a third of one percent of shares outstanding.  Internally, Sloan\u2019s pay has also drawn criticism from some company employees ahead of the shareholder meeting.  The No. 3 U.S. lender by assets has announced plans to grant about 50 shares of stock to most of its roughly 265,000 employees over two years, in theory giving them more of a voice on bank decisions.  A spokeswoman said the award level \u201cwas deemed meaningful as we hope our team members will feel a sense of ownership in the progress we need to make, together.\u201d  Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco but has staged annual meetings elsewhere in recent years, including in Florida, Arizona and St. Louis.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith  Wells Fargo\u2019s ambition to become the only major U.S. bank with a female CEO underscores the need to restore its image with a wide range of constituents, including customers, shareholders, regulators and politicians, after it became mired in a scandal in 2016 for opening potentially millions of unauthorized accounts.  Former CEO Tim Sloan left abruptly last month, becoming the second CEO to leave the bank in the scandal\u2019s fallout.  The board plans to approach Citigroup Inc\u2019s Latin America chief Jane Fraser, one of the sources said. During Fraser\u2019s 15-year tenure at Citigroup, she has gained experience running consumer and commercial businesses as well as its private bank.  Fraser could not be immediately reached for comment.  The board also discussed approaching JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s Marianne Lake, but after the bank named her to run JPMorgan\u2019s consumer lending business last week, that option became less viable, the source added. The board wants someone who can convince regulators, employees, investors and customers that the bank has fixed problems underpinning the sales scandal, the sources said.  The bank\u2019s board feels that choosing a woman might please lawmakers in Washington who have been critical not only of Wells Fargo\u2019s misbehavior, but of the broader banking industry for a lack of diversity and gender equality, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  It also believes that such a move could bolster Wells Fargo\u2019s image with the households of customers where women play a leading role in managing finances, one of the sources added.  The new CEO will also have to resolve litigation and regulatory matters. There are 14 outstanding consent orders with government entities, as well as probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice.  To be sure, Spencer Stuart will approach and consider several male candidates for the CEO job as well, one of the sources said. The top priority is to find an external candidate who can navigate the bank\u2019s regulatory issues, the source added.  Finding an outsider who meets all those qualifications and wants the job will be difficult, the sources said. There are few people with the necessary experience, even fewer of those who are women, and it is not clear if any of the obvious candidates would be open to taking the role.  The sources asked not to be identified because Wells Fargo\u2019s board deliberations are confidential.  Spokespeople for Wells Fargo and Spencer Stuart declined to comment.  Wells Fargo\u2019s board has not made any public statements about its requirements for a new CEO, beyond Chair Betsy Duke saying the job should attract the \u201ctop talent in banking.\u201d  The board wants to complete the search within the next three to six months, one of the sources said.  STALLED SHARES  After Sloan\u2019s ouster, Wells Fargo\u2019s board appointed Allen Parker, who had been general counsel, as interim CEO. The board has said it is looking for an external candidate as a permanent replacement. It is not clear whether Parker will stay at the bank.  Others whose names have been mentioned by analysts, recruiters and industry sources as perspective CEO candidates include Alphabet Inc finance chief Ruth Porat and Bank of America Corp\u2019s chief technology officer Cathy Bessant.  Wells Fargo shares have stalled since Sloan\u2019s departure on March 29th, while the KBW Bank index has rallied more than 7 percent.  Wells Fargo would be \u201cthe best stock on earth to buy\u201d if it had the right CEO, said Greg Donaldson, chairman of Donaldson Capital Management in Indiana.  Donaldson held about 50,000 Wells Fargo shares, but sold the stake last year as problems mounted. The CEO change could convince him to re-invest, depending on who it is, he told Reuters.  \u201cIt would be very smart for them to get a woman,\u201d he said.","192":"FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo logo is seen at the SIBOS banking and financial conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, October 19, 2017.

The new disclosures add to Wells Fargo\u2019s numerous regulatory penalties, private lawsuits and remediation efforts. Most stem from a sales practices scandal that has touched on all of the bank\u2019s major business units.  The tax inquiries are being conducted by multiple agencies, which Wells Fargo did not name in its 10-Q filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They focus on how the bank purchased or negotiated the purchase of the credits in connection with financing of low-income housing developments.  Representatives for the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The $8 million accrual is intended for roughly 625 borrowers who should have qualified for a loan modification under a program the Treasury Department set up in 2009 to help Americans who were struggling to make mortgage payments.  An error in Wells Fargo\u2019s underwriting tool improperly excluded those borrowers, 400 of whom eventually had their homes foreclosed upon, the bank said.  The bank also updated disclosures on issues it has discovered in auto lending, wealth management, fiduciary and custody accounts, foreign exchange trading, mortgage rate-lock extensions, \u201cadd-on\u201d products like identity theft protection, and frozen or closed bank accounts.","194":"FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo branch is seen in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, U.S. February 10, 2015.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  For years, Wells CEOs spoke with Midwestern lilts and have sprinkled their public events with folksy anecdotes. John Stumpf, who ran the San Francisco-based bank from 2007 to 2016, spoke publicly about being raised on a Minnesota farm with 10 siblings, and once recounted his own experience being upside down on a mortgage during the foreclosure crisis in 2010. Tim Sloan, who took over the reins as the bank\u2019s fake accounts scandal unraveled, once brought his family, including grandchildren, on stage at a shareholder meeting in Iowa.  But Scharf is not known for such pleasantries, several analysts who have worked with him said.  He tended to give short, blunt answers when he was CEO of Visa Inc V.N and Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK.N, or when he was a senior executive at JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, they said, noting that he is not shy about showing annoyance if he does not appreciate a question or comment.  \u201cHe\u2019s not polite necessarily,\u201d said MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis, who covers Visa.  \u201cHis bedside manner needs improvement,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy, who interacted with Scharf at BNY Mellon.  \u201cHe has a straight-between-the-eyes kind of delivery,\u201d said Argus Research analyst Stephen Biggar, who has followed Scharf at each of his companies so far.  A Reuters review of a dozen transcripts for conference calls Scharf led in previous jobs offered a glimpse of his tendencies. He started sentences with phrases like, \u201cAs I\u2019ve said many times,\u201d or \u201cAs I know you already know,\u201d when he seemed to think questions were repetitive. He frequently directed analysts to do their own math, rather than offering guidance.  Wells Fargo declined to comment for this story.  Analysts who cover Wells Fargo said they will appreciate directness in a CEO, after years of feeling whipsawed by a sales scandal whose breadth and consequences have taken unexpected turns. Prior management teams initially downplayed the extent of the problems, and how they might affect profits, regulatory relationships and Wells Fargo\u2019s reputation with customers. (reut.rs\/2FEiKQW)  Although associates say Scharf can be blunt at times, they also view him as knowledgeable, honest and experienced. Some compared him to his one-time mentor, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who is known to speak his mind.

Scharf may be the first Wells Fargo CEO with more credentials on Wall Street than Main Street. In hiring him, the bank\u2019s board agreed to let the native New Yorker keep his main work location in Manhattan, though Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco, with big hubs in Minneapolis and Charlotte, North Carolina.  Analysts do not expect Scharf to give off the same vibe as his predecessors \u2014 though they said he may make an extra effort to be courteous, given the amount of attention Wells Fargo receives. In his first internal town hall as Wells Fargo CEO, Scharf painted himself as a family man.  \u201cI don\u2019t expect too much oomph,\u201d said Vining Sparks analyst Marty Mosby. \u201cI think its going to be very collegial.\u201d","201":"March 13 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co gave Chief Executive Tim Sloan a 5 percent pay raise for 2018, prompting the Federal Reserve to release a statement saying that it does not sign off on executive pay.

In 2017, Sloan did not receive a bonus and his total compensation was $17.4 million.  \u201cThe Federal Reserve does not approve pay packages. We expect boards of directors to hold management accountable,\u201d said a Fed spokesperson in an emailed statement when asked about the bank\u2019s new executive compensation numbers.  The Fed typically has been tight lipped about the institutions it regulates and rarely comments beyond pre-scheduled regulatory events.  Wells Fargo is currently prohibited from growing in size, after the Federal Reserve issued an unprecedented asset cap on it in February, citing \u201cwidespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns.\u201d  The 2016 revelation that Wells Fargo created millions of fake customer accounts prompted regulatory probes into mortgage foreclosures, auto insurance sales and its wealth management businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines.  Wells Fargo released its compensation one day after Sloan appeared before the House Financial Services Committee to prove to lawmakers that the bank was reformed since 2016 revelations that it created millions of unauthorized customer accounts.  At Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Sloan was peppered with bipartisan criticism for four hours but he navigated a hostile committee without a major stumble.

The board said in a statement it concluded it was best to seek an outside candidate to replace Sloan. The bank\u2019s general counsel, C. Allen Parker, one of the few newcomers in the bank\u2019s top ranks, will serve as interim chief executive.  The move amounted to an admission that the board erred three years ago by appointing another insider after the previous CEO, John Stumpf, resigned following revelations that Wells Fargo had opened potentially millions of unauthorized consumer accounts. Prior to becoming CEO, Sloan served as chief operating officer and head of the wholesale bank.  In a Thursday conference call, Sloan, 58, said he decided to leave because the focus on him had become a distraction inhibiting the bank from moving forward.  \u201cI want to assure all of our stakeholders that this was my decision and is not related to our first-quarter financial performance, the long-term outlook for the company or any newly discovered issues,\u201d he said.  On the call, analysts tried unsuccessfully to get a direct answer to whether regulators had given Sloan the final push, or even whether the bank had been surprised by the most recent criticism from the Comptroller of the Currency.  Board Chair Betsy Duke declined to say what qualifications directors want in the next CEO, including whether they will insist on having an executive with banking industry experience. She said the person will be someone who really wants \u201cthe challenge and the opportunity...That is the person we want.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  She added the bank has not yet spoken with anyone regarding the CEO position, and the search committee will meet for the first time on Friday. As recently as a week ago, the board had reiterated its unanimous support for Sloan.  Critics had accused Sloan, who was part of the management team while the wrongdoing was happening, of being too entrenched in Wells Fargo\u2019s culture to change it, even as the bank tried to do just that and move past its scandals.  In March 2018, the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed an unprecedented asset cap on Wells Fargo, barring it from growing its balance sheet until it improved risk management controls. Wells Fargo has said it expects to operate under the cap for the remainder of the year.  It is not yet clear what was the final straw for Sloan. However, the banks primary regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, criticized the bank in recent weeks. \u201cWhat happened at Wells Fargo really was a remarkably widespread series of breakdowns really in their risk management apparatus,\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said.  The Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency both declined to comment on Sloan\u2019s departure.  As Wells Fargo tried to move on, it got rid of the lofty sales incentives that led to the fake accounts and repaid millions to customers who were improperly charged fees. But reputational issues continued to hang over the bank as it racked up billions in settlements and fines.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Wells Fargo has long prided itself on its homegrown culture. But the bank\u2019s insularity proved burdensome in recovering from the scandal.  \u201cThe best thing he (Sloan) could do for the company was to retire. In the long run, it is the right move,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy said.  Sloan had become a perpetual target for politicians who repeatedly called for his removal. U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown recently called for his resignation. Earlier this month, he was grilled by the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.  Parker, the interim head, joined Wells Fargo from an outside law firm as general counsel in March 2017 to help turn around the bank. At the time he was the only one of 11 top executives who had not been at the bank during the scandal.  Parker will receive an annual base salary of $2 million, according to filings. Sloan\u2019s departure came two weeks before the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets was due to report first-quarter results and a month before its annual shareholder meeting. In 2016, the bank agreed to pay $185 million to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies, the largest fine of its kind, to settle a sales practice scandal in its consumer retail bank. Two weeks ago, the bank said Sloan received a 5 percent pay raise for 2018, with base salary of $2.4 million, $14 million in stock awards and a $2 million bonus based on the bank\u2019s financial performance.  The bank said in a filing that Sloan will not receive any additional compensation for his sudden exit, though he still stands to earn millions in stock awards as part of the company\u2019s retirement plan.","210":"March 20 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co:  * WELLS FARGO ANNOUNCES AID FOR CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY COVID-19  * TEMPORARILY CLOSING SOME BRANCHES, ADJUSTING OPERATING HOURS OF BRANCHES, RELOCATING EMPLOYEES TO BUSIER BRANCHES  * RESPONSE INCLUDES SUSPENDING RESIDENTIAL FORECLOSURE SALES, FEE WAIVERS, ACCELERATION OF $175 MILLION IN DONATIONS TO HELP MOST VULNERABLE  * COMPANY HAS SUSPENDED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY FORECLOSURE SALES, EVICTIONS AND INVOLUNTARY AUTO REPOSSESSIONS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","211":"FILE PHOTO: A woman walks by a Wells Fargo bank branch in Washington, DC, U.S., October 8, 2018.

Tim\u2019s time with the company is an advantage,\u201d a comment that received louder applause than Chiang received.  Speaking before the meeting, individual investor Cherie Mortice of Des Moines said she voted for Sloan and other directors, saying it was worth giving the bank a chance to recover.  \u201cI think he\u2019s kind of hoping to restore trust. I\u2019m really hopeful,\u201d she said.  None of three shareholder measures on the bank\u2019s proxy received a majority of support, bank executives said.  The event came days after Wells Fargo said it would pay regulators $1 billion to settle matters related to mortgage and auto lending abuses.  About 100 protesters marched into the lobby of the hotel before the meeting, holding signs for various causes.  In 2016 the bank admitted employees had opened potentially millions of sham accounts, triggering a leadership revamp.  The Federal Reserve in February ordered Wells Fargo to halt growth until governance and controls improve.  Wells Fargo, though based in San Francisco, has held the meeting in other locations in recent years.  Tuesday\u2019s meeting at moments laid bare divisions in Iowa over one of the state\u2019s largest private employers. State leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver, a Republican, spoke to welcome executives.  Others questioned whether Sloan and others were right for the task of reform.  \u201cIf I ran my farm the way Wells Fargo ran their business, I\u2019d be kicked out of Marshall County. I\u2019d be a failure,\u201d said one speaker, who identified himself as a retired Iowa farmer.  Wells Fargo\u2019s home mortgage and home equity businesses have about 14,500 workers in and around Des Moines.

A Wells Fargo spokeswoman confirmed the contents of the memo.

Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, has been quietly winding down its relationship with the NRA for nearly two years, a bank spokesman said. But Tuesday\u2019s comments marked a change in tone at the San Francisco-based lender, which has been known as one of the largest financiers of the firearms sector, even as other large bank rivals backed away.  Past Wells Fargo executives defended the bank\u2019s relationship with the NRA and lending policies, saying that gun violence solutions should come from the government not banks.  Wells Fargo\u2019s continued relationship with the organization after 2018 caused it to lose its mortgage partnership with the American Federation of Teachers, a major U.S. union.  Major finance firms including Bank of America Corp BAC.N and Citigroup Inc C.N placed limits on their lending to gun makers and retailers in 2018 in response to a widespread backlash after a school shooting in Florida.

The bank\u2019s operating committee decided this week on the tentative date, he added.  Roughly 200,000 of the San Francisco-based bank\u2019s 265,000 employees have been working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic. Those still reporting to the office primarily include employees working from bank branches or operations centers.  The bank had already cautioned workers that its coronavirus-related policies would likely stay in place even after governments loosen lockdowns. States including Georgia and Texas have started non-essential businesses, and hard-hit New York is preparing to ease business restrictions in some regions as soon as this week.  Before July, Wells Fargo executives may consider minor changes to current policies, like allowing customers to use teller windows at branches that have been converted to drive-through only during the pandemic, or resuming some operations in other countries where conditions have eased, the memo said.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo ATM machine is shown in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  In a bid to cut costs to offset higher regulatory spending, Wells Fargo gathered about 14 of its IT vendors in Charlotte in July and asked for a rebate for 2018. In doing so, the bank claimed the vendors had benefited from increased business from its various scandals.  Many vendors felt compelled to pay up out of fear they may lose out on future business from the Wall Street giant.  Wells Fargo spokesman Peter Gilchrist said participation in the voluntary rebate would not be considered when awarding future contacts. \u201cWells Fargo\u2019s investment in technology remains a strong priority, and we value the strategic relationships we have with our vendors.\u201d  Still, many vendors feared not fulfilling the refund request would make their firms less competitive as Wells Fargo scales back its use of outside contractors. The bank is expected to issue a new request for business proposals from its IT vendors in the first quarter of next year.  The San Francisco-based bank has leaned on cost cuts in recent years as the fallout from a wide-ranging sales practices scandal has stunted revenue growth. However, increased spending on headcount and technology to satisfy regulators has caused the bank to back away from its expense targets.  Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry recently pointed to professional services, or work by consultants, as a expense line that analysts and investors can expect to be reduced in the next quarter. Costs attributed to outside professional services and data processing declined 17% last year.  In 2018, the bank spent $660 million on outside data processing, according to financial filings. If the bank recouped 2.5% of that cost, or $16.5 million, it would only make a small dent in its $56 billion annual budget. But for smaller IT firms like Richmond, Virginia-based Apex Systems, giving a 2.5% refund to a large client like Wells Fargo could mean paying employees less or taking a hit to earnings.  A Wells Fargo representative urged vendors not to pass on the expense to employees in the form of pay cuts, according to an email exchange viewed by Reuters.  Some of Well Fargo\u2019s IT vendors have already paid the 2018 rebate in full while others have asked to pay by installments, according to the sources familiar with the situation.  But the sources, who requested anonymity since the matter is private, said at least two vendors have refused to pay the rebate as a matter of principle.  \u201cThey\u2019re just expecting to unfortunately have the relationship end,\u201d one of the sources said.","239":"An Illinois man who says he was denied an auto loan from Wells Fargo because he is in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has filed a proposed class action against the bank alleging discriminatory loan practices.

A lady walks by a Wells Fargo bank branch in Washington, DC, U.S., October 8, 2018. REUTERS\/Pete Schroeder  In the past the bank\u2019s lobbying efforts had been modest, but over the past 18 months, Wells Fargo has added more than 15 people to its Washington team, tripling its size, and is still hiring. The bank has also contracted big-name firms including Ogilvy and Federal Street Strategies, whose principals previously worked for powerful lawmakers, financial regulators or President Donald Trump, according to interviews and filings reviewed by Reuters.  Wells Fargo has also been highlighting millions of dollars spent on programs dedicated to homelessness, housing for veterans and financial literacy in key lawmakers\u2019 districts to win back their favor, bank representatives said.  \u201cWe have a lot of projects in a lot of communities that we are proud of, and we do have those conversations with elected officials,\u201d David Moskowitz, head of government relations and public policy at the fourth-largest U.S. lender, told Reuters. \u201cOur plan is to engage with virtually everyone on Capitol Hill on both sides of the aisle.\u201d  Moskowitz said he expected his team to meet with important government officials or staff almost every day.  Wells Fargo launched its charm offensive to limit the blowback from a sales scandal that erupted in September 2016, with revelations that employees opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers\u2019 names without their permission. The bank has disclosed other problems since then, including enrolling hundreds of thousands of customers in costly products such as auto insurance, that they did not need or want.  In an unprecedented move in February, the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed an asset cap on Wells Fargo. In April, two U.S. regulators jointly fined the bank $1 billion for mistreating auto borrowers. Authorities including the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Labor are still conducting their own probes.  WHIPPING BOY  Each negative headline about Wells Fargo extends how long the bank will remain in the regulatory doghouse, said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based Compass Point Research & Trading.  \u201cThere\u2019s a belief among some policymakers that Wells Fargo wants to right the ship and that it will take time to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the meantime they will remain the rhetorical whipping boy for lingering populist anger.\u201d  The scandal-related fallout has started to hit Wells Fargo\u2019s profits as it needs to work harder to win new customers and additional marketing costs keep expenses high. In the first half of the year, Wells Fargo earned $10.3 billion, 10 percent less than a year earlier. Its full-year profits before taxes are expected to be 5 percent lower, according to Refinitiv.  The bank\u2019s Washington team is trying to shift the conversation to what the bank is doing now for communities and away from the misdeeds of the past. Success could mean fewer negative headlines and a looser regulatory leash.  In interviews, Wells Fargo representatives said they had been telling lawmakers what the bank is doing to remedy customer abuses and prevent them from happening again. They also offer up the bank\u2019s expertise on lending and economic trends, tout the number of people Wells Fargo employs in lawmakers\u2019 districts and outline philanthropic programs that appeal to them.  For instance, Wells Fargo said it has provided $11.3 million in down payment help to homeowners in Los Angeles, which is represented in part by Democrat Maxine Waters.  Waters is positioned to chair the House Financial Services Committee if Democrats take control of that chamber in the Nov. 6 mid-term election and has been one of Wells Fargo\u2019s harshest critics in Congress.  She has said expanding access to affordable housing would be a top priority as committee chair. Wells also says it has donated over $10 million to various nonprofits in Waters\u2019 district over the last two years.  Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan has asked Waters for a meeting, her representative said, and bank representatives met with her staff in July.  \u201cShe looks forward to meeting with him once their schedules align,\u201d said Charla Ouertatani, staff director for Waters on the House Financial Services Committee.  The committee plans to revisit Wells Fargo\u2019s treatment of customers and its compliance with consumer protection laws after the election, she said.  Wells Fargo also donated $3.3 million last year to nonprofits and schools around Baltimore represented by Democrat Elijah Cummings tipped to chair the House Oversight Committee, if his party wins.  \u201cThere are many exceptional organizations that are transforming lives in Baltimore and throughout Maryland with limited resources,\u201d Cummings said in a statement. \u201cWhenever Wells Fargo or any company chooses to assist their efforts, I applaud that decision.\u201d  If Democrats take control of the House, Waters and Cummings would enjoy broad authority to examine Wells\u2019s business operations, as well as demand bank executives testify on past wrongdoing if they saw fit.  Wells Fargo said the bank had also donated $4.5 million to nonprofits across Iowa in 2017, a fact it highlights to the state\u2019s mostly Republican lawmakers, including Senator Chuck Grassley, who chairs the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee.  LONG PATH  In total, Wells Fargo has pledged to give away $400 million to charitable causes in 2018, and 2 percent of after-tax profits in following years. That could position it as the top corporate cash donor in the United States, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which tracks corporate giving. The bank was the top donor among financial firms in 2017 and the second-largest among corporations. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2QJzGJr)  In 2015, prior to the sales scandal, the bank donated $281 million, though Wells credits tax cuts implemented at the start of this year for part of this year\u2019s increase.  Even with those good deeds in hand, Wells Fargo will probably remain in the political crosshairs for some time, according to analysts and congressional staff.  On Oct. 4, Senate Banking Committee Democrats called for Sloan and Wells Fargo Chair Elizabeth Duke to testify about \u201cwidespread and persistent failures at the bank.\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s plan to cut its workforce by up to 10 percent is also attracting ire from Democrats.  The bank has to make up ground with regulators too. Last week, Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting told lawmakers he was \u201cnot comfortable\u201d with the bank\u2019s efforts to make things right with 600,000 auto loan borrowers. During the hearing, Hawaii Democrat Brian Schatz characterized the bank as \u201cbeyond repair.\u201d  Wells\u2019s efforts have been noticed, but the reception has been mixed, according to members of Congress and staff interviewed by Reuters.  While some say the bank is taking the right steps on a long path to a repaired reputation, distrust of banks stills runs deep, particularly among Democrats. Some lawmakers, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, have said the bank is still not doing enough to right past wrongs.  Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, said Wells Fargo has a lot more work to do before lawmakers will take its efforts seriously.  \u201cTrust is a tricky thing,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a lot easier to lose it than it is to gain it.\u201d","246":"FILE PHOTO: A sign outside the headquarters of JP Morgan Chase & Co in New York, September 19, 2013.

It said it identified at least 101 potentially unsuitable switches, including a customer who incurred $14,037 in fees and charges when surrendering a $180,500 annuity.  The payout by Wells Fargo Clearing Services and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network includes $1.45 million in restitution and $675,000 in civil fines.  Neither entity admitted or denied wrongdoing. Both have taken steps to improve supervision, including developing a \u201cswitch alert\u201d for when customers move money.  FINRA said the wrongdoing occurred from January 2011 to August 2016, the month before Wells Fargo became enmeshed in a series of scandals over its treatment of customers, including the opening of accounts without their knowledge.","255":"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co will pay customers at least $386 million to settle class-action claims that the bank signed them up for auto insurance they did not want or need when they took out car loans.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  In a letter to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, Warren said Sloan, a 30-year veteran of Wells, was \u201cdeeply implicated\u201d in prior bank misconduct and it was untenable for him to remain at the bank as the Fed sought a drastic overhaul of its operations.  \u201cThe Wells Fargo Board of Directors cannot plausibly claim that it is \u2018ensuring senior management\u2019s ongoing effectiveness in managing the firm\u2019s activities\u2019 while retaining a CEO that helped oversee this much misconduct,\u201d she wrote.  The Fed took the unprecedented step of ordering the bank to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion in February, saying Wells Fargo had prioritized growth at the expense of proper compliance and risk management. The bank now must convince the Fed it has sufficiently overhauled its policies before it is permitted to grow.  Warren has called for Sloan\u2019s removal in the past, but she cannot compel the U.S. central bank to take such a step. Still, her letter indicated she was ramping up her efforts to oust Sloan, and it marks the latest challenge for the bank in Washington, where Wells Fargo has been working to move past its scandals and rebuild its reputation.  Wells Fargo is confident in the steps it has taken so far to satisfy the consent order and is engaged in constructive dialogue with the Fed, spokeswoman Erika Reynoso said in response to questions about the letter.  A Fed spokesman said the agency had received the letter and would respond.  Sloan told analysts during a conference call on Friday that the bank continues to expect the asset cap to be lifted in the first half of next year.  Wells Fargo has been coping with a series of scandals since 2016, when it was reported that employees had opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers\u2019 names without their permission. The bank has disclosed other problems since then, including enrolling hundreds of thousands of customers in costly products, such as auto insurance, that they did not need or want.  Since Sloan took over as CEO in 2016, analysts and investors have repeatedly questioned whether he was the right person to turn around the bank. Wells\u2019s board has defended its pick, saying Sloan\u2019s deep knowledge of the bank was an asset.  Most recently, the bank's chair, Betsy Duke, shot down rumors that the board was seeking to replace Sloan with former Goldman Sachs Group GS.N executive and Trump adviser Gary Cohn.  \u201cCEO Tim Sloan has the unanimous support of the board, and this support has never wavered,\u201d she said in a statement at the time.  Financial analysts do not expect Warren\u2019s letter to carry much weight with the Fed or with Wells Fargo\u2019s board, but the Fed has given in to Warren\u2019s pressure once before. In May, the Fed said it would hold a public vote on whether to lift growth restrictions on Wells Fargo, after being urged to do so by the Democratic senator.  \u201cI don\u2019t think that political pressure is going to sway the Fed either way,\u201d said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders, noting that President Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of rising interest rates have not deterred the regulator from implementing more hikes.","258":"A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017.

Julian joined Wells through its merger with Wachovia Corp and has served as chief auditor since 2012, according to LinkedIn.

Earlier this week, the bank settled for $65 million with the New York attorney general\u2019s office which alleged that the bank misled investors about its sales practices.

Roughly 90 percent of customers successfully avoid paying servicing fees on checking accounts by meeting certain requirements, said Wells Fargo spokesman Jim Seitz.  Consumers can get waivers for the monthly fee by connecting a qualifying direct deposit or keeping the a minimum daily balance among other things.  The bank has made changes to address guidelines for how to get a waiver through debit card use that had the potential to be confusing. \u201cWe have made improvements in how we communicate all of the ways customers qualify for a monthly service fee waiver, and how they can track their progress,\u201d Seitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do for our customers.\u201d  The disclosure adds to the long list of remediation efforts going on at the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets after a string of admissions that it may have improperly charged customers for various financial products.

The Federal Reserve in early 2018 ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion, until it had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practice scandals.  Wells Fargo spokeswoman Arati Randolph on Saturday said the bank could not comment on regulatory matters, adding that it was focused on satisfying the requirements of the consent order.  \u201cDuring these challenging times, we are very focused on doing all we can for our clients while operating under the constraints of the asset cap,\u201d Randolph said in an email.  The Federal Reserve declined to comment.  The central bank imposed the unprecedented cap as a penalty for sales practices and abuses at Wells Fargo, including the opening millions of phony accounts and overcharging customers on products ranging from mortgages to auto loans.  The cap has been a drag on Wells Fargo\u2019s reputation and earnings. Chief Executive Charles Scharf, who took over in October, has made it a priority to resolve outstanding regulatory matters.

Owners overwhelmingly backed executive pay and directors at the $256 billion bank\u2019s at times ill-tempered annual meeting on Tuesday. It\u2019s Sloan\u2019s first good news after a slew of regulatory hits, including last week\u2019s $1 billion fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The San Francisco-based bank took the event on the road this year, to Des Moines, Iowa. A number of its critics tagged along, haranguing Sloan and Chair Betsy Duke on a whole host of issues.  A grandmother who said she had been shot by a rubber bullet while protesting the Keystone pipeline attacked them for financing it. Sloan also had a testy exchange with a teacher protesting Wells\u2019s role in financing companies that manufacture and sell assault rifles. And Californian State Treasurer John Chiang got in a couple of zingers to help his bid to become the Golden State\u2019s governor this year. \u201cMr. Sloan is not draining the swamp,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has become it.\u201d  It was enough to briefly raise the possibility that Sloan might lose a vote at the two-and-a-half-hour meeting. But the ballots went his way, as did several other moments. Chief among these was Duke\u2019s rebuttal to Chiang\u2019s broadside. It drew some of the loudest applause of the day.  Duke deserves his thanks not just for that, but for her help since she was tapped to lead the board last summer. Since then, the former Federal Reserve governor has sounded out investors holding more than a third of the bank\u2019s stock, helped revamp the board \u2013 including taking the blame on Tuesday for some of its shortcomings - and spearheading the creation of a stakeholder advisory council. Two of its members took the board to task at the meeting, albeit politely.  They chided the bank for not being regarded as a leader on issues like guns and livable wages. Standing out on such concerns, under the guise of corporate citizenship, is one of several targets Sloan has set for fixing Wells\u2019s culture. He has also pledged to improve customer service, employee engagement and risk management. Achieving these goals, as well as improving the top and bottom lines, will be no easy task.","264":"(Adds hearing starting, share price)  WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co Chief Executive Tim Sloan, who has been campaigning to prove his bank has moved past its scandals, appeared in Congress on Tuesday before newly empowered Democratic lawmakers who are taking aim at Wall Street.  Sloan is the first bank executive grilled by the House Financial Services Committee since it was taken over by Democrats following the 2018 congressional election. A nervous Wall Street is keen to see how hostile the panel will be towards the industry.  The hearing could see Sloan clash with panel chair and vocal bank critic Maxine Waters, as well as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a rookie lawmaker and leading voice of her party\u2019s progressive wing. Fellow freshman Katie Porter likewise built her campaign on bashing Wall Street.  Republicans have also criticized Wells Fargo, and will likely want proof the fourth-largest U.S. bank has addressed customer abuses.  The CEOs of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc , Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp are expected to appear before the House panel next month.  Stakes are high for 31-year Wells Fargo veteran Sloan, who was appointed CEO when John Stumpf retired soon after the sales practices scandal erupted in 2016. Sloan has faced calls to step down from investors and politicians, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 Democratic presidential contender.  Wells Fargo shares were up 0.3 percent as the hearing started.  Sloan\u2019s prepared remarks emphasized changes the bank has made to culture, sales practices and risk management, as well as efforts to repay wronged customers.  \u201cWells Fargo is a better bank than it was three years ago, and we are working every day to become even better,\u201d Sloan, 58, will say, according to testimony published by the bank on Monday.  Lawmakers could also ask about the bank\u2019s decision to cut thousands of U.S. jobs, its pledge to boost stock buybacks and its forced arbitration policy for customers.  Spokespeople for Waters and Ocasio-Cortez declined or did not respond to comment requests. Porter said in a statement on Monday that Sloan has \u201ca lot to prove\u201d to show Wells Fargo has turned a corner.  If lawmakers are unhappy with what they hear, they could pressure the Federal Reserve to maintain restrictions imposed on the bank\u2019s growth until governance and risk management improve.  Sloan has not appeared before Congress since a 2017 Senate hearing, where he clashed with lawmakers from both parties.  Wells Fargo has since deployed more lobbyists in Washington and launched a public relations offensive, but remains in politicians\u2019 crosshairs.

The penalty was a record from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and comes more than eighteen months after Wells Fargo admitted it opened sham accounts for customers - a practice that likely ensnared millions.  Wells Fargo said the settlement lowers its first-quarter 2018 net income by 16 cents per share to 96 cents per share. It had flagged a possible settlement when it reported earnings last week and said then it may need to restate results.  The penalty is the first by Mick Mulvaney, whom U.S. President Donald Trump tapped in November as interim head of the CFPB, and fulfills Trump\u2019s vow to come down hard on the country\u2019s third-largest lender.  Mulvaney has worked to dial back the reach of the independent agency, and Reuters has reported the CFPB has dropped cases against at least two payday lenders.  \u201cWe will enforce the law,\u201d Mulvaney said in a statement about the Wells Fargo deal. \u201cThat is what we did here.\u201d  While the fine will sting Wells Fargo, regulators did offer the bank some relief in the settlement.  The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a sister regulator to the CFPB dropped Wells Fargo\u2019s designation as \u201ctroubled\u201d which will make it easier for departing employees to collect payouts.

Under the agreement, the OCC will still not be able to hire new executives without a sign-off from regulators.  Wells Fargo agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying wrongdoing.  \u201cWhile we have more work to do, these orders affirm that we share the same priorities with our regulators and that we are committed to working with them,\u201d Wells Fargo president and chief executive Timothy J. Sloan said in a statement.  Taken together, the mortgage and auto programs ensnared more than 600,000 customers and will require nearly $300 million in refunds, the bank has said.  The programs allowed Wells Fargo to earn fees from unneeded car insurance and penalties on mortgage paperwork that the bank had botched.  For homebuyers, Wells Fargo promised to \u201crate lock\u201d or freeze the interest rate for borrowers who got their mortgage paperwork finished within a few weeks.  When that deadline slipped and it was the bank\u2019s fault, Wells Fargo could blame the customer. The penalty for late mortgage paperwork often topped $1000, according to a borrower lawsuit.  Drivers stung by insurance fees were wrongly pushed into policies that they did not need.  Drivers must carry auto insurance but the bank has a right to \u201cforce place\u201d a policy on borrowers who let coverage lapse. Insurers working for Wells Fargo pushed policies onto more than 500,000 customers who already had coverage, the bank has said.  In July, Wells Fargo blamed a third-party vendor for wrongly layering insurance policies on its auto borrowers. Wells Fargo did not explain that it received payouts when those policies were written.","270":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it would \"temporarily and narrowly\" modify the growth restriction on Wells Fargo & Co's WFC.N balance sheet, allowing the bank to make more loans under government assistance programs for small businesses hurt by the coronavirus disruption.

The announcement prompted Wells Fargo to announce it was expanding its participation in the small business rescue program after initially restricting its lending capacity at $10 billion due to regulatory requirements despite seeing high demand.  Wells Fargo, one of the largest U.S. small business lenders, received over 170,000 indications of interest for the program within the first two days.  Small businesses have been hit hard by the COVID1-19 pandemic, which has shuttered, at least temporarily, non-essential businesses in many states and curbed consumer spending.  The bank has been urging the Fed to lift the asset cap so it can unleash its full lending capacity to support struggling businesses and consumers, but regulators were initially cold to the idea, Reuters has reported.  The liquidity crunch facing Main Street has helped the scandal-plagued bank pick up unlikely advocates, including Wall Street watchdog group Better Markets and former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) chair Sheila Bair, who have said the Fed should grant the bank more leeway to make sure small businesses can access much-needed funds.  Loans made under the new government programs will not count toward the $1.95 trillion asset cap the Fed imposed on the bank in February 2018. The Fed has said it would only remove the cap when Wells Fargo had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practice scandals.  \u201cTo date the firm has to date not satisfied all of the requirements for removal of the asset growth restriction,\u201d Fed officials said in the amended consent order on Wednesday.

The bank is prohibited from growing in size after the Federal Reserve slapped it with an unprecedented asset cap in February 2018, citing \u201cwidespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns.\u201d  The bank\u2019s retirement plan services unit, which includes Wells\u2019 401(k) savings accounts business, would expand a similar business of Principal Financial. If the negotiations are concluded successfully, a deal could be announced later this month, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is confidential.  Wells Fargo and Principal Financial declined to comment.  Based in Des Moines, Iowa, Principal Financial is a life insurance and financial services group with a market capitalization of $14.5 billion.  It is the latest in a series of divestments pursued by Wells Fargo.  In 2018, Wells Fargo announced deals to sell 52 branches spread across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin to Flagstar Bancorp Inc, as well as a $1.7 billion deal to offload its Puerto Rico auto finance business to the local unit of Popular Inc.  The disclosure three years ago that Wells Fargo created millions of fake customer accounts prompted regulatory probes into mortgage foreclosures, auto insurance sales and its wealth management businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines.","274":"(Adds details)  April 20 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co has agreed to pay $1 billion in penalties to federal regulators to settle a probe into abuses at its auto and mortgage businesses, the bank and regulators said on Friday, confirming an earlier Reuters report.  The settlement is the most aggressive move by regulators during the Trump administration to punish a major bank and follows revelations that the United States\u2019 third-largest lender had opened millions of sham retail accounts that customers did not want.  Wells Fargo said the settlement reduces its reported first-quarter 2018 net income by 16 cents per share to 96 cents per share. The bank said it has adjusted its preliminary results to account for an additional accrual of $800 million.  Wells Fargo said it would also be required to submit, for review by its board, plans detailing ongoing efforts to strengthen compliance and risk management, and its approach to customer remediation efforts.

Wells Fargo will be the first bank to face a grilling by House Democrats who took over the committee in the new Congress. The discussion will likely revolve around the widespread consumer abuses that took place at the bank, the report said.  JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley chiefs will meet with the committee in April, although formal invitations have yet to be sent to the banks, WSJ said.  Wells Fargo declined to comment and the other banks did not immediately respond to a Reuters\u2019 request for comment.  The House Financial Services Committee, run by long time Wall Street critic U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, has stressed industry accountability ever since Democrats took over the powerful government body that oversees the U.S. housing market, insurance and international finance sectors, among other areas.  Waters has already called for Wells Fargo to be broken up or shut down, and has described JPMorgan and Citigroup as recidivist banks.  U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, part of a new crop of Democrats that swept into office this year on a stronger liberal platform, and who was appointed to the Financial Services Committee earlier this year, has also campaigned on issues that put her at odds with the financial industry, including separating commercial and investment banking, breaking up large banks, and forgiving student debt.","276":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Although Wells Fargo & Co settled major probes with federal agencies over abusive sales practices last week, the bank and its former executives are not out of the woods yet, legal and regulatory experts said.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Wells, the fourth-largest U.S. lender, reached a $3 billion deal with the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday related to opening fake customer accounts. Prosecutors agreed not to pursue criminal charges against the bank if Wells cooperates with other investigations and complies with relevant laws for three years.  However, the deal did not address issues with Wells\u2019 mortgage and auto-lending businesses, where customers were enrolled in unwanted products that charged fees. Nor does it preclude potential charges against individuals who were in charge at the time of sales abuses.  \u201cThe damage train for Wells Fargo may keep rolling along,\u201d said Erik Gerding, a law professor at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Chief Executive Charlie Scharf on Friday said the bank is \u201ccommitting all necessary resources\u201d to prevent anything similar in the future.  Ex-CEO John Stumpf and onetime head of community banking Carrie Tolstedt were among eight former Wells Fargo executives sanctioned by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) last month. The regulator banned Stumpf from the banking industry and sought over $58 million in civil penalties. Five of the bankers are contesting the matter.  U.S. authorities have been investigating individuals, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. It is not clear they will pursue anything beyond monetary penalties or that they will be successful.  U.S. Attorney Andrew Murray on Friday described the wrongdoing as \u201cknown to, if not encouraged by, the highest levels within Wells Fargo.\u201d The Justice Department also outlined \u201cextreme\u201d pressure that executives placed on employees to hit sales targets, which encouraged the unlawful and unethical conduct at the heart of the customer abuses.  The agreement was the latest in a string of regulatory and legal settlements Wells Fargo has reached since the scandal erupted in 2016. The bank is still operating under consent orders, which include an unprecedented asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve. Its CEO and board of directors will come under fresh scrutiny at congressional hearings next month.  Investors are hoping management can resolve all the outstanding issues to help Wells Fargo\u2019s share price recover, but there may still be hurdles, said analysts.  The resolution was seen as positive, but the Fed\u2019s consent order remains the \u201cbigger overhang on shares,\u201d Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a note.","277":"FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo logo is seen at the SIBOS banking and financial conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, October 19, 2017.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith  The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets said on Thursday that CEO Tim Sloan, a 31-year Wells Fargo veteran, would resign immediately and a committee would meet on Friday to start looking for a replacement from outside the bank.  More than two years after its wide-ranging sales practices scandal first came to light, Wells Fargo is still struggling to repair its reputation and relationship with U.S. regulators.  \u201cReforming decades of past mistakes at an institution as large as Wells is a difficult and time-consuming endeavor,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Eric Compton in a note on Friday.  Wells Fargo shares were down 2.2 percent to $48.02 on Friday, after jumping more than 2.7 percent after the bank announced Sloan\u2019s resignation on Thursday.  Investors are pondering what the change in leadership will actually mean for the bank over the next year or two, Marty Mosby, an analyst at Vining Sparks IBG, said in a note on Friday.  \u201cThe intermediate transition period will not likely be as productive as we had been assuming, and the longer-term ramifications won\u2019t be played out for years,\u201d Mosby said.  Admissions by the bank that it opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts and improperly charged customers for services have resulted in billions of dollars in fines and settlements since 2016.  The Federal Reserve has also placed an unprecedented restriction on Wells Fargo to keep it from growing its balance sheet until it proves risk management controls are improved.  \u201cIt does seem that Wells Fargo management has lost the confidence of regulators,\u201d Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari told Reuters on Friday. \u201cIt will be important to put in a CEO that can regain that confidence.\u201d  It remained unclear what exactly triggered Sloan\u2019s abrupt departure. Sloan, who had been CEO since after the scandal erupted in 2016, said he made the decision because the focus on him was hampering the bank\u2019s recovery.  Sloan twice disappointed investors by pushing back the date he expected to get the asset cap removed.  When the consent order was announced in February 2018, he said reviews of its plan to meet the Fed\u2019s request would be completed in October of that year. In May he said the cap would be lifted in early 2019, but in January he told analysts he expected the bank to operate under the cap through 2019.  Analysts still say that timeline is too ambitious.  \u201cWe do not expect the asset cap to get lifted until mid-2020,\u201d said Citigroup Inc\u2019 analyst Keith Horowitz in a note on Thursday.  KBW\u2019S Brian Kleinhanzl also wrote in a note that the bank seems to be far from convincing the Fed that it has made sufficient changes.  Banks typically operate under consent orders from the Fed for many years. The Fed has yet to end a 2013 enforcement order against JPMorgan Chase & Co related to its London Whale scandal, according to an analysis of the U.S. central bank\u2019s public notices. A 2011 consent order against 10 banks related to crisis-era mortgage practices ended last year.  Wells Fargo executives did not provide new information about when they expected the Fed to lift the asset cap on Thursday.  TRIMMING COSTS  Outside of regulatory pressures, the new CEO will also be faced with investors who want management to shore up the bank\u2019s core business. Wells Fargo was the only bank among the top four U.S. lenders to not grow loans or deposits over the past two years, according to Refinitiv data.  While current executives have suspended the bank\u2019s 2020 expense target to give a new CEO room for a novel strategy, analysts expect incoming management to maintain Wells Fargo\u2019s approach of growing profits by getting leaner.  \u201cI think the new CEO is going to take the path of trimming costs and buying back stocks and you still won\u2019t see a lot of balance sheet expansion in terms of loan growth because they are under that cap,\u201d said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders.  Wells Fargo Board Chair Betsy Duke did not give clear guidelines on what kinds of candidates the board is looking for.  The next CEO will likely be a finance executive with experience with consumer banking and digital strategy, as well as the ability to smooth relationships with Washington, analysts said.  Citi\u2019s Horowitz said JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, who has experience running the consumer bank at the largest U.S. bank by assets, would be his first call.  A seasoned executive from a financial technology company already based in San Francisco could also be a good fit, said Edward Jones\u2019 Sanders.","280":"A federal appeals court has rejected a bid by Miami Gardens to revive a lawsuit accusing Wells Fargo of mortgage discrimination, saying the Florida city did not offer evidence that it was injured by the bank\u2019s lending practices.

The lender said in July it would launch a broad cost-cutting initiative this year as the bank braces for massive loan losses caused by the pandemic and continues to work through expensive regulatory and operational problems tied to a long-running sales scandal.  Layoffs, branch closures and cuts to third-party spending are on the table, the bank\u2019s executives had then said.  \u201cWe expect to reduce the size of our workforce through a combination of attrition, the elimination of open roles, and job displacements,\u201d a spokeswoman said in an email, adding that Wells Fargo was working to bring its expenses more in line with its peers and create a company that is more \u201cnimble\u201d.

Bloomberg News first reported the resumed job cuts on Friday.

FILE PHOTO: Charles Scharf, Chairman and CEO, BNY Mellon, speaks at the 2019 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Scharf, 54, who joins the fourth-largest U.S. bank next month, has been the CEO of Bank of New York Mellon BK.N and Visa Inc V.N.  He served as a top lieutenant to JPMorgan Chase and Co\u2019s JPM.N Dimon during the financial crisis of 2008. He will become Wells Fargo's third CEO in as many years after a wide-ranging sales practices scandal.  Some analysts said Scharf\u2019s departure from Bank of New York Mellon, where he served only for two years, would hurt the custodian bank. Bank of New York Mellon named former finance head Thomas Gibbons as its CEO on an interim basis. Its shares closed 4.2% lower, while Wells Fargo rose 3.5% on Friday.  \u201cHe\u2019s a good choice,\u201d said former Wells Fargo CEO Dick Kovacevich. \u201cHe\u2019s very experienced in almost all of these financial services areas.\u201d  Scharf has his work cut out for him.  Wells Fargo is operating under a regulatory microscope, as it tries to rebuild its reputation with customers, investors and politicians after employee whistleblowers revealed in 2016 that the bank had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts.  Since then, internal and regulatory probes have discovered other issues in the bank\u2019s businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines and penalties.  Its core businesses and shares have lagged.  From 2016-2018, Wells Fargo was the only bank among the top four U.S. lenders to not grow loans or deposits, according to Refinitiv data. Wells Fargo shares have fallen short of the KBW Bank Index as the board looked for a new CEO. Analysts cited uncertainly about management and future financial targets as a top concern.  On Friday, Wall Street analysts applauded the bank\u2019s pick but warned that major regulatory hurdles remained.  \u201cThe appointment of Mr. Scharf removes a major overhang,\u201d Saul Martinez of UBS wrote in a note to clients.  While the news cheered Wells Fargo investors, analysts said it was a negative for Bank of New York Mellon.  KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said he was unsure what to expect from Scharf as Wells\u2019 CEO since his tenure at Bank of New York Mellon lasted only for two years.  He added that at Bank of New York, Scharf had gone \u201con a hiring spree to bring in his people, and now that he has left, long-term strategy is in flux.\u201d  DIVERSITY GOAL  Scharf\u2019s appointment is a win for Wells Fargo. Sources have said that the board\u2019s search process was fraught, with limits on how much the bank could have paid its new chief executive and the requirement that regulators approved of their choice.  The board had said it wanted to find an outsider, a key parameter for satisfying critics in Washington. The board also initially looked the possibility of hiring a diverse candidate, especially a woman, sources have previously said.  But several candidates that the board approached were not interested in the job. At one point, the board considered keeping its interim CEO, Allen Parker, on a permanent basis.  Parker will return to his previous role of general counsel and help the company through its transition.  \u201cThey really realized that they needed a competent CEO who could handle the issues at Wells and the regulators, and it didn\u2019t matter \u2013 race, gender, those things were secondary,\u201d one of the sources familiar with the matter said, referring to the board.  Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment on the nature of the search process. A spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of Currency said the banking regulator had signed off on Scharf\u2019s hiring, clearing a major hurdle in the executive search process.  Two sources who know Scharf describe him as someone more at home with numbers. When he became the CEO at Visa, people joked the company had two chief financial officers - the actual CFO and Scharf, one of the sources said.  At Visa, he is credited with transforming the payment giant\u2019s technology platform and saw the stock price more than double. Scharf was tasked with reinvigorating growth at BNY, a custodian bank which executes back office operations for asset managers.  There he quickly made changes designed to make the company more efficient like overhauling meetings and making leadership changes. So far those changes have not paid off as BNY shares are trading lower than when Scharf took the helm.  One of the sources said Scharf always had aspirations to be the chief executive of a big bank. If his tenure at the San Fransico-based bank goes well, Scharf will have a claim to the same fame as his one-time boss Dimon, the source said.","285":"FILE PHOTO: Wells Fargo Bank branch is seen in New York City, U.S., March 17, 2020.

The pandemic has shuttered Black owned-businesses at twice the rate of small businesses overall.  Other major lenders, including Citigroup Inc C.N, have made similar pledges not to profit from the government stimulus program meant to help small businesses hard hit by mandatory COVID-19 related shutdowns. But those banks have said they will use some of the fees generated to cover costs associated with quickly rolling out the hulking infrastructure needed to run the program.

Those drivers are also suing Wells Fargo in a federal court in California for more compensation that the bank is willing to pay.  The faulty insurance program ran from 2002 to 2016 but the bank only intends to compensate drivers forced into policies from 2005 onwards, Wells Fargo has told the federal judge overseeing the case.  Wells Fargo\u2019s reluctance to compensate all drivers contradicts its pledge to help every customer who was hurt and that could intensify scrutiny of the scandal-plagued bank.  Lawyers for the drivers have argued that the compensation plan should cover the entire life of the insurance program but the bank is not persuaded, according to court documents obtained by Reuters.  \u201cThere\u2019s no credible reason why you don\u2019t go back to the inception of the program,\u201d Roland Tellis, an attorney for the drivers, said at an August hearing.  Tellis did not respond to requests for further comment.  Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, told lawmakers last year that the bank was \u201cworking diligently to make things right for every customer who was harmed.\u201d  But a lawyer for the bank argued at the same court hearing that it has already \u201ccompromised\u201d by allowing payouts from 2005 to 2016, according to the official court transcript.  Wells Fargo has records from the first three years of the insurance program but those are held in a separate database to the 2005-2016 files, the lawyer said. He did not explain why the bank did not wish to access the earlier database and the bank declined to elaborate when contacted by Reuters.  Any driver who believes that he or she was hurt in the insurance program can contact the bank directly and make a claim, a spokeswoman for the bank said.  \u201cWe invite them to reach out to us with their insurance information,\u201d Wells Fargo said in a statement to Reuters.  Tellis and other lawyers want a payout exceeding three times what drivers were charged, which could add costs and uncertainty to a scandal that continues to worry investors.  The final terms of the private litigation could affect the ongoing remediation plan the bank agreed with federal regulators.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) allowed the bank to limit its payout plan to the 2005-2016 time frame in its April settlement with the bank. A spokesman for the bureau declined to comment on the scope of the payout plan.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which had a part in the April fine, declined to comment.

REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni\/File Photo  The fourth-largest U.S. bank booked hundreds of millions of dollars in fresh customer remediation and rebate costs in the second quarter, fueling worries about lingering scandal-related fallout.  Wall Street has been pressuring Wells Fargo to deliver more revenue to the bottom line for over two years. That ramped up once the bank landed in regulatory and reputational trouble over sales practices, and management responded with hard cost-cutting goals.  But Wells Fargo has faced more challenges since, with businesses like mortgage lending shrinking and the Federal Reserve imposing an asset cap until the bank proves governance and controls have improved.  It is also no longer receiving revenue from some products it missold as recently as last year, like add-on insurance.  As a result, analysts say it may take until 2020 for Wells Fargo to get its efficiency ratio within the 55 percent to 59 percent range Chief Executive Tim Sloan has pledged to hit. It has not reported a ratio below 60 percent since September 2016.  That metric, which measures the cost of one dollar of revenue, was 66.7 percent at Wells Fargo during the first half of the year. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase & Co's JPM.N efficiency ratio was 57.6 percent.  Two-thirds of the analysts who updated estimates since second-quarter results now see the ratio staying at or above 60 percent through 2019, according to Thomson Reuters data. Prior to earnings, the consensus for the ratio was 59.5 percent.  \u201cIt\u2019s dragging on longer that what people originally expected,\u201d said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders, referencing costs associated with the bank\u2019s past wrongdoings.  Sanders did not change estimates much after the second-quarter report but said his models were more conservative than other research houses.  Wells Fargo was once the most valuable bank in the world by market value, as investors rewarded the company for its perceived profitability and growth potential.  But revelations about millions of customers getting locked into unnecessary products has forced investors to rethink how they value the stock, which has lagged rivals since September 2016. (tmsnrt.rs\/2M6C0rP)  The bank pledged to shut 800 branches by 2020, and has cut 4,600 employees from its payroll since 2016. The efforts are part of Sloan\u2019s goal to slash $4 billion from annual expenses by next year.  While executives reiterated that pledge in recent weeks, they have declined to provide a near-term efficiency ratio target.  Management initially expected to approach 59 percent by the end of 2018, but said in April actions to comply with the Fed\u2019s consent order would delay progress.  Analysts say it could take more than a year to get there, given the business pressures and scandal costs.  \u201cIt\u2019s not an outrageous target,\u201d said Sanders, of Edward Jones. \u201cThey do have lot of levers to pull on in terms of squeezing costs out of the business.\u201d","290":"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N is close to settling a record fine of $1 billion imposed by two U.S. regulators for its risk management business, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.

Specifically, the CFTC said that Wells Fargo failed to properly price a $4 billion foreign exchange forward contract with an unnamed counterparty from 2014.  Rather than calculate an agreed upon weighted average price for the deal, the bank simply picked a rate it thought would be in the average range and acceptable to the counterparty, according to the regulator.  The CFTC said the bank provided a spreadsheet to the counterparty that supposedly showed how that average was calculated, even though the bank lacked the ability to track the trades that would provide the basis for the calculation.

The $350 billion loan program, which launched on Friday, will provide low-interest loans to help small businesses cover payroll and other fixed costs such as rent, mortgages and utilities over the next eight weeks.  \u201cWhile we are actively working to create balance sheet capacity to lend, we are limited in our ongoing ability to use our strong capital and liquidity position to extend additional credit,\u201d Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said in a statement.  The Federal Reserve in early 2018 ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion, until it had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practice scandals. The bank started 2020 with roughly $20 billion of room under the cap, according to filings.  Wells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. lender, has urged the U.S. Federal Reserve to lift the asset cap on the bank to help it support businesses and customers hit by economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has reported. But so far regulators have been cold on the idea.  \u201cWe are committed to helping our customers during these unprecedented and challenging times, but are restricted in our ability to serve as many customers as we would like,\u201d Scharf said.  The San Francisco-based lender said it has likely reached its $10 billion limit based on the applications it has already received, and will prioritize giving loans to non-profits and businesses with fewer than 50 employees. The bank will also give fees received from the program to non-profits focused on small business.  Small businesses, which employ about half of U.S. private sector employees, have been dramatically hurt by the coronavirus pandemic as states have halted non-essential businesses and consumers curb their spending.  Banks have been flooded with applications from clients looking for a piece of bailout fund.  Bank of America Corp BAC.N, the first large bank to begin accepting applications on Friday morning, said it received 85,000 applications requesting $22 billion on the first day.  Wells Fargo opened its portal on Saturday.  The bank said it was helping customers in other ways including deferring payments and waiving fees. Last month the bank deferred nearly $1.8 billion in payments and waved more than $28 million in fees for customers affected by the coronavirus recession.","296":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N has agreed to pay $3 billion to resolve criminal and civil probes into fraudulent sales practices and has admitted to pressuring employees in a fake-accounts scandal, U.S. officials said on Friday, wrapping up one of the last major investigations looming over the bank.  Wells Fargo will pay the penalties to the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission and enter into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement during which the San Francisco-based bank will continue to cooperate with any ongoing government investigations, Justice Department officials said.  As part of the deal, Wells Fargo admitted that between 2002 and 2016 it pressured employees to meet \u201cunrealistic sales goals that led thousands of employees to provide millions of accounts or products to customers under false pretenses or without consent, often by creating false records or misusing customers\u2019 identities,\u201d the department said in a statement.  In a statement, Charles Scharf, Wells Fargo\u2019s new chief executive, described the past conduct as \u201creprehensible.\u201d Wells Fargo is the fourth-largest U.S. lender.  \u201cThis case illustrates a complete failure of leadership at multiple levels within the bank. Simply put, Wells Fargo traded its hard-earned reputation for short-term profits, and harmed untold numbers of customers along the way,\u201d Nick Hanna, U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, said in a statement.  Top managers within Wells Fargo\u2019s Community Bank division were aware of the \u201cunlawful and unethical\u201d practices as early as 2002, and many of the practices were referred to as \u201cgaming\u201d within the bank, the Justice Department said.  The agreement resolves the civil and criminal liability regarding Wells Fargo\u2019s fake-accounts scandal.  About $500 million of the penalties will go to the SEC to be distributed to investors to settle charges that the bank committed fraud by misleading investors about its sales practices, an SEC official said on a call with reporters about the resolutions settlement.  Settling the multi-agency investigation marked an important milestone for Scharf, who joined the company from BNY Mellon in September shortly after the third anniversary of the scandal.  \u201cWe are committing all necessary resources to ensure that nothing like this happens again, while also driving Wells Fargo forward,\u201d Scharf said.  \u2018GHOST IN A MACHINE\u2019  Watchdog group Public Citizen criticized the deal, saying it does not go far enough.  \u201cAny resolution for Wells Fargo\u2019s massive, management-directed misconduct must hold individuals to account.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith  The deal does not preclude civil or criminal charges against individuals, Justice Department officials told reporters.  U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, wrote on Twitter, \u201cThis is a small step in the right direction, but it\u2019s not a substitute for holding senior executives individually accountable - and bringing criminal charges against them if the evidence justifies it.\u201d  The probe examined activities in Wells Fargo\u2019s community bank unit, with Justice Department citing pressure coming from the division\u2019s leadership.  In a rare move last month, a U.S. bank regulator charged several former Wells Fargo executives for their roles in the scandal. That included a settlement with former CEO John Stumpf and civil charges against Carrie Tolstedt, former head of the community bank unit.  \u201cMs. Tolstedt acted appropriately and in good faith at all times, and the effort to scapegoat her is both unfair and unfounded,\u201d her lawyer Enu Mainigi said on Friday.  The Justice Department inquiry was seen by analysts and investors as a key hurdle the bank had to clear before it could focus on its growth strategy, which includes convincing the Federal Reserve to remove an unprecedented growth restriction placed on Wells Fargo\u2019s balance sheet until it proves it has fixed its risk management and controls.  Wells Fargo had already paid out more than $4 billion in fines and penalties related to the scandal since 2016. Internal and external probes have uncovered issues in each of Wells Fargo\u2019s major business lines, including wealth management and the commercial bank.  The U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee is scheduled to hold three hearings on Wells Fargo\u2019s conduct next month.  Over the past three years, Wells Fargo has taken various steps to fix its issues and rebuild trust with customers, investors and regulators. They include changes to its board, centralizing risk teams and hiring an external chief executive. However, ongoing reputation issues and unresolved legal matters have weighed on the bank\u2019s stock price and profitability, which have lagged peers since 2016.","297":"March 1 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co:  * WELLS FARGO & CO - JOHN CHEN, LLOYD DEAN, ENRIQUE HERNANDEZ JR, & FEDERICO PE\u00d1A HAVE DECIDED TO RETIRE AT CO\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS  * WELLS FARGO & CO - BOARD WILL NOMINATE 12 OF ITS CURRENT DIRECTORS FOR ELECTION AT COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL MEETING Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","298":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s two biggest competitors have been nabbing market share in lending to commercial and industrial customers in the American heartland, a sign of how difficult it has become for the scandal-tarnished bank to defend its position against rivals.

REUTERS\/Jim Young\/File Photo  Earnings reports in recent days showed Wells Fargo\u2019s book of C&I loans in the United States down 1 percent, on average, during the first quarter compared with the year-earlier period. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s gained 5 percent and Bank of America Corp\u2019s was 4 percent higher.  Although the banks define C&I loans somewhat differently, their reports track government data showing Wells falling behind over the past five years from a near-tie with Bank of America and losing ground to JPMorgan. (GRAPHIC: tmsnrt.rs\/2qDp7Na)  Those two banks attributed gains to opening offices and adding bankers in smaller cities around the country, a strategy Wells Fargo has embraced for decades. But as Wells struggles to recover from a sales scandal that has touched customers in businesses ranges from deposits, credit cards, mortgages and auto lending to wealth management, it has become harder for the bank to maintain its competitive edge.  Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said as much on Friday when an analyst asked whether Wells Fargo is losing any customers because of negative headlines.  \u201cWe have to compete a little bit harder,\u201d he said, noting that rivals have been trying harder to steal business during Wells Fargo\u2019s time of vulnerability.  Asked by Reuters about the decline in C&I lending specifically, Shrewsberry said that while Wells Fargo competes aggressively on pricing, it has been stricter about loan structures than other banks. For example, Wells might give a borrower a lower interest rate but would not offer a bigger loan or extend the duration or relax loan terms.  Since 2010, JPMorgan has opened 52 new commercial lending offices, including in San Francisco, where Wells is based, as well as in Silicon Valley\u2019s Palo Alto, Omaha, Nebraska, and Memphis, Tennessee. It has also hired as many as 100 commercial bankers each year, many of whom cater to companies with annual revenue of just $20 million to $500 million.  Using a similar strategy, Bank of America has hired some 400 commercial bankers in recent years.  Banks tend to forge long-lasting bonds with C&I borrowers that can lead to additional work, such as managing cash, handling payments, issuing corporate credit cards, raising money in capital markets and even advising on acquisitions. That makes Wells Fargo\u2019s market share decline particularly troubling, said Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl.  \u201cIf you are winning the C&I piece, you are deepening the relationship, which is good for revenue growth,\u201d he said.  The market share shift represents a change in fortune for Wells, which came through the 2007-2009 financial crisis strong enough to acquire a failing rival and avoid many of the embarrassing scandals that plagued other big banks.  That changed in September 2016, when Wells reached a $190 million regulatory settlement over opening what turned out to be as many as 3.5 million phony customer accounts to hit sales targets. Since then, the No. 3 U.S. bank by assets has discovered several other problems and now faces another regulatory penalty of $1 billion.  Executives have downplayed the scandal\u2019s impact on profitability or market share, saying Wells is \u201copen for business,\u201d and that few customers have left.  But analysts who spoke to Reuters said they believe the scandal is starting to hurt Wells Fargo\u2019s competitive edge, either because customers are displeased or because executives are too distracted by lawsuits, regulatory probes and organizational changes to run the bank as well as they otherwise would.  \u201cObviously, management has been focused on the issues around the sales practices,\u201d said Allen Tischler, an analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service who has tracked the lost market share.  Nonetheless, Wells\u2019 CFO Shrewsberry was optimistic about the outlook for C&I lending, which he expects to grow this year as commercial borrowers take on more leverage for expansion plans.  Speaking about Wells Fargo\u2019s balance sheet more broadly, he said areas with sharp declines, like auto and home equity loans, are where the bank has purposefully pulled back because of credit concerns.  \u201cOur loan portfolio is getting safer and safer,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s smaller.\u201d","299":"(Adds company background, comment by Wells Fargo spokesman)  Nov 15 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Thursday it notified about 1,000 employees in its Consumer Lending and Payments, Virtual Solutions and Innovations groups of plans to eliminate their positions.  The layoffs are consistent with the bank\u2019s previously announced plans to reduce headcount by up to 10 percent by 2020, spokesman Tom Goyda said. Wells Fargo, the No. 4 U.S. bank by assets, had about 262,000 employees as of Sept. 30.  Most of those affected received 60-day notices, but some received pre-notices, meaning they will get a 60-day notice sometime next year.  About 900 of the layoffs are in the bank\u2019s home lending unit, reflecting declines in application volume and the number of customers in default. The cuts will be spread across the United States but are concentrated in Des Moines, Iowa, which is expected to have about 400 reductions, and Fort Mill, South Carolina, which is expected to have 111 cuts.  \u201cWe are committed to retaining as many team members as possible and will do everything we can to help them identify other opportunities within Wells Fargo,\u201d Goyda said.  Earlier this year, the company announced plans to reduce its overall headcount by up to 26,000 over the next three years to reflect changing consumer preferences as more customers use self-service technology to do their banking.  The cuts are intended to help the bank reach its goal of reducing costs by $4 billion by 2020 as it tries to increase profit and recover from a series of scandals while operating under the Federal Reserve\u2019s asset cap.  Over the summer, the bank laid off 600 employees in its mortgage division which has faced challenges due to a slowdown in refinancing demand.  Aside from headcount reductions, Wells Fargo has pledged to lower costs and become more efficient by reducing its branch count by about 800 by 2020 and by selling noncore businesses.

Wells Fargo & Company CEO and President Tim Sloan testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Aaron P. Bernstein  Asked whether an asset cap imposed by the U.S. Federal Reserve would have any impact on Wells Fargo\u2019s expenses, growth, core businesses, customer retention, employee turnover or capital return plans, Sloan said repeatedly that nothing much had changed.  \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely open for business,\u201d Sloan said at a Credit Suisse industry conference. He has returned to that catch-phrase repeatedly to dampen concerns about fallout from the scandal.  Wells Fargo\u2019s problems took root more than a decade ago, when the bank started pushing employees to sell as many products as possible to customers.  That culture became a serious problem for the bank in September 2016, when it reached a settlement with regulators over employees opening fake accounts in customers\u2019 names without their permission to hit aggressive sales targets.  Since then, Wells Fargo has discovered other issues with auto loans, mortgages, frozen funds and improperly closed accounts and has faced a number of other regulatory probes and litigation.  On Feb. 2, the Fed announced a consent order requiring Wells Fargo to prove that it is making appropriate changes to corporate governance and risk management. Until the requirements are met, Wells cannot grow its balance sheet beyond the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at year end.  Management immediately detailed plans to comply with the order, and said it would not hit profits significantly. Still, the severity of the Fed\u2019s action so many months after the scandal erupted, underlined questions about how long it will take for the bank to get past its sales practices woes.  At the event on Tuesday, Credit Suisse analyst Susan Katzke pressed Sloan on whether the Fed\u2019s action, and broader reputational issues, are affecting business on the ground, or management\u2019s outlook for growth and shareholder returns.  Sloan reiterated statements he has made about business being stable, employees being happy to work at the bank, and Wells Fargo management being focused on generating better results. Asked to share metrics to back up some of his comments, Sloan jokingly changed topics and began talking about the Olympics.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different metrics that you look at, but they\u2019re all pointing to a slow but steady recovery,\u201d he eventually said, without offering any specific numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s never as fast as I would like, but it\u2019s absolutely occurring.\u201d  Sloan also said the bank intends to get capital levels down to about 10 percent over the next two to three years. The bank ended 2017 with common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.9 percent.  Wells Fargo shares were up 2.1 percent at $57.69 in afternoon trading. Through Monday\u2019s close, the stock had lost nearly 14 percent since the Fed placed restrictions on it on Feb 2.","304":"March 29 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s plans to bring in an outsider as its next chief executive could give the scandal-plagued bank a much needed fresh start, but a turnaround will not be easy for whoever takes the helm, analysts said.  The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets said on Thursday that CEO Tim Sloan, a 31-year Wells Fargo veteran, would resign immediately and a committee would meet on Friday to start looking for a replacement from outside the bank.  More than two years after its wide-ranging sales practices scandal first came to light, Wells Fargo is still struggling to repair its reputation and relationship with U.S. regulators.  \u201cReforming decades of past mistakes at an institution as large as Wells is a difficult and time-consuming endeavor,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Eric Compton in a note on Friday.  It remains unclear what exactly triggered Sloan\u2019s abrupt departure. Sloan, who had been CEO since predecessor John Stumpf left the bank soon after the scandal erupted in 2016, said he made the decision because the focus on him had become a distraction and a hurdle to helping the bank recover.  Critics had accused Sloan, who was part of the management team while the wrongdoing was happening, of being too entrenched in Wells Fargo\u2019s culture to change it.  Wells Fargo Board Chair Betsy Duke did not give clear guidelines on what kinds of candidates the board is looking for.  The next CEO will likely be a finance executive with experience with consumer banking and digital strategy, analysts said. But it will also be important to find someone who can soothe Wells Fargo\u2019s strained relationships with U.S. regulators and politicians, they added.  Admissions by the bank that it opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts and improperly charged customers for services have resulted in billions of dollars in fines and settlements since 2016.  The Fed has also placed an unprecedented restriction on Wells Fargo to keep it from growing its balance sheet until it proves risk management controls are improved.  \u201cIt does seem that Wells Fargo management has lost the confidence of regulators,\u201d Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari told Reuters on Friday. \u201cIt will be important to put in a CEO that can regain that confidence.\u201d  Sloan had told analysts in January that he expected the bank to operate under the cap through 2019. Wells Fargo executives did not provide new information about when they expected the Fed to lift the asset cap on Thursday.  Analysts, however, now expect that the bank will need longer than its latest estimate before the Fed removes the restriction.  \u201cWe do not expect the asset cap to get lifted until mid-2020,\u201d said Citigroup Inc\u2019 analyst Keith Horowitz in a note on Thursday.  KBW\u2019S Brian Kleinhanzl also wrote in a note that the bank seems to be far from convincing the Fed that it has made sufficient changes.  To help alleviate the impact of the asset cap, Wells Fargo has been offloading parts of its business. It has already sold 52 Midwestern branches and its Puerto Rico auto finance business, and it is in advanced talks to divest its retirement plan services business. (Reporting by Imani Moise.

They said some lenders have been struggling to keeping up with the wave of originations following sweeping headcount reductions across the industry.  Large banks have laid off thousands of mortgage employees over the past two years as refinancing applications plunged and amid increased competition from non-bank entrants like Quicken Loans Inc.  The financial services industry tends to fire and rehire thousands of employees as revenue fluctuates, but analysts thought the most recent decline in the mortgage business would be permanent as the process has become more automated.  The Wells Fargo staffing plans will be fluid, allowing the bank to adjust to the market, the memo said.  The latest hiring initiative could throw a wrench into Wells Fargo\u2019s plans to cut costs. In July, the bank warned investors that 2020 costs would not be lower as previously expected since the bank hired thousands of employees to improve its risk management and work through the regulatory fallout from its various scandals.  The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets has leaned on cost cuts to stabilize its bottomline amid sluggish revenue trends. Now, the San Francisco-based bank must also contend with fresh macroeconomic uncertainty from a changing interest rate environment that\u2019s pressuring lending margins across the industry.","310":"BOSTON\/NEW YORK\/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Banks that facilitated the U.S. government\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program at first saw the effort as a small revenue booster with a patriotic bonus, shepherding $525 billion in loans to businesses slammed by the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.  FILE PHOTO: Customers wait in line outside a bank amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Chelsea, Massachusetts, U.S., May 11, 2020. REUTERS\/Brian Snyder  But as taxpayers begin to take on the cost of forgiving those loans, lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co and Bank of America Corp, are girding for what is likely to be years of regulatory scrutiny for their role in doling out the money, according to industry insiders, securities filings and government watchdogs.  \u201cThe sense of anxiety is high,\u201d said Vivian Merker, a management consultant to financial services firms at Oliver Wyman in New York. \u201cThey are gearing up for years of requests from regulators and there\u2019s still reputational risk from PPP fraud even if they did all the right things to follow program rules.\u201d  Banks participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) issued more than 5.2 million loans, to be repaid by the government as long as borrowers demonstrated financial need and used most of the cash to make payroll.  Fraud by borrowers popped up almost as quickly as the program, overseen by the Small Business Administration (SBA), began in April. The Department of Justice has so far brought charges against 82 individuals in 56 cases for around $250 million in loans, according to a review by the Project On Government Oversight.  So far, the burden on lenders has mostly been administrative. One veteran attorney who advises major banks on compliance matters said clients were responding to as many as 20 law enforcement subpoenas a week, producing documents and making employees available for interviews.  There is increasing concern, though, that the lenders themselves will face legal challenges over PPP, already leading to internal compliance reviews, investor warnings and even the outright sale of loan portfolios, according to public statements and people familiar with the situation.  At least four banks have warned investors in shareholder filings about PPP regulatory and legal risk. Bank of America, for example, said in a July filing that its participation in government stimulus programs \u201ccould result in reputational harm and government actions and proceedings, and has resulted in, and may continue to result in, litigation, including class actions.\u201d  \u201cWe fully cooperate with government inquiries,\u201d said Bill Halldin, a Bank Of America spokesperson.  POSSIBLE HAZARDS  Among the possible hazards, experts have pointed to potential violations of the program\u2019s first-come, first-served application rules, disadvantaging minority-owned and women-owned businesses; maintaining adequate documentation, especially for loan forgiveness applications; and abiding by broader \u201cknow your customer\u201d rules, which could have spotted more fraud.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Congress passed the $2.2-trillion Cares Act bailout in March which included nearly $350 billion for PPP loans, with the pot later increasing.  Under pressure to get the cash out the door fast, banks were initially concerned they would be taking on too much liability, even if they stood to earn origination fees of up to 5%, and 1% interest payments on government-guaranteed loans. Lenders secured a promise from the government that they would not be held responsible if borrowers broke the program rules.  An October congressional report said that several lenders, including JPMorgan, PNC Financial Services Group Inc and Truist Financial Corp, processed larger PPP loans for wealthy customers at two to four times the speed of smaller loans for the neediest small businesses.  It also said some banks limited their PPP loan programs to existing customers.  That decision, the report said, had a disproportionately adverse effect on women-owned and minority-owned businesses, because they are less likely to have pre-existing banking relationships, according to U.S. Federal Reserve data. Depending on the circumstances, policies that hurt such \u201cprotected\u201d groups - even if inadvertently - can violate fair lending rules.  Citing an internal April presentation, the report said that Citigroup identified the negative effect on these businesses as a possible compliance risk, but decided to initially prioritize existing customers because demand was high and it required less manual intervention. Citi declined to comment.  A Truist spokesman said that it handled PPP applications through a single portal on a first-come, first-served basis, \u201cwithout any preference to larger or more affluent clients.\u201d  JPMorgan declined to comment. PNC did not respond to requests for comment.  Bank groups pushed back on the House report. The Consumer Bankers Association said lenders were denied waivers that would have made it easier to lend to new borrowers, and that larger borrowers had dedicated staff and documentation that accelerated their applications.  \u201cWhen Congress, the SBA and Treasury designed the Paycheck Protection Program they prioritized getting money into the hands of small businesses very quickly, issuing confusing and changing operational and legal guidance for banks,\u201d said Greg Baer, CEO of the Bank Policy Institute.  REVIEWING PPP LOANS  People familiar with the situation say that virtually every large PPP lender, including JPMorgan, Citi, Truist and KeyBank, conducted standard internal reviews to spot violations by their own employees of program rules.  \u201cAs we participate in efforts to make critical government stimulus programs available ... we continue to execute on our controls to identify, address and report fraud,\u201d a Truist spokesman told Reuters via email.  KeyBank declined to comment.  Wells Fargo said in a May filing that it had received \u201cformal and informal inquiries from federal and state governmental agencies regarding its offering of PPP loans.\u201d  Wells Fargo spokesman Manny Venegas said the filing was referring to industry-wide inquiries from regulators over PPP fraud, which the bank had worked to spot and report. He declined to comment on whether the probes also concerned bank employees or processes.  Regulators have signaled there\u2019s much more to come. The SBA plans to review PPP loans over $2 million and its inspector general recently said there were \u201cstrong indicators of widespread potential abuse and fraud.\u201d  A recent U.S. House committee analysis found tens of thousands of PPP loans could be subject to fraud, waste, or abuse, including more than $1 billion in multiple loans to the same company, a violation of program rules.  James Stevens, an attorney who advises lenders at Troutman Pepper in Atlanta, said banks did their best to get money to needy small businesses, but that fast-changing program rules created \u201cfertile ground\u201d for fraud and internal errors.  \u201cRegulatory scrutiny of banks is always in hindsight,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come.\u201d","311":"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N is planning to eliminate about 700 workers in Manila, Philippines, and move a portion of these roles to India that already houses nearly 12,000 tech employees, the U.S. bank's spokesman said on Thursday.  The eliminations of the staff was earlier reported by Bloomberg, which also said the lender is telling about 650 of its tech workers in the United States that they will be required to relocate to a bigger market to keep their jobs.  The bank laid off more than 200 employees in its U.S. lending divisions in 2019, as it reacted to business trends and restructured some units, sources told Reuters in October.

The talks could still end without a deal, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.  Wells Fargo declined to comment. Chicago-based GTCR and New York-based Reverence did not respond to requests for comment.  The sale of the asset management business is one of many steps taken by Scharf to turn Wells Fargo around following a years-old sales practices scandal. He has been cutting costs and shedding noncore businesses. Earlier on Thursday, Wells Fargo announced a deal to sell its Canadian direct equipment finance business to Toronto-Dominion Bank.  Last month, Wells Fargo said it would sell its private student loan portfolio to a group of investors.  The bank is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, and Scharf is expected to unveil a new strategic plan for the bank.  Reverence Capital, co-founded by Goldman Sachs alum Milton Berlinski, and GTCR have been active in acquiring businesses in the asset management sector.  In 2019, Reverence bought 75% of Phoenix-based independent financial advisory firm Advisor Group Inc, while last year GTCR took a minority stake in Raleigh, North-Carolina\u2019s CAPTRUST Financial Advisors, which valued the registered investment adviser at $1.25 billion.","313":"WASHINGTON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has rejected Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s plans to prevent further consumer abuses and told the scandal-plagued lender it needs stronger checks on management, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.  The concerns raised by the Fed, which have not been previously reported, are likely to increase the time it takes the central bank to lift an asset cap it imposed on Wells Fargo in February following a string of sales practices scandals. The bank must draw-up a robust plan to improve its governance and risk management controls before the Fed will lift the cap and in February Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said the bank was \u201con the fast track\u201d to meeting those conditions.  Both the Fed and Wells Fargo declined to comment on the specifics of the review.  Wells Fargo subsequently submitted its plan in April expecting the Fed to sign-off on it over the summer, but the central bank instead told the country\u2019s fourth-largest lender to go back to the drawing board, the people said.  The settlement requires Wells Fargo to toughen board oversight, repay customers hurt by past abuses, and make more than 20 other improvements to its governance, risk management and compliance controls.  It also required the plan to be approved, implemented and an independent third-party review completed by Sept. 30, but the bank has missed this deadline, the people said.  That alone could have triggered further sanctions under the terms of the settlement, but the Fed has granted Wells Fargo more time to satisfy the February order, the sources said.  Wells Fargo executives and Fed officials have haggled for months over what controls are needed to make sure the bank can detect problems before they become full-blown scandals, the people said.  On Tuesday, Sloan told CNBC that the bank now expects the cap will be lifted in the first half of 2019, instead of this fall. He added that discussions with the Fed regarding the operational and risk compliance aspects of the plan were ongoing.  \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to make progress, but we need to demonstrate that we\u2019re deserving of the asset cap being lifted,\u201d Sloan said.  The bank told investors in May that it expected the asset cap to hurt profits by only $100 million.  Over the past nine months, Sloan has met several times with Fed Governor Lael Brainard to try and agree the specifics of the new plan, said two sources. Betsy Duke, a former Fed governor who now sits on the Wells Fargo board, has joined Sloan in those meetings, they added.  Reuters could not ascertain how close the two parties were to an agreement. However, even if the Fed blesses Wells Fargo\u2019s plan before year-end, the settlement still requires the bank to hire outside firms to perform an independent review of the bank\u2019s operations - work that is envisioned to take months.  In May, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said removal of the cap would also be put to a vote of the board of governors.","314":"April 13 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co:  * WELLS FARGO REPORTS PRELIMINARY FIRST QUARTER 2018 NET INCOME OF $5.9 BILLION; DILUTED EPS OF $1.12  * QTRLY PRELIMINARY REVENUE OF $21.9 BILLION, DOWN FROM $22.3 BILLION  * QTRLY PRELIMINARY FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY NEED TO BE REVISED TO REFLECT ADDITIONAL ACCRUALS FOR CFPB\/OCC MATTER  * PRELIM.

The Federal Reserve has signaled it is unlikely to raise interest rates in 2019 given risks to the U.S. economy from a global slowdown, which investors have feared could pressure net interest income, or the difference between what a bank earns on loans and pays on deposits.  The outlook overshadowed a jump in Wells Fargo\u2019s first-quarter profit, and comes as investors were already on edge following the abrupt departure of former Chief Executive Tim Sloan last month.  The bank has been working to keep a tight grip on costs as it continues to battle the fallout from a wide-ranging sales practices scandal that first erupted in 2016, efforts that helped its bottom line in the quarter as revenue slipped.  Interim CEO Allen Parker said on Friday he was working on improving relations with regulators and making the bank more efficient but acknowledged \u201cwe have more work ahead of us.\u201d  Analysts pushed Parker on why the bank was lowering its net interest income outlook while peers remained more optimistic, and for details on how non-interest-related revenues from fees would shape up.  \u201cIf the revenue base keeps splitting down, I\u2019m afraid that some of your loyal shareholders are going to start to exit before you have a new leadership in place,\u201d Bank of America analyst Erika Najarian said on a conference call to discuss results.  Parker said Wells Fargo\u2019s board is pressing forward with the CEO search, but has \u201ccomplete confidence\u201d with current leadership.  Finance chief John Shrewsberry reaffirmed that the lender was on track to hit its 2019 cost target. But the longer-term outlook is less certain, since the bank suspended its expense targets for 2020 after Sloan\u2019s exit.  Parker also did not give updated guidance for when a punitive asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve would be lifted, saying he felt it was not appropriate to do so.  Former CEO Sloan twice pushed back when he expected to get the cap removed, which the Fed says will happen when risk management and internal controls improve.  Shrewsberry said Wells Fargo expects a decline of 2 percent to 5 percent in net interest income this year from 2018. It previously forecast between a 2 percent rise and a 2 percent fall.  Wells Fargo\u2019s net interest income in the quarter fell 1 percent from a year earlier and 3 percent from the prior quarter.  The bank blamed the decline from the previous period on a flattening yield curve, even though JPMorgan Chase & Co earlier on Friday said higher rates helped boost its net interest income.  Wells Fargo shares were last down 3.2 percent.  COST CONTROLS  The bank\u2019s non-interest expenses fell 7.5 percent to $13.9 billion in the quarter from a year earlier. The company is targeting expenses for 2019 of $52 billion to $53 billion.  The decline in expenses outpaced a 1.5 percent fall in total revenue. As signs of a slowing U.S. economy mount, analysts have focused on efficiency in anticipation of slower revenue and loan growth. The lender\u2019s efficiency ratio, a closely watched measure of cost per dollar of revenue, improved from a year earlier but was higher than in the fourth quarter.  Average loans rose slightly from the prior quarter but were still below last year. Average deposits were down 1 percent from the previous quarter and fell 3 percent from a year earlier.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo bank sign is pictured in downtown Los Angeles, California, U.S. August 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Analysts were upbeat about the expense outlook, financial targets and lessened fallout from the regulatory restrictions, though Wells Fargo said that reflected slower loan and deposit growth. But some had hoped for more revenue details at the bank\u2019s annual investor day.  \u201cWhile we expect the market to view this financial outlook favorably, (portfolio managers) keep on telling us they need to see the negative headlines abate ... and revenue growth to return,\u201d Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg wrote in a note.  Wells Fargo is under Federal Reserve orders to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion until governance and controls improve. Chief Executive Tim Sloan said the bank, now the fourth-largest U.S. lender by assets, is making plans to operate under that limit for the first part of 2019.  He acknowledged the bank previously had not executed so well on compliance and risk oversight, but pushed back on the idea that it has a lot more work to do and said some news headlines were getting \u201ctiresome.\u201d  \u201cI think we\u2019re through most of the historical review,\u201d Sloan said during a question-and-answer period at the daylong meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina, which was webcast.  The bank previously expected the asset cap to hit after-tax net income by up to $400 million, but lower deposit and loan growth gave it room under the limit and caused it to cut that figure to less than $100 million, Treasurer Neal Blinde said.  Well Fargo said net interest income, or the difference in what it pays for deposits and what it earns on loans, will be relatively flat in 2018 as lower earning assets and higher deposit costs offset higher interest rates.  The bank\u2019s shares closed at $54.65 on Thursday, up 1.7 percent.  Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said the bank would not provide updated guidance on its efficiency ratio. Investors and analysts have watched for improvements in that key measure of costs per dollar of revenue since the sales scandal erupted in 2016.  Shrewsberry said under one scenario for 2020 it is possible the bank would have expenses of $50 billion to $51 billion, and revenue consistent with 2017 results, but cautioned that was not a formal projection.  Under questioning from analysts he declined to offer more specific revenue forecasts, citing the many variables at play.  Noninterest expenses for 2019 would total $52 billion to $53 billion excluding litigation and remediation items, the bank said, compared to analyst expectations of $53.2 billion according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Barclays analyst Goldberg noted that two profitability targets Wells Fargo gave on Thursday roughly met his expectations: a two-year return on equity of 12 percent to 15 percent and two-year return on average tangible common equity of 14 percent to 17 percent.  Perry Pelos, who leads Wells Fargo\u2019s wholesale business, said it remains the primary bank of about 11 percent of U.S. middle-market companies.

A Wells Fargo ATM machine is shown in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Wells Fargo has struggled to regain its footing since sales abuses came to light in that business more than two years ago, when the bank said employees had opened millions of fake accounts in customers\u2019 names without their permission.  Management has since centralized risk controls, overhauled employee compensation and pushed a renewed focus on customer wellness to address underlying problems.  Some of those changes are hurting revenue, executives acknowledged on Tuesday when discussing fourth-quarter results. For instance, the bank now sends customers real-time low balance alerts to protect them from overdraft fees.  Wells Fargo is also experiencing cyclical pressure in mortgage lending, which was once its main money-maker, and has intentionally pulled back from some areas, like auto lending, where executives felt profit potential was limited.  Combined with legal and regulatory penalties for its sales abuses, which also involved overcharging hundreds of thousands of customers on auto loans, mortgages and account features they did not request, the bank has struggled to get its profit engine humming again.  In lieu of revenue growth, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan has laid out an aggressive cost-cutting plan to buoy profits.  The bank\u2019s shares fell 1.5 percent to close at $47.67.  ASSET CAP  Sloan said on Tuesday he expects the Federal Reserve to maintain an asset cap on the bank through the remainder of the year.  The Fed imposed that penalty in February as punishment for the sales abuses, saying it would only be lifted once the bank proved it had fixed what was wrong.  Wells Fargo executives initially said the cap would not hinder the bank\u2019s business growth, and as recently as July predicted it would be lifted by mid-2019.  But progress has been slower than expected, Sloan said on a call with analysts, who peppered him with questions about the profit impact of the asset cap.  \u201cIt is hard not to feel like the regulatory penalty box is endless,\u201d said Brian Foran, an analyst with Autonomous Research.  The bank has already paid billions in combined fines and settlements with regulators and private litigants over its sales abuses, and remains on a tight leash with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as it continues remediation efforts.  Wells Fargo also faces probes from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  During the fourth quarter, the bank\u2019s loan book shrank 1 percent and deposits fell 3 percent. Consumer loans posted the biggest decline, hurt primarily by more people paying off their mortgages than taking out new ones. Mortgage banking revenue fell by half.  Wells Fargo\u2019s overall quarterly profit of $5.71 billion, or $1.21 per share, was down 1 percent from the $5.74 billion, or $1.16 per share, a year earlier.  Those results reflected special items including some $432 million in operating losses from legal costs, regulatory penalties and customer remediation, and a $614 million gain on the sale of troubled mortgage loans that predate the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.19 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue fell 5 percent to $20.98 billion, below Wall Street\u2019s $21.73 billion estimate.  Wells Fargo met Sloan\u2019s expense target last year when excluding big one-time items like legal costs, regulatory penalties and customer remediation expenses.  The bank is now aiming to slash expenses to a range of $52 billion to $53 billion this year, and $50 billion to $51 billion by 2020. Wells Fargo is on track to hit those goals through efficiency programs that will reduce overall headcount by 5 percent to 10 percent, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said.  Earlier in the day, JPMorgan Chase & Co reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and a slump in bond trading revenue.","324":"FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co is creating a new unit tasked with satisfying U.S. regulatory requirements, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.  Derek Flowers, who has been with the San Francisco-based bank for more than two decades, will become head of strategic execution and operations and will focus on the bank\u2019s regulatory priorities, said the memo, sent by interim chief executive Allen Parker on Wednesday.  In his current role as chief credit and market risk officer, Flowers would have had frequent contact with regulators.  The new unit, whose creation was reported earlier on Wednesday by the Financial Times, will be charged with working through the more than a dozen regulatory consent orders the bank is operating under - agreements between regulators and the bank that it will work to satisfy certain requirements. It will also implement new business and risk-management processes.  Parker has said he wants to \u201credouble\u201d the bank\u2019s efforts to satisfy and exceed regulatory expectations.  Regulators have demanded change from Wells Fargo after employee whistleblowers revealed it had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts in 2016.

The bank has said it is committed to compensating all customers affected by its actions and has so far payed out tens of millions of dollars.  However, regulators including the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have publicly criticized the bank\u2019s progress within the past month.  Wells Fargo has added more than 1,000 jobs to its risk management team and plans to add an additional 1,300 employees this year to help strengthen its compliance efforts, it has said.","325":"Wells Fargo & Co will pay $20 million to resolve claims that it misled investors about the quality of loans underlying toxic mortgage-backed securities that were at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis, Maryland\u2019s attorney general said Tuesday.

To read the full story on Westlaw Practitioner Insights, click here: bit.ly\/2zCbEwQ","326":"(Reuters) - In what appears to be the first class action settlement in a wave of noteholder suits against banks that served as trustees for mortgage-backed securities trusts, Wells Fargo agreed Friday to a $43 million deal to resolve claims by BlackRock, Pimco and other noteholders in 271 trusts that lost nearly $35 billion in the financial crisis. If the proposed settlement is approved by Manhattan State Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos, shareholders will also receive $70 million from an indemnity fund Wells Fargo reserved to litigate noteholder suits.  The question, of course, is what the settlement means in the larger context of MBS investor suits against the trustees they accuse of failing to protect noteholders when problems showed up in the home mortgage loans underlying the securities. As I\u2019ve written, these trustee suits are the last big tranche of MBS litigation by noteholders who lost untold billions of dollars in the MBS market. Should investors read the Wells Fargo settlement as a sign the hard-fought MBS trustee litigation is about to pay off or as an acknowledgment that their claims aren\u2019t very valuable?  I\u2019d say the latter is a better reading of the settlement than the former. The noteholders\u2019 lawyer who led the class action against Wells Fargo, Timothy DeLange of Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann didn\u2019t immediately respond to my email requesting comment, but he is actually quoted in the Wells Fargo press release announcing the deal. He didn\u2019t exactly crow about the result: \u201cFollowing more than four years of litigation, including fact and expert discovery, we concluded that this agreement provides a fair and reasonable resolution of the claims,\u201d DeLange said. \u201cWhile we believe the claims are meritorious, the settlement provides an immediate and concrete benefit for class members, while bringing the litigation to a close.\u201d  In the memo asking Judge Ramos to approve the deal, noteholders acknowledged some of the litigation setbacks investors have experienced in their suits against trustees. Although noteholders have broadly survived defense dismissal motions, post-dismissal rulings have turned the litigation into an expensive quagmire for investors. Class certification has been one big problem, with Manhattan federal judges issuing a series of rulings denying class certification to MBS noteholders because, according to the decisions, individual issues of standing and timeliness predominate over classwide concerns. (A BlackRock investors\u2019 class certification motion against Wells Fargo was pending before U.S. District Judge Katherine Failla of Manhattan when the two sides agreed to settle their parallel case in state court.)  Courts have also foreclosed evidentiary shortcuts for noteholders, ruling that noteholders must prove trustees were aware of problems in underlying mortgage pools on a loan-by-loan, trust-by-trust basis. Judges have generally refused to allow investors to prove deficiencies by extrapolating from a sample of underlying mortgage loans. And at least one judge, U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni of Manhattan, has ruled, on a summary judgment motion, that noteholders must show trustees had actual knowledge that individual underlying loans failed to live up to representations and warranties. (A New York state appeals court took an easier line on trustees\u2019 knowledge, concluding that investors need not allege trustees\u2019 actual knowledge on a loan-by-loan basis.)  Black Rock and the other noteholders suing Wells Fargo acknowledged their tough road ahead in the memo requesting settlement approval. \u201cTo defeat summary judgment and prevail at trial, plaintiffs would have been required to prove, among other things, that Wells Fargo discovered breaches of representations and warranties and had actual knowledge of servicing violations with respect to individual loans in the trusts,\u201d the memo said. \u201cWells Fargo would have had substantial arguments to make concerning each of these issues. For example, Wells Fargo would have argued that plaintiffs must prove, on a loan-by-loan basis, Wells Fargo\u2019s discovery of breaches of representations and warranties and actual knowledge of servicing violations. \u2026 In addition, Wells Fargo would have argued that any damages to plaintiffs and the class were caused by factors unrelated to the purported breaches of representations and warranties or servicing violations. Had any of these arguments been accepted in whole or in part, it could have eliminated or, at a minimum, drastically limited any potential recovery.\u201d  And based on sheer math, the settlement looks more like a business decision by Wells Fargo than an admission of the merits of claims that the bank failed to live up to its MBS trustee responsibilities. As I mentioned, the Black Rock investors alleged losses of nearly $35 billion across the 271 trusts covered by the settlement. Their amended complaint sought to hold Wells Fargo liable for all of those losses. Instead, the settlement is for only $42 million.  We can infer, moreover, that Wells Fargo expected the litigation to cost at least that much. Acting in its capacity as MBS trustee, the bank reserved about $90 million from MBS trusts to pay legal expenses stemming from its trustee duties. (BlackRock actually sued Wells Fargo over the reserve fund, asserting that the bank had looted trust assets, but Judge Ramos dismissed the suit in 2017.) By releasing $70 million of the reserve fund to investors as part of Friday\u2019s settlement, Wells Fargo effectively said it would have cost more to defend the Black Rock class action than to settle it.  It\u2019s worth pointing out that Wells Fargo kept $20 million in the reserve fund, presumably to fend off MBS trustee claims by investors in another 58 trusts. Based on the bank\u2019s per-trust payout in the BlackRock case, however, Wells Fargo\u2019s exposure in those cases is less than $10 million.  That calculation assumes Wells Fargo \u2013 as well as other MBS trustees such as Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bank and Deutsche Bank \u2013 will present the Black Rock class settlement as a ceiling for future settlements, not a floor. Individual noteholders may well balk at the idea that they\u2019re on par with the BlackRock group, some of whose affiliated investment advisors were facing third-party claims by Wells Fargo that they, and not the trustee, were responsible for MBS losses. Wells Fargo hasn\u2019t brought analogous third-party claims against the individual noteholders suing that bank as an MBS trustee.  I checked in with a plaintiffs' lawyer who represents individual certificate-holders in MBS trustee cases, David Wollmuth of Wollmuth Maher & Deutsch. Wollmuth client Phoenix Life reached a confidential settlement last month of claims against Bank of America, which had limited trustee duties in an MBS offering of more than $600 million. The settlement amount was not disclosed and Wollmuth said he could not comment on the agreement. But overall, he said, Phoenix continues to believe in the strength of its claims and is \u201cpleased at how the cases are progressing.\u201d  Wells Fargo is represented in the MBS trustee litigation by Jones Day.

REUTERS\/Bobby Yip  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bank of America is punching above Wells Fargo\u2019s weight.

In other words, it lagged its West Coast rival\u2019s performance, as it typically does \u2013 this time by a percentage point. Yet the two now trade at the same multiple of 1.65 times tangible book value, an implicit valuation premium for BofA. Boss Brian Moynihan\u2019s turnaround has taken shape over years. Tim Sloan at Wells may close the gap again before long.  There are a few similarities between Sloan and the BofA chief executive. Both ended up running their respective banks after a predecessor left under a cloud. Neither was considered the best person for the job. And each of them struggled to quickly control the various issues plaguing their franchises.  Moynihan, who took the reins at the $280 billion BofA in 2010, is now reaping the benefits of years spent overhauling the operation. He has been helped greatly by last year\u2019s U.S. tax cuts and the Federal Reserve\u2019s tightening of monetary policy \u2013 the bank was one of the best placed to benefit from rising interest rates. But he marshaled a solid set of businesses, pulled ahead of fellow laggard Citigroup, and now has the results to show for it.  The three months to the end of September may mark a turning point for the $250 billion Wells and Sloan. Deposits and loans are still declining, and the bank is still forbidden from growing its balance sheet thanks to a consent order from the Fed reflecting past failures in governance and risk management. But Sloan is now getting expenses under control, setting the bank up for a return to growth.  Still, it must smart a bit to be running a once-standout lender that investors now peg at the same price-to-tangible-book multiple as BofA, until two years ago regarded as one of the slowpokes of the industry. But if Moynihan managed to put BofA\u2019s past behind it, despite all the doubters, then perhaps Sloan can, too.","335":"June 29 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co:  * WELLS FARGO ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE\u2019S STRESS TEST FEEDBACK  * WELLS FARGO & CO - EXPECTS COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND IN Q3 2020 WILL BE REDUCED FROM CURRENT LEVEL OF $0.51 PER SHARE.  * WELLS FARGO & CO - EXPECTS THAT LEVEL OF Q3 DIVIDEND WILL BE ANNOUNCED WHEN IT RELEASES Q2 FINANCIAL RESULTS  * WELLS FARGO & CO - EXPECTS ITS STRESS CAPITAL BUFFER TO BE 2.5%  * WELLS FARGO & CO - THERE REMAINS GREAT UNCERTAINTY IN PATH OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY  * WELLS FARGO & CO - CO\u2019S \u201cECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS HAVE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE LAST QUARTER\u201d  * WELLS FARGO & CO - EXPECT Q2 RESULTS WILL INCLUDE INCREASE IN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN INCREASE IN Q1 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","336":"March 6 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co has agreed to publish a report investigating the root causes of systemic lapses that led to the sales scandal in September 2016, following pressure from an investor coalition.

Non-interest expenses in the third quarter fell 4.1 percent to $13.8 billion, in the first year-over-year decline this year.  Wells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. lender by assets, has vowed to chop billions of costs over the next several years. But costs for repaying customers it had previously overcharged and marketing costs to re-brand the company after a string of scandals have kept costs stubbornly high.  Wells has promised to reduce about $3 billion in expenses by 2020. It is closing roughly 800 branches and cutting up to 10 percent of its workforce over the next three years.  Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told reporters on a conference call that other opportunities to reduce costs include scaling back call center operations and non-customer-facing office space.  But even as profits soared due to the cost cuts and a lower tax rate, analysts raised concerns about the company\u2019s sluggish revenue and shrinking loan book.  Total loans fell 1 percent to $942.3 billion, and revenue inched 0.4 percent higher during the quarter. By comparison JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N reported a 5.2 percent increase in revenue and a 6 percent jump in average loan balances on Friday.  \u201cLoan and revenue growth remains challenged,\u201d said Kyle Sanders, an Edward Jones analyst, in a research note. \u201cThis trend could linger in the near term as Wells works to emerge from the Fed\u2019s asset growth cap and repair its reputation with consumers.\u201d  The Federal Reserve in February ordered Wells to keep its assets below $1.95 million until it had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practice scandals.  Chief Executive Tim Sloan said on a call with analysts he was hopeful that the bank would not have any new issues.  Analysts said the quarter\u2019s results show that Wells is making progress on cleaning up its previous scandals, though worries linger.  \u201cWhile these results were less noisy than previous quarters, more fallout from prior misdeeds cannot be ruled out,\u201d Allen Tischler, senior vice president with Moody\u2019s Investors Service, said.

The deal will enable the bank\u2019s customers to share their account information with fintech apps connected to Envestnet Yodlee.  Wells Fargo and other large U.S. banks have been pushing to move fintechs and data aggregators away from so-called screenscraping and towards what they have said is a more secure method of accessing sensitive data. Through screenscraping, fintechs collect information by logging into a user\u2019s bank account on their behalf.  \u201cThis is a significant milestone, we now have 99% of current third party app screenscraping under data exchange agreements,\u201d said Ben Soccorsy, senior vice president in Wells Fargo\u2019s strategy, digital and innovation group.  Fintech startups, such as those providing automated wealth management or budgeting tools, often need to connect to a user\u2019s bank account to gather the necessary data to provide their services. Some collect the information through aggregators such as Yodlee and competitor Plaid, while others request that customers provide their password to access their information.  Through Wells Fargo\u2019s new method, fintechs will not be able to use customers\u2019 passwords to access their entire financial data, but will instead connect to the bank\u2019s application programming interface, a set of programming code, that will only send specific account information authorized by the consumer.  The changes come as banks and fintechs scuffle over data access. Banks have said their reluctance to share customer information with third parties reflects a need to protect sensitive data. Fintechs have expressed skepticism, suggesting that consumers should decide who can access their data.  Soccorsy declined to say whether Envestnet Yodlee would be paying Wells Fargo for access to customer-permissioned data and said the bank could not disclose the details of any of these agreements as the terms are confidential.

Scharf\u2019s \u201creally changed the internal attitude to make improving the bank\u2019s governance the number one priority,\u201d Long said.  Scharf started making changes shortly after taking the helm in October 2019, though he has not yet provided firm targets or timelines for progress. He installed a slew of external leaders, overhauled the reporting segments, and began to shed non-core businesses. He also implemented weekly and monthly reviews to increase oversight and address regulator concerns more efficiently.  In a sign of progress repairing Wells Fargo\u2019s relationship with regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ended a consent order related to anti-money laundering compliance on the bank earlier this month.  But Wells\u2019 largest hurdles remain and it has a long way to go to catch up with peers. Efficiency ratios across Wells\u2019 largest business lines dramatically lag other big banks. Further, the ongoing need for spending to satisfy regulators and the presence of punitive asset cap until Wells proves it fixed the risk management failures that led to the widespread customer abuses will continue to hinder the bank\u2019s ability to compete effectively.  \u201cOther banks have not been operating under these consent orders so they\u2019ve been able to spend a good amount of their mindshare thinking about operating efficiency and the future,\u201d Long said. \u201cWells has not.\u201d","345":"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N is examining its wealth and investment management business for possible customer abuse, including overcharging and inappropriate referrals, after inquiries from government agencies, the company said on Thursday.

The U.S. Justice Department instructed Wells Fargo in late 2017 to investigate its wealth management business after whistleblowers accused the bank of pushing nonessential products or services on customers, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Thursday.  The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kathleen Leary directed Reuters to a statement by Chief Executive Tim Sloan, who said the review happened after inquiries from government agencies.  \u201cWhen we discover a problem, we are moving to find the root cause and fix it,\u201d Sloan said. He emphasized Wells Fargo\u2019s effort to be more transparent as it discovers new issues.  Wells Fargo has been embroiled in a sales-practice scandal in its retail operations for more than a year, primarily related to employees opening perhaps 3.5 million phony accounts in customers\u2019 names without their permission.  The bank also found evidence that some customer accounts were improperly closed, or their funds were improperly frozen, and that customers were enrolled in \u201cadd-on\u201d products like identity theft protection that they did not request.  Problems in other areas, including mortgage lending and auto insurance, also have surfaced through internal reviews and regulatory probes. But until now, Wells Fargo\u2019s wealth and investment management business had largely avoided scrutiny.  According to the filing, as part of its review of the wealth business, Wells found that some customers were overcharged for investment and fiduciary services due to \u201cincorrect set-up and maintenance in the system of record.\u201d The bank is now trying to determine the extent of the issue and causes of any problems in the unit, which generated $2.7 billion worth of profit last year.

REUTERS\/Chris Helgren  The settlement, in which Wells had received a preliminary approval in July last year, sets aside funds for compensating customers after the bank opened consumer or small business accounts, credit cards or lines of credit without their knowledge between 2002 and April 2017.  The United States\u2019 fourth-biggest bank is dealing with the fallout of two years of investigations, agreeing in April to pay $1 billion to settle with regulators who say it forced auto insurance on hundreds of thousands and routinely hit homebuyers with excessive fees.  Last month, the bank also agreed to pay $480 million to resolve a securities fraud lawsuit filed with the District Court for the Northern District of California which alleged the bank made certain misstatements and omissions in disclosures related to its sales practices.  Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said Friday\u2019s announcement was \u201ca significant step forward in making things right for our customers and restoring trust all of Wells Fargo\u2019s stakeholders.\u201d  Customers have until July 7 to claim money.  Announcing the settlement with regulators in August, the bank also said that the mortgage and auto programs together ensnared more than 600,000 customers and would require nearly $300 million in refunds.  Analysts worry the scandal has hurt Wells Fargo both by distracting executives with investigations and lawsuits, and through its impact on the bank\u2019s public image.  In February, the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed a consent order on Wells that restricted it to grow assets beyond the $1.95 trillion it had at the end of last year \u201cuntil it sufficiently improves its governance and controls.\u201d  Sloan, since then, has reassured shareholders numerous times that the bank was stable and \u201copen for business\u201d.

REUTERS\/Jeenah Moon  The country\u2019s fourth-largest bank, which has been plagued by hefty costs tied to litigation over the past several years, reported a drop in overall fourth-quarter expenses. But costs are still high due to a sales practices scandal that has haunted it since 2016.  Wells Fargo paid $321 million in customer remediation costs in the quarter, despite bank executives repeatedly signaling that the worst of the fallout, which has cost it billions, is in the past.  The company also took $781 million in restructuring charges as Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf takes tough measures to shift fortunes at the bank that he joined in 2019.  Scharf has targeted $10 billion in savings annually over the long term. The bank has also been offloading assets, including a possible sale of its asset management business to a private equity consortium.  Wells Fargo was once seen as the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of U.S. banks: it avoided the kind of problems that Wall Street rivals encountered during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  But it has operated under a dark cloud since 2016, when details emerged about millions of phony accounts employees had created in customers\u2019 names without their permission to hit sales targets.  There have been revelations about other customer abuses, and Wells Fargo has been unable to shake the damage caused by all the blunders.  \u201cOur results continued to be impacted by the unprecedented operating environment and the required work to put our substantial legacy issues behind us,\u201d Scharf said in a statement.  Wells Fargo is also constrained by growth restrictions the U.S. Federal Reserve placed on its balance sheet as punishment for the sales abuses.  \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the impact on our financial performance is material in this environment,\u201d Scharf said about the asset cap it operates under.  Because the bank does not have a large capital markets business like JPMorgan Chase or Citigroup Inc - which also reported results on Friday - it has fewer ways to cushion declines in revenue from low interest rates.  Total revenue fell 10% to $17.93 billion, missing average analyst estimates, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv. Net-interest income fell 17% to $9.28 billion in the quarter.  Shares of Wells Fargo were down more than 7% in morning trade after the bank warned 2021 net interest income would be flat to down 4% from the annualized fourth quarter 2020 level of $36.8 billion.  DEPOSITS LAG  Deposit growth has boomed across the industry as cautious consumers and companies save more and spend less during the pandemic. Wells Fargo added deposits at a much slower rate compared to peers.  Total deposits rose 4%, compared with a 20% jump at Citigroup and a 35% rise at JPMorgan.  The bank did manage some bright spots. It reported net income of $2.99 billion, or 64 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $2.87 billion, or 60 cents per share a year earlier.  Analysts had expected a profit of 60 cents on average. The bank missed estimates in the first three quarters of last year.  Costs pegged to bad loans fell $823 million compared to last year and remained far below the level seen in the first half of the year when the bank racked up more than $14 billion in provision expenses.  Wells Fargo said it expects total 2021 expenses of about $53 billion excluding one-off charges.","348":"FILE PHOTO: White House Chief of Staff William Daley listens as U.S. President Barack Obama (not pictured) answers a question at the APEC CEO Summit in Honolulu, Hawaii November 12, 2011.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo logo is seen at the SIBOS banking and financial conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada October 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Chris Helgren\/File Photo  The penalty would be the first issued by Mick Mulvaney, whom President Donald Trump tapped in November to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  The fine would fulfill Trump\u2019s vow to come down hard on the country\u2019s third-largest lender, which has been grappling with a sales practices scandal since September 2016.  The CFPB is readying sanctions alongside the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Wells Fargo\u2019s day-to-day regulator. The agencies are ready to sanction Wells Fargo for layering extra insurance on drivers and collecting commissions on those policies, Reuters reported last month.  Both agencies have also been investigating the bank for wrongly levying fees on mortgage borrowers.  Mulvaney is eyeing a penalty that would settle both those matters and dwarf the $100 million the CFPB fined Wells Fargo in September 2016 to settle its phony accounts scandal, said the sources familiar with the talks. That 2016 fine had been the CFPB\u2019s largest ever.  Settlement terms have not been finalized but Mulvaney is pushing for a figure as high as $1 billion, said three people with knowledge of the discussions.  A stiff penalty against Wells Fargo could burnish Mulvaney\u2019s image as a tough regulator even as his agency has dropped cases against at least two payday lenders.  Mulvaney has said the CFPB has gone too far in policing industry in the past but that abuses do exist.  \u201cI think you\u2019re being na\u00efve if you think there aren\u2019t folks out there who are breaking consumer financial protection laws,\u201d Mulvaney told an industry meeting last month.  The OCC and Wells Fargo declined to comment. A spokesman for the CFPB did not respond to a request for comment.  Lawmakers will get a chance to question Mulvaney about the settlement talks at two separate hearings in Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. Wells Fargo is due to report earnings on Friday and some officials hoped to have a deal by then.  Mulvaney was asked about the Wells Fargo matter at an industry event on Monday and declined to comment.  In the case of Wells Fargo and auto insurance, agency lawyers have raised concerns about how different customers received different treatment from the bank.  Drivers who financed a car through a dealer could be pushed into insurance if Wells Fargo suspected a policy had lapsed. Drivers who went directly to the bank for a loan were not subject to such \u201cforce-place\u201d insurance after 2011, the bank has said.  The bank has also said it did not monitor insurance for borrowers with high credit scores. Borrowers with lower credit scores could get pushed into force-placed insurance.  Lawyers are debating whether the bank should pay a higher fine for the uneven treatment of customers, the sources said.  Trump had pledged tough penalties for Wells Fargo after Reuters reported in December that Mulvaney put the mortgage-lending abuse sanctions on ice.","350":"NEW YORK, Sept 16 (LPC) - Wells Fargo has hired Thomas Tuffy Joao, a spokesperson from the US bank confirmed.

Ninety percent of Wells Fargo\u2019s workforce is U.S.-based, and the company currently has 17,000 open positions domestically, spokesman Kurt Schroeder said in a statement. However, he said, employees abroad are needed in order to meet the demands of customers who need round-the-clock support.  \u201cWells Fargo has a long history and strong commitment to a work force that is predominantly U.S.-based,\u201d he said.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith  Though protesters and activists dominated most of the meeting, the shareholder vote reflected growing investor confidence in management. All the directors were elected with no less than 95 percent approval, according to the preliminary tally. A year ago, directors were elected with 89 percent approval.  The majority of the San Francisco-based bank\u2019s 12 board members joined Wells Fargo after the bank became mired in scandal in late 2016 for opening potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. Board Chair Betsy Duke and interim Chief Executive Allen Parker faced questions about why investors should vote for the five directors who were at the bank at the time of the wrongdoing.  Last month, proxy research firm Institutional Shareholder Services advised \u201ccautionary support\u201d of directors who were at the bank prior to 2017.  About 15 activists were kicked out of the meeting for interrupting Parker\u2019s remarks, as part of coordinated demonstrations by the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA). Parker had repeatedly asked them to wait for the question-and-answer segment before having security evict them.  \u201cOne of the wonderful things about shareholder democracy is that we have meetings like this,\u201d said Parker as the activists were escorted out.  NACA CEO Bruce Marks, who has a history of protesting at bank shareholder meetings, helped members buy individual shares so they could attend the meeting, he told Reuters.  The group, a non-profit mortgage broker, plans to attend Bank of America Corp\u2019s shareholder meeting on Wednesday to thank the bank for committing billions of dollars to low- and moderate-income mortgages.  The demonstrators spoke about fair lending practices, African American homeownership and fake accounts. Some called Wells Fargo executives \u201cfrauds\u201d and said the bank could not be trusted.  Wells Fargo\u2019s annual meetings have drawn protesters every year since its fake account scandal in 2016. Since the initial revelations, regulators and the bank have uncovered problems in each of the bank\u2019s primary business segments. The scandals at the fourth-largest U.S. lender have resulted in billions of fines and penalties and claimed two CEOs after Tim Sloan announced his resignation last month.  Board Chair Duke said at the meeting Tuesday a search for an external candidate is underway and that the board would not comment on the search process until a selection is finalized.  Shareholders also approved executive pay and other management proposals. Two shareholder proposals that were rejected called for transparency about incentive pay and closing of the median gender pay gap.","363":"Sept 27 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co on Friday named Charles Scharf, the chief executive officer of Bank of New York Mellon, to its top job.

The new structure, which increases the bank's business lines to five from three, closely resembles that of JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, where Scharf was mentored by CEO Jamie Dimon earlier in his career.

FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo ATM machine is shown in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Executives warned on a call with analysts that expenses will come in at the high end of its forecasted range for 2019 and that 2020 expenses will likely be flat with 2019, instead of lower as previously expected.  Lower costs were a primary driver of earnings in the most recent quarter and were a cornerstone of former CEO Tim Sloan\u2019s plan to deliver higher profits while the bank worked on moving past its scandals. The bank\u2019s new strategy shows the two goals may have been incompatible.  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a greater need for us to make investments in terms of risks, compliance and audit, all those things that we\u2019re going to need to make investments in, in order to satisfy the requirements of our regulators,\u201d said Interim Chief Executive Allen Parker.  Parker was thrust into the job in March when former CEO Tim Sloan resigned abruptly, saying pressure from politicians and regulators had become a distraction in running the scandal-plagued bank.  Wells Fargo has been under a regulatory microscope since revelations that the bank had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts in 2016. Internal and regulatory probes have since discovered other issues in each of the bank\u2019s primary segments, resulting in billions of dollars in fines, penalties and an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve.  During his tenure so far, Parker has prioritized resolving lingering issues from the bank\u2019s scandals. In May, he formed a new unit tasked with satisfying U.S. regulatory requirements.  The bank has hired thousands of employees to focus on risk controls and those personnel expenses have partially offset the bank\u2019s other cost-saving initiatives like headcount reductions in other areas of the bank and branch closures, said Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry.  The fourth largest U.S. bank by assets, has leaned on cost cuts to stabilize its bottom line amid sluggish revenue trends in the wake of its scandals. Now the San Francisco-based bank must also contend with fresh macroeconomic uncertainty from a changing interest rate environment that\u2019s pressuring lending margins across the industry. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut rates later this month.  Wells Fargo became the third big bank to report contracting net interest margins, a closely watched metric that measures the difference between how much a bank is charging on its loans and how much it pays for deposits. The figure dropped 11 basis points to 2.82% in the most recent quarter.  Wells Fargo has cut its net interest income guidance twice to reflect the broader economic outlook. Wells Fargo relies heavily on interest rates to pad its revenue since it has tons of rate sensitive deposits and mortgage securities.  Still, The bank showed that it was it was able to grow its loan book despite macroeconomic headwinds.
