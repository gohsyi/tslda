But a lower dose of the drug, tanezumab, failed to alleviate pain when compared with a placebo, the companies said in a statement.  The drug was being tested in patients who had already used three different classes of painkillers but had not experienced enough relief or were intolerant to those treatments.  Tanezumab belongs to a category of pain medications that target the nerve growth factor, a protein involved in the growth of nerve cells.  U.S. health regulators have been encouraging the development of such pain medicines rather than opioids, as the United States faces an epidemic of opioid use and abuse.  Chronic low back pain affects an estimated 33 million Americans and is a leading cause of disability, Pfizer and Lilly said. Treatment often requires painkillers such as codeine, in cases where over-the-counter medication does not help.  Last year, the two companies reported positive results from a late-stage study testing tanezumab in patients with osteoarthritis pain of the knee or hip.","4":"FILE PHOTO: Boxes of the drug trulicity, made by Eli Lilly and Company, sit on a counter at a pharmacy in Provo, Utah, U.S. January 9, 2020.

The Indianapolis-based drugmaker said it immediately hired external counsel to conduct an independent probe after it was made aware of the allegations. The investigation revealed consensual though inappropriate personal communications between Smiley and certain Lilly employees.  Lilly said the behavior exhibited poor judgment by Smiley. The company would not give further details on the communications or the number of employees involved.  Reuters could not immediately reach Smiley for comment. A LinkedIn search showed Smiley\u2019s account, which he managed himself, was no longer available.

The drug, Olumiant, was approved to treat adults with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to commonly-used treatments known as TNF inhibitors.

The decision comes after an independent advisory panel to the agency voted in favor of the lower, 2-milligram dose of Olumiant in April, and against the 4-milligram dose, citing safety concerns.  \u201cThe Olumiant approval was a bit worse than the panel\u2019s recommendation,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger said, noting that the vote in favor was for patients who were resistant to methotrexate, another commonly used rheumatoid arthritis treatment.

FILE PHOTO: The logo and ticker for Eli Lilly and Co. are displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 18, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Lilly has been banking on newer drugs such as psoriasis treatment Taltz and migraine treatment Emgality to grow revenue and help offset pricing pressures and sales declines for other products. However, sales of both fell short of Wall Street estimates in the quarter.  Emgality, which won U.S. approval late last year, brought in sales of just about $14 million, half of what analysts were expecting, as a program that allows patients to try newer drugs at little or no cost limited sales revenue.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of programs in place to bridge patients who may not have adequate insurance coverage or are in a high deductible phase of their plan. It\u2019s having a negative headwind,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Joshua Smiley told Reuters.  Similar new migraine treatments from Amgen Inc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries have created fierce early competition and allows insurers and pharmacy benefit mangers (PBMs) to demand steep discounts to cover them, a Reuters analysis showed.  Smiley said about two thirds of Emgality prescriptions were being reimbursed. \u201cJust based on the access decisions that PBMs and insurers have made, we expect that number to increase throughout the year,\u201d he said.  Lilly said it expects Emgality to overtake Amgen\u2019s Aimovig in new prescriptions in the current quarter.  Amgen on Tuesday reported first-quarter Aimovig sales of $59 million, below Wall Street estimates of $83.3 million.  Lilly also cited a number of other near-term challenges it faces, such as cheap generic competition for erectile dysfunction treatment Cialis, the recent global withdrawal of cancer drug Lartruvo after it failed to prove its benefit in a confirmatory clinical trial, and intense political pressure to lower insulin prices.  Lilly plans to offer a half-priced version of its widely-used Humalog insulin.  Eli Lilly shares closed down 2.1 percent at $117.04.  Trulicity sales of $879.7 million in the quarter fell well short of Wall Street estimates of $952 million, while sales of $252.5 million for Taltz also fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates.  Lilly said it now expects 2019 revenue of between $22 billion and $22.5 billion, down from its prior forecast of $25.1 billion to $25.6 billion. The forecast takes into account the spin-off of animal health unit, Elanco.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.33 per share, 2 cents higher than the average analyst estimate of $1.31, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue rose nearly 3 percent to $5.09 billion, but missed Wall Street estimates of $5.13 billion.","14":"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said on Monday it had started an early-stage trial to test its potential treatment for COVID-19, in the world\u2019s first study of an antibody treatment against the disease.  Lilly is one of the several drugmakers and research institutions that are working on vaccines, antivirals and other treatments to help those infected with the fast-spreading novel coronavirus, which has already killed over 370,000 worldwide.  An antiviral drug from Gilead Sciences called remdesivir has shown some promise against COVID-19 and is being given to patients by some countries under compassionate or emergency use rule.  Lilly said its early stage study will assess safety and tolerability in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and results are anticipated by the end of June.  The experimental treatment, LY-CoV555, has been developed through collaboration with privately held AbCellera Biologics, which Lilly partnered with in March.  Lilly\u2019s treatment is an antibody directed against the spike-shaped protein structures of the virus and is designed to block it from locking on to human cells, thus neutralizing the virus.  The drugmaker said the antibody treatment was developed after it was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from the lung illness caused by the new coronavirus.  Lilly said it expects to move into the next phase of testing, studying the potential treatment in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, if the drug is shown to be safe.  Rival Regeneron Pharmacuticals Inc has said it plans to start clinical studies in June to test its antibody cocktail treatment for the new coronavirus and is aiming to have hundreds of thousands of preventative doses available by the end of August.

As part of the deal, Lilly said it will make antibody therapies available to lower-income countries prior to April 2021, but did not elaborate on the number of doses. Separately, Fujifilm Holdings Corp 4901.T said its facility in Denmark would manufacture treatments next year.  Lilly had previously said it would make one million doses of its single antibody treatment available by the end of the year, and another 50,000 doses of its dual-antibody therapy by the fourth quarter this year.  Lilly said its partners with which it is developing antibody therapies, including Canadian biotech company AbCellera Biologics Inc, had agreed to waive their royalties on the therapies distributed in low- and middle-income countries.  The drugmaker in September partnered with Amgen Inc AMGN.O to increase supply of its antibody therapies, a day after data showed that Lilly's single antibody therapy, LY-CoV555, helped cut hospitalization and emergency room visits for COVID-19 patients.  Fujifilm said in a statement it expects to begin manufacturing of Lilly\u2019s antibody therapy in April 2021. In June, the company said its subsidiary Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies would double capacity at its Danish facility, which it has pledged to use in making COVID-19 treatments.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The Indianapolis-based drugmaker has been banking on newer drugs such as Trulicity and psoriasis therapy Taltz as it faces competition from cheap generic versions of erectile dysfunction treatment Cialis and other older medicines.  Demand for Trulicity remained strong in the third quarter, but profits were crimped by high rebates or discounts that drugmakers pay to middlemen such as pharmacy benefit managers in order to make sure patients have access to their products.  Trulicity sales rose 24% to $1.01 billion, short of Wall Street expectations of $1.08 billion, according to Refinitiv data. It had a net price decline of about 5% during the quarter.  Citi analyst Andrew Baum said Trulicity sales were likely hurt by Lilly's efforts to defend its market share against the upcoming launch of a rival drug from Denmark's Novo Nordisk A\/S NOVOb.CO.  Novo Nordisk, the world\u2019s biggest insulin maker, recently won approval for its once-daily oral diabetes pill Rybelsus, which is expected to be embraced by patients with an aversion to needles used to deliver Trulicity and other diabetes treatments.

Sales of Taltz rose nearly 29% to $340 million, but also missed analysts\u2019 estimates of $395.7 million.  Prices of drugs sold in the United States were also hurt by increased discounts offered to offset coverage gaps in the government Medicare healthcare program. The company said it expects the impact to diminish in the fourth quarter.  Overall revenue rose 3.2% to $5.48 billion, just shy of expectation of $5.50 billion.

With the acquisition, Lilly gets Dermira\u2019s experimental treatment for atopic dermatitis, a common form of eczema, which is in late-stage testing, as well as an approved medicated cloth for excessive armpit sweating.  Dermira gained some rights to the eczema drug, lebrikizumab, in 2017 from Roche AG ROG.S, and last year signed a deal with Almirall SA ALM.MC for an option to license European rights to the drug.  If approved, lebrikizumab would compete with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O and Sanofi SA's SASY.PA Dupixent, with some analysts forecasting peak sales upwards of $600 million in 2027.  The drug, which belongs to a class of treatments known as monoclonal antibodies, would add to Lilly\u2019s immunology treatments, including the psoriasis treatment Taltz.  Last year Eli Lilly paid out a hefty sum of $8 billion for Loxo Oncology Inc for its pipeline of cancer drugs that target rare genetic mutations.  Lilly has been focused on increasing sales in core franchises such as cancer, as sales of its older blockbuster medicines such as diabetes treatment Humalog face pressure from generic competition.  \u201cThe acquisition of Dermira is consistent with Lilly\u2019s strategy to augment our own internal research by acquiring clinical phase assets,\u201d said Patrik Jonsson, president of Lilly Bio-Medicines.  Lilly is also testing another drug, Olumiant or baricitinib, as a treatment for atopic dermatitis.  Evercore was the exclusive financial adviser for Lilly, while Dermira\u2019s financial advisers were SVB Leerink and Citi, the lead adviser.","20":"July 11 (Reuters) - Drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co said on Thursday Christi Shaw, president of its bio-medicines business, would leave the company at the end of next month.

Novo Nordisk, the world\u2019s biggest insulin maker, launched Ozempic, known generically as semaglutide, in the United States this year after it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December.  Ozempic is a once-weekly injection that Novo Nordisk hopes will take market share from Trulicity, which has been cutting into sales of Novo Nordisk\u2019s once-daily Victoza.  The drug has now been included on a 2018 formulary list of acceptable medicines drawn up by Express Script, one of the biggest pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the United States, with a tier 3 status, a Novo spokeswoman told Reuters.  It is crucial for Novo Nordisk to have its drugs included on the PBM lists, as they account for around 80 percent of U.S. drug sales.  Ozempic will compete with Trulicity as well as AstraZeneca Plc\u2019s once-weekly Bydureon in a class known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs, which imitate an intestinal hormone that stimulates the production of insulin.  Being on the Express Script formulary list will give Ozempic access to a \u201csingle-digit share\u201d of the overall GLP-1 market in the United States, the spokeswoman said.  The U.S. market accounts for around half of Novo\u2019s total sales and pricing pressures in the U.S. drugs market hurt Novo Nordisk\u2019s profits in the fourth quarter.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Lilly is seen on a wall of the Lilly France company unit, part of the Eli Lilly and Co drugmaker group, in Fegersheim near Strasbourg, France, February 1, 2018. Picture taken February 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler  First-quarter revenue got a nearly $250 million boost from stockpiling of Lilly\u2019s insulin products, Trulicity and psoriasis drug Taltz. However, this benefit would largely be reversed over the course of 2020, the company said.  Lilly raised the top end of its full-year adjusted profit forecast by 10 cents, citing increased demand for its newer drugs, and now expects to earn $6.70 to $6.90 per share.  It said it expects clinical trials delayed by the pandemic to resume in the second half of the year.  The company also noted that staggeringly high U.S. unemployment rates could force more Americans to shift from commercial health insurance to federal programs or become uninsured. Some 26.5 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits over the last five weeks as efforts to curb the spread of the virus shuttered businesses and schools across the country.  As patients shift to Medicaid - the federal and states-run plan for low-income individuals - Lilly could see lower payments for its drugs, Chief Executive Officer David Ricks told Reuters, adding that the hit would be more pronounced in 2021.  The company said 10% of its customers were on Medicaid, while 40% were commercially insured.  Long-term unemployment rates would lower Medicaid reimbursement for Lilly\u2019s key drugs, said Citi analyst Andrew Baum, adding that there are cheaper alternatives to Trulicity and Taltz.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking at everything we can do to ensure that people can stay on our medications and have access to them, and believe that some of these impacts will be temporary,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Joshua Smiley said.  Earlier this month, Lilly capped out-of-pocket costs for insulin products, including widely-used Humalog, at $35 per month.  Lilly is also working on potential treatments for the coronavirus. It has begun testing its new rheumatoid arthritis drug Olumiant for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. It is also conducting trials on an experimental biotech drug in pneumonia patients, among other efforts. The virus attacks the lungs and causes pneumonia in severe cases.  Trulicity sales jumped 40% to $1.23 billion, helping drive a 15% rise in total quarterly revenue to $5.86 billion. That topped Wall Street estimates of $5.51 billion.

The logo of Lilly is seen on a wall of the Lilly France company unit, part of the Eli Lilly and Co drugmaker group, in Fegersheim near Strasbourg, France, February 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler  No new U.S. patients will be started on the drug and Lilly is suspending promotion of the medicine, the company said.  Lartruvo won accelerated approval in 2016 in the United States and conditional approval in Europe based on results from a promising mid-stage trial. But its continued approval was contingent on the results of a larger, late-stage trial confirming the drug\u2019s benefits.  On Friday, Lilly said Lartruvo combined with the standard-of-care chemotherapy doxorubicin did not prolong survival more than doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma.  Lilly oncology chief Anne White said in a phone interview the results were \u201ccompletely unexpected.\u201d  The disappointing outcome reflects the risk involved when drugs are approved based on smaller trials with promising data.  \u201cIn a sense, this is the way it\u2019s supposed to work,\u201d White said. \u201cYou do that confirmatory study. Obviously, there are times when it doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d  Lartruvo will continue to be available to patients who appear to be benefiting from it as global regulators determine the next steps for the treatment, White said.  The Lartruvo news is a major setback to Lilly\u2019s efforts to significantly boost its presence in oncology, as evidenced by its announcement last week that it would buy Loxo Oncology Inc for $8 billion to acquire its cancer drugs that target rare genetic mutations.  Analysts had forecast 2019 Lartruvo sales of $374.50 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Lilly in the past had avoided large deals, preferring to develop its own drugs. But the Loxo deal, the biggest acquisition in Lilly\u2019s 143-year history, followed last year\u2019s $1.6 billion purchase of Armo Biosciences, a developer of immunotherapy drugs.  \u201cGiven Lilly\u2019s strategic focus on oncology, this increases the probability that Lilly will make more oncology acquisitions to improve scale,\u201d BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said of the Lartruvo setback in a research note.  Lilly expects to take a first-quarter pretax charge of $70 million to $90 million, or about 10 cents per share, after tax, and said the setback will cut about 17 cents per share from its full-year 2019 earnings forecast.

REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler  Lilly and Bristol are the biggest drugmakers yet to announce clinical trial delays in the face of the pandemic that has killed over 16,000 people worldwide, after several small biotech companies said last week that they would be pulling back on drug studies.  The moves are not related to clinical trials testing drugs or vaccines that could be used to treat or prevent COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week urged switching to virtual patient visits instead of in-person monitoring when conducting clinical studies as it anticipated the outbreak would disrupt them.  Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co, AbbVie Inc, and Johnson & Johnson were not immediately available for comment on their trials policies.  Delaying clinical trials could hurt future revenue for pharmaceutical companies as it lengthens the time it takes for drugs to receive approval and reach the market. It could also hurt patients by limiting their access to experimental treatments being studied.  Lilly said the move would delay the timeline for ongoing late-stage studies of its experimental gastrointestinal disease treatment mirikizumab.  The Indianapolis-based drugmaker said there will not be any delay in other ongoing late-stage trials.  It added that it would analyze ongoing trials on a study-by-study basis, as discontinuing them would disrupt the treatment course for patients. But it plans to continue most trials where patients are already enrolled.  Lilly said it does not anticipate any change to its full-year financial forecast as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.  Bristol posted a message to clinical trial investigators on its website on Friday, saying it will put off beginning new clinical trials for at least three weeks because of the impact of the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic.  The New York-based drugmaker said it will not initiate any new sites for clinical trials until April 13, noting that the timeframe of the halt could extend further.  It also said studies involving healthy volunteers should be put on hold if they are at a natural break point until at least April 13.  Bristol did not say how many trials or which drugs in development might be affected.  FINANCIAL COST TO HOSPITALS  Conducting clinical trials is a good source of revenue for non-profit and academic hospitals, but are not as significant for for-profit hospital companies, Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said.  Large publicly listed hospital operators in the United States include HCA Healthcare, Tenet Healthcare Corp and Community Health Systems.  Lost revenue from clinical studies can directly impact staffing and operations as sites are usually paid per visit, according to Nariman Nasser, an executive at Continuum Clinical, an industry consultant that works with trial sites.  Large hospitals and academic centers also stand to lose fees that cover costs for things like building space, maintenance and operating costs, Nasser said in an email.  Last week, U.S.-based Iveric Bio Inc delayed enrollment in a trial of its eye disease drug, two days after Provention Bio paused a study of a diabetes drug but allowed trial patients to complete their treatment course.","37":"FILE PHOTO: Eli Lilly logo is shown on one of the company's offices in San Diego, California, U.S., September 17, 2020.

Lilly has been banking on drugs such as Trulicity and Taltz as it faces competition from cheap generic versions of its older medicines.

The trial is one of several efforts by the U.S. drugmaker to help combat the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 400,000 people globally, according to a Reuters tally.  The drug is being tested to see if it can reduce deaths from the COVID-19 illness and lessen its severity. Scientists at Lilly believe that baricitinib could help suppress a potentially lethal immune response to COVID-19 called \u201ccytokine storm\u201d and reduce COVID-19\u2019s ability to reproduce in infected cells.  The trial began dosing patients last week and plans to enroll around 400 patients globally. Lilly could potentially obtain U.S. regulatory approval for the drug as soon as August, Patrik Jonsson, the president of Lilly Bio-Medicines, told Reuters in an interview.  Lilly has also been working with the National Institutes of Health to study baricitinib, which is branded Olumiant, in a pairing with Gilead Sciences Inc\u2019s antiviral drug remdesivir. That study began enrolling patients last month.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Gilead\u2019s remdesivir emergency use authorization (EUA) last month, citing results from a U.S. government study that showed the drug reduced hospitalization stays by 31%, or about four days, compared to a placebo.  Lilly could potentially receive approval to use baricitinib in combination with remdesivir by as early as July, Jonsson said.  Seperately, Lilly could have an drug specifically designed to treat COVID-19 authorized for use as early as September if all goes well with either of two antibody therapies it is testing, its chief scientist told Reuters last week.","49":"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co will move a new COVID-19 antibody therapy to human trials targeting a coronavirus variant that was first found in South Africa, the U.S. drugmaker said on Tuesday.

Bamlanivimab was authorized in November for emergency use in high-risk patients in the United States with mild to moderate COVID-19. Lilly has requested emergency use authorization for the combination as well.  The new antibody targeting the South Africa variant is swiftly moving toward human testing, according to a company executive. How much data is needed each time a new antibody is made remains unresolved, he said.  There has been considerable concern in recent weeks after highly transmissible new variants of the coronavirus were found in the United Kingdom and South Africa, raising alarm that current drugs and vaccines might be rendered less effective.  \u201cAccording to all of the publicly available surveillance... bamlanivimab alone is effective, or predicted to be effective against more than 99% of all strains that we see in the United States today.

Data from over 1,000 participants in a late-stage study testing the combination showed 11 COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths in patients treated with the therapy, compared with 36 in those on placebo, representing a 70% risk reduction, the company said.  Antibody therapies from Lilly and rival Regeneron have so far seen lackluster demand as they require quick diagnosis and the isolation of infectious patients.

However, the inhibitors have been linked to the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in higher doses.  DKA, an inherent complication associated with type 1 diabetes, is a life-threatening condition in which acids called ketones build up when the body starts to use fat instead of glucose as a source of energy.  The drug, empagliflozin, was approved in 2014 in doses of 10 mg and 20 mg to help lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, and is marketed as Jardiance.  The increased risk of DKA was highlighted during an FDA advisory committee meeting on Sanofi SA and Lexicon Pharmaceuticals\u2019 sotagliflozin, an SGLT1 and SGLT2 dual inhibitor, following which the health regulator declined to approve the treatment.  The FDA is yet to take a decision on empagliflozin\u2019s use in type 1 diabetes. While the agency is not bound to follow the recommendation of its advisory panels, it usually does so.

REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler  Major drugmakers including Lilly, a leading producer of insulin, have come under fire from patients and lawmakers over the rising cost of the life-saving medication used to treat diabetes.  U.S. senators last week grilled executives from major drug companies, calling their pricing practices \u201cmorally repugnant\u201d.  Lilly\u2019s rebranded product will be called Insulin Lispro, while Humalog, which makes $3 billion in annual sales, will remain available for those wishing to access it through existing insurance plans.  The cost of insulin for treating type 1 diabetes in the United States has nearly doubled over a five-year period, leading some patients to put their own health at risk by rationing the medication.  The list price for Lilly\u2019s authorized generic, to be sold only in the United States, will be $137.35 per vial.  \u201cToday\u2019s announcement indicates that Lilly has calculated that the resultant impact of the introduction is at worst, economically neutral with the potential for material political gain,\u201d Citi analyst Andrew Baum said.  Two senators last month launched an investigation into rising insulin prices, writing to Lilly and other leading manufacturers, asking them why the cost of the nearly 100-year-old medication had rapidly risen.  The price of Lilly\u2019s Humalog rose from $35 to $234 per dose between 2001 and 2015, a 585 percent increase, the senators, Republican Chuck Grassley and Democrat Ron Wyden, had said.  Grassley on Monday called Lilly\u2019s announcement \u201cgood news\u201d in a Twitter post but added it was \u201conly 1 piece of puzzle\u201d and more needed to be done. Wyden said via email that Lilly\u2019s move would be a part of the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s investigation.  Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi SA, two other major insulin producers, told Reuters they were already taking steps to make insulin more affordable.  Novo said it was offering insulin at $25 per vial at many national pharmacy chains and had a program to help uninsured patients. Its insulin has a list price of $137.70.  Sanofi said its insulin products were provided to uninsured or commercially insured patients for half their list price under a program launched last year.  Lilly has in the past called insulin a highly-rebated product. Drugmakers often argue they have to keep prices high because of rebates or after market-discounts they must pay to pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers to get products on their lists of covered drugs.  The U.S. government in January proposed a rule to end the industry-wide system of rebates, a change that Lilly says it would welcome.","59":"FILE PHOTO: Eli Lilly logo is shown on one of the company's offices in San Diego, California, U.S., September 17, 2020.

Feng Hui, chief operating officer at Junshi said in a call with investors on Friday that the monkeys used to evaluate the safety of drugs and how they work in living systems before they can be tested in humans had been in tight supply between February and June, partly because of competing research by firms and institutes into COVID-19 treatments.  As his company prioritised finding enough animals on which to test the antibody treatment, it delayed applications for clinical trials of some of its non-coronavirus drugs in the pipeline, Feng said.  It had originally planned to file applications for clinical trials of those drugs in the second half of this year but the schedule is now pushed back to the first quarter of 2021, he added, without elaborating on how many and which drugs were involved.  \u201cOverall the firm\u2019s research and development progress is smooth,\u201d Feng said.

The doses will be delivered through Jan. 31, with at least 350,000 delivered in December, the company said.  The experimental drug has been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use for helping newly-diagnosed, high-risk patients avoid hospitalization, and the government bought 300,000 doses in October.  The new purchase is part of a U.S. government deal to secure nearly 1 million doses of Lilly\u2019s bamlanivimab, a treatment similar to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc\u2019s COVID-19 antibody therapy that U.S. President Donald Trump received in October during his illness.  The treatments belong to a class of drugs called monoclonal antibodies that are manufactured copies of antibodies created by the body to fight against an infection.  U.S. hospitals said in November they may limit use of Lilly\u2019s drug to COVID-19 patients with multiple risk factors for serious illness or to those whose immune systems have not begun to fight the infection due to high demand and tight supplies.

Data in September showed that Lilly\u2019s single antibody therapy, LY-CoV555, which is being developed with Canadian biotech AbCellera, helped cut hospitalization and emergency room visits for COVID-19 patients.  Based on that data, Lilly applied for an EUA with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and said it expects about one million doses of the biotech drug to be available by the end of the year.  Several drugmakers are testing antibody treatments for COVID-19 as a means of helping patients\u2019 immune systems fight the virus. None of those drugs have been authorized for emergency use in the United States.  An experimental dual-antibody cocktail developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc was among the medicines given to U.S. President Donald Trump to treat his COVID-19. The company supplied the drug through a compassionate use program.  Lilly chose not to distribute its experimental drug via a compassionate use program, preferring to recruit patients in need for its clinical trials due to the urgency to generate data showing that it works, Chief Executive David Ricks said on a conference call.  In the study involving 268 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, nearly 1% of those who received the Lilly dual-antibody therapy required hospitalization. That compared with 5.8% who got a placebo, suggesting a clinically meaningful response.  The combination therapy also met the trial\u2019s main goal of significantly reducing the amount of virus present 11 days after treatment, compared with a placebo, Lilly said.

Eli Lilly agreed to buy Loxo for $8 billion in January and the deal was wrapped up on Friday.  Bayer has been called on by analysts and investors to strengthen its drug development pipeline as its pharmaceuticals division faces falling sales from 2024 amid looming competition for its two bestselling drugs.  Bayer clinched the initial Vitrakvi deal in November 2017, about a year before the drug eventually won U.S. regulatory approval, marking a bright spot in Bayer\u2019s development pipeline which has suffered a number of setbacks.  Shares in the German company, which also owns seed maker Monsanto, jumped on Friday and were up 4.4 percent at 68.44 euros at 1543 GMT. The stock has been dragged lower by litigation risks as thousands of U.S. plaintiffs claim its Roundup weed-killer played a role in their cancer.  Financial terms such as the initially agreed upfront payments to Loxo as well as milestone payments for development achievements remain unaffected, said a Bayer spokeswoman.  Vitrakvi, which is set to compete with Roche\u2019s entrectinib, has been shown to shrink tumors in 81 percent of cases across 24 tumor types in different parts of the body, all driven by a rare gene anomaly known as NTRK fusion.  Commercial success will depend on the fast uptake of comprehensive gene-sequencing tools for tissue samples at cancer units to help identify the cases that benefit from Vitrakvi.  Bayer has put the drug\u2019s annual peak sales potential at more than 750 million euros ($844 million).  The change-of-control option exercised by Bayer also covers the experimental compound LOXO-195, also known as BAY 2731954, which is designed to treat patients whose cancers are returning after an initial Vitrakvi treatment.  Rather than co-promote with Loxo in the U.S., as initially agreed, Bayer will commercialize the drug there exclusively.  The sharing of U.S. commercial costs and profits in equal parts will be replaced by royalties to be paid by Bayer, the company said, without specifying financial terms.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Opioid abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and drugmakers have been looking for less addictive and safer options for people wanting to reduce pain.  The treatment, tanezumab, belongs to an investigational category of pain medications that target nerve growth factor, a protein involved in the growth of nerve cells, and is also being evaluated to treat chronic lower back and cancer pain.  U.S. regulators in 2015 lifted a hold on trials of medicines targeting the protein due to concerns they could worsen osteoarthritis in a small percentage of patients.  Pfizer\u2019s shares were marginally up at $37.79 in premarket trade. Eli Lilly shares rose 1 percent to $90.50.  The study showed that patients who received two doses of the drug, tanezumab, showed a statistically significant improvement in physical function and an assessment of osteoarthritis by the patients, when compared to placebo, meeting all three goals of the study.  Preliminary safety data showed that the drug was generally well-tolerated in these patients, with only about 1 percent of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse effects.  \u201cSafety concerns have been an overhang on the tanezumab opportunity.

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting about 20 million people in the United States alone.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug bamlanivimab earlier this month after clinical trials showed it reduced the need for hospitalisation or emergency room visits in COVID-19 patients at high risk of disease progression.  The FDA said the drug can be used for people aged 65 and over who have recently been diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and those aged 12 and over who have underlying health conditions putting them at risk of serious illness.  Lilly aims to manufacture up to one million doses by the end of 2020, for use worldwide through early next year. It expects supply to increase substantially from the first quarter of 2021 as additional manufacturing resources come online.  Samsung said it has a long-term manufacturing contract with Lilly. It did not disclose details.  The South Korean firm said it initially struggled to secure raw materials due to tight supplies. It expedited the technology transfer process, allowing it to begin shipments to Lilly five months after agreeing a production deal in May.  The drug is a monoclonal antibody - a widely used class of biotech drugs which in this case is a manufactured copy of an antibody the human body creates to fight infection.  Other potential antibody treatments being developed for COVID-19 patients include one by U.S. drugmaker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which U.S. President Donald Trump received after his diagnosis last month.","103":"March 22 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co:  * TO OFFER DRIVE-THROUGH TESTING FOR SARS-COV-2, VIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19, TO INDIANAPOLIS AREA HEALTHCARE WORKERS FROM MAR 23 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","104":"COPENHAGEN, June 23 (Reuters) - Diabetes drugmaker Novo Nordisk presented a post-hoc analysis of the SUSTAIN 7 trial comparing treatment effect in body weight across baseline BMI subgroups receiving Novo\u2019s Ozempic or Eli Lilly\u2019s dulaglutide, marketed as Trulicity.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Tuesday its antibody cocktail was found effective in preventing COVID-19 in people exposed to those infected with the new coronavirus in an ongoing late stage trial.  The two-antibody cocktail, REGEN-COV, caused a 100% reduction in symptomatic infection and roughly 50% lower overall rates of infection, based on an early analysis of 400 participants in the trial who had a household member with COVID-19.  In comparison, rival Eli Lilly and Co said last week its antibody drug, bamlanivimab, cut the risk of COVID-19 infection by 80% for nursing home residents in a trial.  Regeneron said it would discuss the interim results with U.S. health regulators to potentially expand the antibody cocktail\u2019s current emergency use authorization (EUA). Full data from the trial is expected early in the second quarter.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November granted EUA to the antibody cocktail for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and children.  The current trial tested REGEN-COV for use as a passive vaccine, which involves direct delivery of virus-fighting antibodies into the body unlike traditional vaccines in which the receiver\u2019s immune system is activated to develop its own antibodies.  \u201cThese data using REGEN-COV as a passive vaccine suggest that it may both reduce transmission of the virus as well as reduce viral and disease burden in those who still get infected,\u201d said George Yancopoulos, president and chief scientific officer of Regeneron.  During the trial, jointly run by Regeneron and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, one death and a COVID-19 related hospitalization were reported among those who received placebo, but there was no such incident in the treatment group, the company said.","108":"March 3 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co:  * ELI LILLY AND CO - DOES NOT ANTICIPATE SHORTAGES FOR ANY OF ITS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ALL FORMS OF INSULIN  * ELI LILLY AND CO - DOES NOT SOURCE ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS (API) FOR ANY OF ITD APPROVED MEDICINES FROM CHINA  * ELI LILLY AND CO - CO\u2019S INSULIN MANUFACTURING SITES IN UNITED STATES AND EUROPE HAVE NOT BEEN IMPACTED BY CORONAVIRUS  * ELI LILLY AND CO - ITS MANUFACTURING NETWORK IS FULLY OPERATIONAL AND TAKING STEPS TO PREVENT IMPACT FROM CORONAVIRUS  * ELI LILLY ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOVEL CORONAVIRUS AND RELIABLE SUPPLY OF COMPANY\u2019S MEDICINES Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","109":"May 19 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co:  * RESULTS OF GERAS-US STUDY DEMONSTRATE SOCIETAL COST BURDEN FOR PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS DURING EARLY STAGES OF ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","110":"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said on Thursday it would buy Armo BioSciences Inc for about $1.6 billion to expand its portfolio of drugs that helps body\u2019s immune system fight cancer as the U.S. drugmaker chases rivals in a lucrative market.

Drugmakers argue they have to keep prices high because of the rebates they must pay to pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers to get products on their lists of covered drugs.

A pharmacist refills a container in a drug dispensing machine at the Rock Canyon pharmacy in Provo, Utah, U.S., May 9, 2019. REUTERS\/George Frey  U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington sided with drugmakers Merck & Co Inc, Eli Lilly and Co and Amgen Inc by halting the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rule from taking effect on Tuesday as planned.  Mehta in his ruling set aside the entire rule as invalid, saying HHS lacked authority from the U.S. Congress to compel drug manufacturers to disclose list prices.  \u201cIt is outrageous that an Obama appointed judge sided with big PhRMA to keep high drug prices secret from the American people, leaving patients and families as the real victims,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement, referring to President Donald Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.  PhRMA, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, is the largest industry lobbying group.  HHS Secretary Alex Azar had announced the rule on May 8, saying that forcing drugmakers to disclose their prices in direct-to-consumer TV advertising could help drive down skyrocketing prescription drug costs if the companies were embarrassed by them or afraid they would scare away customers.  HHS in a statement on Tuesday said it was disappointed in the court\u2019s decision, adding that it would work with the Department of Justice on next steps in the litigation.  \u201cPresident Trump and Secretary Azar remain focused on lowering drug prices and empowering patients through more transparency in healthcare costs,\u201d the agency said.  The rule was originally suggested in May 2018 as part of Trump\u2019s \u201cblueprint\u201d to lower prescription drug costs for U.S. consumers.  The judge said such disclosures could well be an effective tool in halting the rising cost of prescription drugs. \u201cBut no matter how vexing the problem of spiraling drug costs may be, HHS cannot do more than what Congress has authorized,\u201d Mehta concluded.  Under the rule, the wholesale, or list, price would be included if it was $35 or more for a month\u2019s supply or the usual course of therapy. HHS said the 10 most commonly advertised drugs had list prices of $488 to $16,938 per month or for a usual course of therapy.  PhRMA said the list prices could be confusing for patients and discourage them from seeking medical care.  Merck, Eli Lilly and Amgen filed their lawsuit alongside the Association Of National Advertisers trade group on June 14, arguing the rule would confuse consumers by forcing them to disclose a price irrelevant to patients with health insurance.  Drugmakers have long argued that list prices do not reflect out-of-pocket costs for most U.S. consumers or take into account the actual prices paid after discounts and rebates negotiated with health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to ensure patient access to the medicines.  The lawsuit alleged that HHS lacked authority to issue the rule and that it violated drugmakers\u2019 free-speech rights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  The U.S. Justice Department defended the rule in court, saying it met a standard the U.S. Supreme Court set in 1985, when it held the government could force advertisers to disclose factual, non-controversial information.","134":"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc\u2019s quarterly profit surged past estimates on Friday, benefiting from a recovery in demand for its flagship eye drug and a jump in sales of its eczema drug, sending the drugmaker\u2019s shares up 3% before the bell.

Regeneron and rival Eli Lilly\u2019s antibody therapies have so far seen lackluster demand as patients need to be isolated for administering the drug through one-time intravenous infusion, which adds to the challenges faced by hospitals that are already teeming with cases of coronavirus infection.  Regeneron\u2019s antibody cocktail garnered $145.5 million in sales for the fourth quarter. While, the consensus Wall Street estimate was $173 million, according to Guggenheim analyst Yatin Suneja.  Last month, the company blamed the underwhelming sales on timing, as it will be delivering additional doses of the therapy to the United States in the first quarter.  The U.S. government last month said it will buy 1.25 million additional doses of the antibody cocktail for about $2.63 billion, with the doses set to be delivered by June-end.  Sales of Regeneron\u2019s physician-administered macular degeneration drug, Eylea, were hurt during the height of the pandemic last year as patients were reluctant to visit doctors\u2019 offices.  As lockdowns eased, U.S. sales of the drug rose nearly 10% to $1.34 billion for the fourth quarter.  Sales from eczema drug Dupixent, which are recorded by Regeneron partner Sanofi, jumped 56% to $1.17 billion.  Excluding items, Regeneron earned $9.53 per share, beating estimates of $8.39 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.","135":"Nov 12 (Reuters) - U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Thursday that efforts are underway in the U.S. to push for the development of antivirals and other therapies for early intervention during the course of the COVID-19 respiratory illness.

The price represents a 68 percent premium to Loxo\u2019s Friday share price close, which some Wall Street analysts said was high for a company with only one drug on the market that it shares with a partner.  Loxo shares surged 66 percent to $232.65, close to the offer price of $235 per share, and prompted stock price rises for a other small developers of targeted cancer therapies, including Array BioPharma, Blueprint Medicines Corp and Clovis Oncology Inc. Lilly shares rose 0.5 percent to $115.28.  The cash deal comes on the heels of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co\u2019s agreement last week to buy Celgene Corp for $74 billion in the largest pharmaceutical deal ever, spurring investors\u2019 hopes of a new wave of large healthcare acquisitions.  Loxo gained prominence in 2017 - just three years after going public - with impressive clinical trial results showing its drug to be highly effective on cancers driven by a single gene mutation known as TRK fusion, regardless of where in the body the tumors originated.  These patients, with more than 17 different types of advanced cancer but all with the same genetic mutation, had run out of other treatment options. Yet some 80 percent who received Loxo\u2019s first drug, a pill called larotrectinib, experienced dramatic, often long-term improvement.  The Connecticut-based company won U.S. approval in November for the treatment under the brand name Vitrakvi, which is sold in partnership with Bayer AG. Lilly said it \u201cvery much\u201d wants to continue the agreement with Bayer, which sells Vitrakvi outside the United States and shares U.S. commercial costs and profits with Loxo.  Loxo is also developing LOXO-292 targeting a different rare gene mutation, and analysts have forecast eventual annual sales of over $1 billion. Lilly would gain full control of that drug as it is not part of Loxo\u2019s Bayer collaboration.  FILE PHOTO: An orchid stands on a table at the entrance to Loxo Oncology headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, U.S., February 20, 2018. Picture taken February 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Bill Berkrot  In an interview, Lilly Chief Executive David Ricks said that drug targeting a mutation known as RET, seen in thyroid, lung and other cancers, was a major driver of the deal. It received breakthrough therapy designation from U.S. regulators, which could speed its path to approval.  Loxo was quick to take advantage of new technologies that can isolate genetic drivers of tumor growth, and the willingness of regulators to approve treatments across tumor types when a specific defect is present, Ricks said at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on Monday.  \u201cLoxo sort of predicted that and then capitalized on that in a way that created value,\u201d Ricks said, adding that the acquisition will help Lilly identify new targetable mutations. He said Lilly was also interested in expanding in immuno-oncology through its own research and possible deals.  FINDING THE PATIENT  Targeted therapies offer the promise of potentially dramatic results if patients most likely to benefit are correctly identified, and are seen as a potential alternative to chemotherapy and its many adverse side effects.  \u201cThe acquisition of Loxo, along with last week\u2019s acquisition of Celgene, may represent the cream of the crop in biotech being harvested by big pharma,\u201d IFS Securities analyst David Bouchey said. \u201cThe size of the deal may indicate Lilly\u2019s willingness to pay up to out-bid the competition.\u201d  BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said the $8 billion valuation seemed high as Wall Street does not expect Loxo revenue to reach $1 billion until 2023.  Loxo\u2019s drugs present the particular challenge of finding advanced cancer patients with the rare genetic mutations, which will require significantly increased use of advanced sequencing of tumors. The TRK mutation targeted by Vitrakvi only occurs in about 1 percent of patients with solid tumor cancers.  That effort got a boost last year, when the U.S. government said its Medicare program will cover so-called next generation sequencing, which looks for hundreds of mutations across all solid tumors, for advanced cancer patients.  Lilly has typically eschewed large deals, preferring to develop its own drugs. But last year it paid $1.6 billion for Armo Biosciences, a developer of immunotherapy cancer drugs, and said in November it was open to more deals.  Lilly\u2019s oncology portfolio includes lung cancer chemotherapy Alimta, which had third-quarter sales of $520.5 million.  Vitrakvi, priced at $32,800 per month, and experimental follow-up drug LOXO-195, on which Bayer is also a partner, together could generate annual sales of about $750 million, according to Piper Jaffray & Co.  Bayer said it does not expect the Lilly deal to impact its contract with Loxo for the time being.  Loxo\u2019s shares have run up nearly 65 percent over the past 12 months, and ten-fold since its IPO in 2014, while Lilly\u2019s stock has surged about 35 percent since last January.","143":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government expects to be able to provide at no cost more than 1 million doses of antibody treatments for COVID-19 similar to the one President Donald Trump received to treat his illness, according to a top U.S. health official on Friday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The government's Operation Warp Speed program currently has \"a couple of hundred thousand doses\" of the monoclonal antibody treatments being developed by drugmakers Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc REGN.O and Eli Lilly & Co LLY.N, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official Paul Mango said on a call with reporters. That would top 1 million doses by the end of the year, he said.  Trump received Regeneron\u2019s treatment last week. In a radio interview with Rush Limbaugh on Friday, Trump said he is working to get both drugs approved quickly and that he may not have recovered without the treatments he received.  Both companies have said the drugs were shown to work in clinical trials and that they have submitted an emergency use authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The drugs are not identical: Regeneron\u2019s treatment is a cocktail of two antibodies meant to protect against the virus, while Lilly\u2019s is a single antibody. Because they have not been tested against the other, it is difficult to know if one is more effective than the other.  It is unclear how long the FDA process to authorize emergency use of the drugs will take. Unless the companies receive that authorization, doctors cannot administer the drugs to patients outside of clinical trials or without a compassionate use authorization like the one President Trump received.  If the drugs are authorized for use by the FDA, Mango said that the government will allocate the treatments to the states based on need, similar to the mechanism used with Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O antiviral drug remdesivir for COVID-19.  Regeneron signed a $450 million deal in July to sell Operation Warp Speed enough doses of its antibody treatment, REGN-COV2, to treat around 300,000 people.  The company said it has not signed any additional deals with Operation Warp Speed, and has around 50,000 doses of its treatment ready now.  Lilly said on Friday it has not signed an agreement with Operation Warp Speed. It said earlier this week that it expects to produce around one million doses of the treatment this year.","144":"Jan 26 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said on Tuesday treatment with a combination of two of its antibodies helped reduce risk of hospitalizations and death due to COVID-19 by 70%, according to results from a late-stage trial.

The treatment, also known as abemaciclib, is approved to treat certain forms of breast cancer but not prevent cancer from recurring, and analysts estimate the data could add billions to its sales.  About 30% of patients with a common subtype of early breast cancer that the drug targets are at a high-risk of their cancer returning, despite progress in the treatment.  \u201cAssuming 40%-50% penetration into this high risk population translates to an about $2 billion incremental market opportunity,\u201d J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a note to clients. But Schott cautioned that more data from the study and competitor results would be needed to fully assess the opportunity.  In May, an independent data monitoring committee said rival Pfizer Inc\u2019s drug, Ibrance, was unlikely to meet the main goal of a study testing it in early breast cancer patients.  The late-stage trial data on Verzenio delivering a reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence or death comes earlier than expected and sets up the drug to have an expanded approval by roughly the middle of next year, said Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan.  Verzenio brought in worldwide sales of about $579.7 million in 2019.  Eli Lilly said it would submit the data from the trial to regulatory authorities before the end of 2020.

The treatments are aimed at patients with mild to moderate disease who are at risk of their condition worsening, AIFA said.  The regulator\u2019s scientific committee said it was appropriate to provide this treatment option, while also pointing out that the data is not yet well developed and there is uncertainty about how much benefit the drugs offer.  \u201cThis is a high-risk setting for which no standard treatment with proven efficacy is currently available,\u201d AIFA said, noting it was giving approval on extraordinary basis due to the emergency situation.  The EU regulator said on Thursday it was reviewing data on the Eli Lilly and Regeneron antibody therapies.  Regeneron\u2019s cocktail of casirivimab and imdevimab was authorised for emergency use in the United States in November, and was given to former U.S. President Donald Trump when he was ill with COVID-19.  Eli Lilly\u2019s combination therapy of two antibodies, bamlanivimab and etesevimab, helped cut the risk of hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients by 70%, data from a late-stage trial showed in January.","156":"(Reuters) - An arthritis drug developed by Eli Lilly & Co and Incyte Corp should not be approved at a 4-milligram dose, advisers to the U.S. FDA voted on Monday, in a setback to the drugmakers that were counting on the treatment as a future blockbuster.  The advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), however, voted in favor of approving a lower, 2 milligram (mg) dose of the drug, baricitinib, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.  An approval of just the lower dose would severely limit the business opportunity for Lilly and Incyte , analysts have said.  Baricitinib, which is already approved in over 40 countries including in the European Union and Japan, is used largely as a 4 mg dose that is crucial for patients who do not respond to available therapies, Christi Shaw, the president of Lilly Bio-Medicines, said in an interview.  The vote comes a year after baricitinib was rejected by the FDA, which cited serious safety concerns.  The agency has continued to raise those concerns, particularly the risk of developing deadly blood clots.  The setback to Lilly and Incyte also comes as major drugs are already vying for a bigger slice of the lucrative market for rheumatoid arthritis drugs.  Pfizer\u2019s Xeljanz, AbbVie\u2019s Humira and Amgen\u2019s Enbrel are all approved to treat the disease.  While the advisory committee agreed that both the 2 mg and 4 mg doses of baricitinib were effective, panelists were divided on the question of the drug\u2019s safety.  The committee\u2019s recommendations, although not binding, are typically followed by the FDA.  A patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis since the age of two described her struggles with the painful disease, telling the committee she had to resort to \u201ceight aspirin a day for 10 years\u201d back in the 1970s when treatment options were limited.  \u201cThere is nothing left for someone like me,\u201d the patient said, urging the committee to vote in favor of both doses.  The panel voted 10-to-5 in favor of approving the 2 mg dose, noting that the drug\u2019s benefits outweighed its risks.  The panel also voted by a similar margin against approving the 4 mg dose.  Lilly expects a decision from the FDA by the end of June, when it will announce further plans, Shaw said.  Incyte shares fell 3.6 percent to $65.71 in after-hours trading on Monday, while Lilly\u2019s stock dipped 1.2 percent to $80.20.","157":"(Reuters) - Drugstore operator chain CVS Health Corp said it had hired former Eli Lilly Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice as the president of its pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business.

Washington, D.C., U.S., September 23, 2020. Graeme Jennings\/Pool via REUTERS\/File Photo  (Reuters) - U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Thursday vaccine developers should push to make billions of their COVID-19 vaccines to ensure access to all parts of the world, instead of focusing on the rich countries.  Fauci\u2019s comments come days after Pfizer Inc said its COVID-19 vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective based on initial results from a large-scale trial, securing a lead in the race to develop a safe and effective vaccine for the respiratory illness.  Pfizer has a $1.95 billion contract with the U.S. government to deliver 100 million vaccine doses beginning this year, as well as a deal with the European Union to supply up to 300 million doses.  \u201cNow a number of different companies are talking about the ability to make billions of doses. That\u2019s what we need. We don\u2019t need hundreds of millions for the rich countries,\u201d Fauci said at a webinar conducted by British think tank Chatham House.  \u201cWe need billions (of vaccine doses), so whether you live in the darkest part of the developing world, or if you live in London, you should have the same access.\u201d  Experts have also raised doubts about access to the vaccine, especially in the developing countries, as it needs to be stored at temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below, posing infrastructure challenges.  \u201cCertainly it is not going to be pandemic for a lot longer, because I believe the vaccines are going to turn that around,\u201d Fauci said, while adding that there may be a need to re-vaccinate people intermittently, if COVID-19 becomes endemic.  Fauci said efforts were underway in the United States to push for the development of antivirals and other therapies for early intervention during the course of the COVID-19 respiratory illness.","160":"April 24 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co reported a quarterly profit on Tuesday on higher demand for its newer treatments such as its diabetes drug Trulicity and psoriasis medicine Taltz.
