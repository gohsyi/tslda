(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil XOM.N on Monday said it will make \"significant\" cuts to spending in the face of the unprecedented slide in oil prices due to the global coronavirus outbreak, which sent its shares to a 17-year low.  FILE PHOTO: A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Sergio Moraes  It was a stunning reversal for the largest U.S. oil producer, which two weeks ago pledged to \u201clean in\u201d to the market drop and maintain outlays in a belief oil demand would rise in the long run.  Other major oil companies have slashed costs amid falling demand and newly unbridled output by top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia. U.S. shale firms have outlined plans to cut expenses by 25% to 30% to cope with this year\u2019s massive drop in oil prices and demand.  U.S. crude futures on Monday settled under $29 a barrel, down from $61 at the start of the year. The decline has cut new drilling and led producers to seek price cuts from suppliers. Weaker demand and rising supply could lead to a 6 million barrel per day surplus by April, further pressuring prices.  Exxon shares fell on Monday to $34.49, a level last touched in 2003, and sent its dividend yield to a record 10.1%. The stock gained $1 in late trading on the expense cuts.  \u201cWe are evaluating all appropriate steps to significantly reduce capital and operating expenses in the near term,\u201d Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a statement. \u201cWe remain focused on being a safe, low-cost operator and creating long-term value for shareholders.\u201d  His statement did not address whether cuts would affect Exxon\u2019s shareholder dividend, which consumed $14.65 billion last year. A spokesman declined to comment on any change to the payout.  The company earlier budgeted between $30 billion and $33 billion for projects this year, sharply up from the $23 billion it spent in 2017, Woods\u2019 first year as CEO.  Exxon could cut 10% to 12% from its outlays and reduce this year\u2019s capital spending to between $28 billion and $29 billion, said Matt Murphy, an analyst at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.  \u201cProtecting the balance sheet and dividend is the priority for this company,\u201d said Murphy, who assigned a low probability to a dividend cut.  Exxon could quickly lower spending in U.S. shale, where it plunked down $6 billion in 2017 for drilling leases in the Permian Basin and where it has run 58 drilling rigs, analysts said. It aimed to pump 1 million barrels a day from the field by 2024.  The company also is spending billions of dollars on oil exploration and production off the coast of Guyana, on liquefied natural gas production, and to boost chemicals output along the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Exxon has asked non-essential employees at several locations to work from home to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus among its offices and refineries.  The world's largest publicly traded oil company, Saudi Aramco, last week outlined plans to cut spending by $2.8 billion to $7.8 billion. BP BP.L and Chevron CVX.N also promised unspecified expense cuts.","1":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N posted its third straight quarterly loss on Friday and detailed deeper spending cuts to come, as the oil major reels from the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on energy demand and prices.  FILE PHOTO: An Exxon sign is seen at a gas station in the Chicago suburb of Norridge, Illinois, U.S., October 27, 2016. REUTERS\/Jim Young\/File Photo  The largest U.S. oil producer by volume said it will slash its capital spending for 2021 to between $16 billion and $19 billion, a cut of as much as 30% from this year\u2019s plan.  The move signals the company will continue to fight to protect its rich shareholder dividend payout, now yielding 11%, by delaying projects. Its 2021 spending plans are lower than rival Royal Dutch Shell Plc's RDSa.L.  It also said it was reassessing its natural gas holdings in North America and could sell or take impairments on assets with a book value of as much as $25 billion to $30 billion - but only if it changes its long-term development plans. It is evaluating those assets this quarter, which include properties it added with its 2010 purchase of XTO Energy, a deal worth roughly $30 billion at the time.  Exxon beat expectations with an adjusted loss of 18 cents per share. Analysts had expected a loss of 25 cents per share, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.  Oil companies last quarter continued to suffer from weak prices for their products, but rivals Chevron Corp CVX.N, Shell and BP Plc BP.L also posted higher-than-expected results after deep cost cuts this year.  \u201cWe remain confident in our long-term strategy and the fundamentals of our business,\u201d said Chief Executive Darren Woods, adding that Exxon would continue to protect its shareholder dividend.  Exxon is looking to sell more assets and plans to hold debt at second quarter levels of around $69.5 billion, said Chief Financial Officer Andrew Swiger on a call with analysts.  It has spent about $16.5 billion this year on new projects and had planned around $23 billion for the full year.  The potential write down of shale gas \u201chas been looming large for some time\u201d and would \u201cdraw a line in the sand on the poor timing around its XTO acquisition a decade ago,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria.  Exxon\u2019s third-quarter net loss was $680 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with a profit of $3.17 billion, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier.  Shares closed 1% lower on Friday at $32.62.  Its output fell 5.8% to 3.67 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries curtailed output and the company pulled back production in other areas due to low prices.  Exploration and production, Exxon\u2019s largest business, lost $383 million, compared with a profit of $2.2 billion last year.  Results were boosted by its chemicals business, which earned $661 million, up from $241 million last year on packaging demand and recovering auto and construction markets. Exxon\u2019s chemicals business regularly generated $1 billion in quarterly profit as recently as 2018.  Its refining business reported a loss of $231 million, compared with profits of $1.2 billion last year, on lower margins and weaker conditions for refiners as the pandemic eats into travel.  \u201cExxon isn\u2019t getting the same benefit from strong marketing as seen by some peers\u201d and the its exploration business \u201ccontinues to be weak,\u201d said Anish Kapadia, director at London-based Palissy Advisors.  Even with reduced spending plans, the company is likely to see negative free cash flow through 2021, said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones.  \u201cThis calls into question how long the company can continue to use debt to fund its dividend,\u201d she said, adding that it is at risk of being cut late next year.  This week, Exxon said it would cut its workforce by about 15% and kept its fourth-quarter dividend flat at 87 cents a share.","2":"Aug 19 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday said production at its Hibernia oil platform in Canada was shut down after a temporary loss of power on Saturday.

Payara\u2019s startup had been slated for \u201cas early as 2023\u201d and was expected to eventually produce some 220,000 barrels per day of crude, according to Exxon\u2019s website.  The firm and its partners Hess Corp and China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd have discovered more than 8 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the South American country, which has no history of production.  The Exxon-led consortium in January produced some 56,320 bpd of crude at the first 1 of its Liza project. Phase 2 of the same venture, at the prolific Stabroek block, is the next project expected to bring production online.  The company said on Tuesday that current operations at Liza were unaffected by a 30% cut in planned capital spending this year as the coronavirus pandemic saps energy demand and oil prices. Startup of the second phase of Liza also remains on track for 2022.  But at neighboring Payara, where Exxon and partners are still awaiting approval from the government to send a third vessel needed to start offshore production, some activities planned for this year are being deferred, Exxon said, potentially delaying its startup by 6-12 months.  Guyana is an integral part of Exxon\u2019s growth plans, Chief Executive Darren Woods said.  Guyana\u2019s Director of Energy Mark Bynoe told Reuters in a January interview that the government was still reviewing Exxon\u2019s plan to develop Payara, and that he could not provide a timeline on when approval could be granted.  Worldwide oil demand has dropped by as much as 30% in recent weeks, coinciding with an oversupply of Middle Eastern crude, sending prices to multi-decade lows.  That has put projects to develop up to 16 billion barrels of oil in Latin America at risk of cancellation or delay, consultancy IHS Markit said this week in a report. That includes some of Guyana\u2019s offshore projects, as their breakeven prices are estimated between $20 and $30 per barrel.","4":"MAPUTO (Reuters) - Mozambican troops battled Islamist insurgents in a town in a northern town on Monday close to billion-dollar gas projects being developed by Exxon Mobil and Total, police said.  The General Commander of Mozambique\u2019s police, Bernardino Rafael, said the insurgents attacked Mocimboa da Praia and its army barracks before dawn on Monday, wounding dozens of people.  Mocimboa da Praia is about 350 km (220 miles) by road from the city of Pemba in Mozambique\u2019s northernmost province of Cabo Delgado and is just south of the Afungi peninsula, where gas projects worth $60 billion are located.  The town is strategically important to the projects. Until recently it was the main airport for workers travelling to the site, before a landing strip was built at Afungi itself, and its port is also used for some cargo deliveries for the projects.  \u201cMocimboa da Praia is currently an active combat zone,\u201d Rafael told reporters at the police headquarters in Maputo.  The army was doing all it could to restore security, he said warning people to stay away.  Security analysts said parts of the town, including the army barracks, were reportedly occupied by the attackers.  The insurgents started staging attacks in Cabo Delgado in 2017, threatening security in a nation set to become a global gas exporter following one of the biggest gas finds in a decade offshore Cabo Delgado.  Little is known about the insurgents, though initial attacks were claimed by a group known as Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama. More recently, Islamic State has claimed a number of attacks.  More than 900 people have been reported killed in the province since 2017, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project, an NGO.  The frequency of attacks has been increasing, leaving some analysts concerned that the insurgency could be a growing threat and that it could cause disrupt the gas boom.  Alexandre Raymakers, Senior Africa Analyst at global risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said the attack highlighted serious gaps in security and raised questions about Mozambique\u2019s ability to defend the developments.  While Raymakers said the LNG infrastructure and personnel will remain \u201caspirational targets\u201d for now, the insurgents will likely be emboldened by their successes and seek to increase the tempo of their operations.  Total said it was aware of the developing situation in Mocimboa do Praia, but the Afungi site remained secure and all of members of its team accounted for.  Both Exxon and Total said the safety of their employees was a priority and they were monitoring developments and working with the relevant authorities on security.  Reuters reported in January that the oil companies had requested more government troops be bought in to protect the site amid a rise in the number of attacks.","5":"LONDON, June 28 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil are looking to re-enter the market in Somalia ahead of an oil block bid round taking place later this year, the country\u2019s oil ministry said in a statement.  Shell and Exxon Mobil had a joint venture there prior to the toppling of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in the early 1990s.  Somalia has been mired in insecurity since Barre left and is battling Islamist group al Shabaab that frequently carries out bombings in the capital Mogadishu and elsewhere in the country.  The country currently does not produce any oil but production could transform the economy as early stage seismic data has shown there could be significant oil reserves offshore.  \u201c(An) agreement was signed in Amsterdam on June 21st 2019 and settles issues relating to surface rentals and other incurred obligations on offshore blocks,\u201d the ministry said.  The parties have also agreed a plan to convert their old contracts in line with the a new petroleum bill that was passed earlier this year.  Somalia hopes to allocate 15 offshore blocks with a potential bid date schedule for November. A roadshow is being organised in Houston, Texas in late September or early October.  Somalia has also passed a revenue sharing agreement, splitting revenue with oil producing states but has not yet decided on the share the government will keep in the blocks it awards.

REUTERS\/Toru Hanai  The decision to pare its LNG project portfolio follows the go-ahead of a giant Royal Dutch Shell-led project in British Columbia, and Exxon\u2019s focus on LNG projects in Asia, the Middle East and the United States.  Global LNG demand is expected to double to 550 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2030, as countries like China move away from coal to cleaner fuels. The top import market for LNG is northeast Asia.  Exxon\u2019s West Coast Canada (WCC) LNG export project, located in northern British Columbia, was expected to produce around 15 million tonnes per year of LNG to serve Asian buyers, with plans for further expansion up to 30 million tonnes per year.  The project was being jointly reviewed by the province and Canadian environmental regulators, an assessment that had been underway since 2015, though no major documents have been filed since 2016.  Exxon formally withdrew from the process in a Dec. 5 letter to the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Office, posted on the regulator\u2019s website.  \u201cAfter careful review, ExxonMobil and Imperial (Oil Resources Ltd) have withdrawn the WCC LNG project from the environmental assessment process,\u201d a spokeswoman for ExxonMobil confirmed in an email.  Exxon\u2019s decision signaled it is concentrating on LNG projects with Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] and a proposed expansion of its chilled-gas operation in Papua New Guinea, said Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at Poten & Partners, LNG tanker brokers and consultants.  \u201cThey have got a pretty robust pipeline of liquefaction projects globally.

Exxon has been \u201ctaking advantage of opportunities as they become available to invest, restructure or divest assets to strengthen our long-term competitive position and provide the highest return to shareholders,\u201d said spokeswoman Julie King.  LNG demand is growing but environmental groups say exports will boost carbon emissions in Canada, both through gas extraction and the liquefaction process.  The WCC LNG export project planned to have liquefaction and storage facilities for natural gas, loading facilities and a third-party pipeline.

The justices will weigh whether the lawsuit must be heard in state court as the city would prefer or in federal court, which corporate defendants generally view as a more favorable venue. The suit targets 21 U.S. and foreign energy companies that extract, produce, distribute or sell fossil fuels.  The outcome could affect around a dozen similar lawsuits by U.S. states, cities and counties including Rhode Island and New York City seeking to hold such companies liable for the impact of climate change.  Baltimore and the other jurisdictions are seeking damages under state law for the harms they said they have sustained due to climate change, which they attribute in part to the companies\u2019 role in producing fossil fuels that produce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.  The plaintiffs have said they have had to spend more on infrastructure such as flood control measures to combat sea-level rise caused by a warming climate. Climate change has been melting land-based ice sheets and glaciers.  The Supreme Court in 2019 declined the companies\u2019 emergency request to put the Baltimore litigation on hold after a federal judge ruled that the case should be heard in state court. In March, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge\u2019s decision.  In the absence of federal legislation in the bitterly divided U.S. Congress targeting climate change, the lawsuits are the latest effort to force action via litigation.  The Supreme Court in a landmark 2007 ruling said that carbon dioxide is a pollutant that could be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Under Democratic President Barack Obama, the agency issued the first-ever regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gases. But efforts in Congress to enact sweeping climate change legislation have failed.  The court took action in the case three days before it begins its new nine-month term short one justice after the Sept. 18 death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Donald Trump has nominated federal appeals court judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace Ginsburg.","9":"JOHANNESBURG\/MILAN (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is likely to delay the greenlighting of its $30 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique as the coronavirus disrupts early works and a depressed gas market makes investors wary, six sources told Reuters.  FILE PHOTO: Logos of ExxonMobil are seen in its booth at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan April 4, 2017. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai\/File Photo  Top U.S. oil and gas company Exxon said on Tuesday it was evaluating \u201csignificant\u201d cuts to capital spending and operating expenses. Energy firms worldwide have slashed spending this month as oil prices plummeted to 18-year lows after global travel curbs and reduced economic activity destroyed demand.  The coronavirus pandemic is forcing delays to projects worldwide. Qatar, the world\u2019s largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), is delaying a big expansion in which Exxon is a major partner.  The Rovuma LNG project, which will produce from a deepwater block off Mozambique containing more than 85 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, was expected to get the go-ahead in the first half of 2020.  But three sources familiar with the project told Reuters that Exxon\u2019s partners want to push back a final investment decision (FID).  A further three sources said the pandemic is disrupting work on the project to such a degree that FID before the second half is unlikely.  Any delay would leave Exxon\u2019s project further behind rival Total, which took FID last June on its neighboring project.  Exxon might be left with no choice.  \u201cCOVID-19 is affecting guys going into Mozambique, it\u2019s affecting Chinese and Korean financiers, and clearly you\u2019ve had the arse drop out of the oil market,\u201d said a source with knowledge of the project.  The pandemic is causing delays to the financing needed for the project, the source added.  Rovuma LNG is managed by Mozambique Rovuma Venture, a joint venture owned 35.7% each by Exxon and Eni with the remaining stake of 28.6% held by China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).  LNG prices hit a record low of $2.7 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) last month, and Rovuma requires an average price of $7 per mmBtu throughout its life to be profitable, according to Bernstein analysts.  Another source with knowledge of internal discussions said with the energy outlook uncertain and LNG supplies set to rise sharply by 2025, some of the project partners want to \u201ccool Exxon\u2019s heels\u201d and delay.  Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler declined to discuss whether partners are seeking to push back the FID. \u201cThis is a complex project that will be developed over several years,\u201d he said.  China\u2019s CNPC did not respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment and Eni declined to comment.  Mozambique\u2019s state oil firm ENH, Galp Energia and KOGAS, which each have 10% stakes in the project, either did not provide a comment or referred Reuters to Exxon.  EARLY WORKS HIT  Exxon has already committed to $500 million in initial investment, and FID is the next stage in funding based on which banks can extend lines of credit.  But early works are being disrupted by coronavirus travel restrictions. International workers travel regularly to the project site on the Afungi peninsula in Cabo Delgado province, where they live cheek-by-jowl and share a canteen for six- or eight-week stints.  Many hail from countries that have been hit hard by the coronavirus and have put in place travel restrictions. Mozambique has imposed a 14-day quarantine for those entering the country.  That has left key personnel unable to reach the site.  \u201cIt seems as though they are electing to postpone some of the early stage works and contracts for now,\u201d another source familiar with the matter said. \u201cI doubt we can expect their FID before the end of 2020.\u201d  Exxon\u2019s Spitler said employees\u2019 health and safety was a priority and declined to comment on the day-to-day details of its operations.","10":"BOSTON (Reuters) - More than 135 investors managing more than $2 trillion are forming a coalition to push Exxon Mobil Corp into making sweeping changes including refreshing its board and focusing more on energy transition, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

The Exxon target grabbed the spotlight on the day Chevron was meeting with investors and analysts to make its own Permian case.  Woods told investors that Exxon could earn a double-digit returns in the Permian, even at $35-per-barrel oil.  Exxon shares were down 4% at $48.29 in midday trading.  Several people involved in valuing the Exxon Permian asset during an internal assessment in 2019 said employees were being forced to use unrealistic assumptions about how quickly the company could drill wells there to arrive at a higher value, the report said.

But a few employees involved in Exxon\u2019s annual development planning estimated the value was closer to $40 billion in 2019.  When employees delivered the new number, they were asked to \u201cclaw back\u201d some of the lost value by using different assumptions, including a more optimistic \u201clearning curve\u201d that estimated the rate at which they would improve drilling times, the WSJ report said, citing the whistleblower complaint.  Some employees objected to using the new learning curve, which they viewed as unrealistic, it said. The value was ultimately adjusted to about $50 billion, the report added.  At least one employee who complained was fired last year, the WSJ said, citing a person familiar with the matter.  The largest U.S. oil producer posted losses in the first three quarters of 2020 on an ill-timed spending increase that collided with a downturn in fuel demand and prices. To cope, the company has cut employees and project spending.  Exxon slashed 2020 spending in the Permian to about $3 billion from an original $7.4 billion budget, and said it would cut the number of drilling rigs working there from 55 to 15 or fewer.

Socialist President Nicolas Maduro has accused the United States of plotting to invade Venezuela and overthrow his government, while Washington has placed sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s debt and members of Maduro\u2019s government over accusations of corruption, human rights violations and election-rigging.  A century-long territorial dispute between Venezuela and Guyana has flared up in recent years with Exxon\u2019s discovery of more than 5 billion barrels of oil and gas off Guyana\u2019s coast. In OPEC-member Venezuela, crude output is hovering near 70-year lows amid a severe economic crisis.  Guyana says Caracas gave up its claim to the Essequibo, a sparsely populated jungle area making up two-thirds of Guyana\u2019s territory, after an 1899 ruling by an international tribunal, but Venezuela later backtracked on that decision. The U.N. this year referred the dispute to the International Court of Justice.  Two vessels owned by Norway's Petroleum Geo-Services PGS.OL and under contract by Exxon Mobil were conducting seismic survey work in the area. The ships stopped their work and turned east after the Venezuelan navy told them Guyana did not have jurisdiction there.

Treasurer Sam Basil said the country also needs better forecasts from Exxon and Total on the expected income flow from a $13 billion plan to double the country\u2019s liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Basil was appointed earlier this month by Prime Minister James Marape, who led a revolt against former prime minister Peter O\u2019Neill in May.  France\u2019s Total is leading the Papua LNG project, which will develop the Elk-Antelope gas fields to feed two new LNG production units to be sited at the PNG LNG plant, run by Exxon.  At the same time, Exxon and its partners plan to add a third new unit at PNG LNG, which will partly be fed by another new field, P\u2019nyang.  Total recently reached an agreement with the government setting terms for its Papua LNG project, while Exxon is in the process of negotiating a separate agreement with the government for P\u2019nyang.  Treasurer Basil said the projects should all be treated as one, rather than \u201cunder the cloak of separate joint ventures\u201d.  \u201cI am putting each of the project partners in all of these projects on notice that the concerns of our people must be addressed through dialogue and negotiations with the state and that we expect all parties to contribute to a fair and equitable outcome,\u201d he said.  Exxon\u2019s original $19 billion PNG LNG project is the biggest foreign investment in the country and crucial to the economy, but the plant has been a disappointing contributor since it started exporting LNG in 2014.  Last year\u2019s earthquake which forced a shutdown of PNG LNG dented the government\u2019s take from the project more than Exxon had expected it would. The 2019 budget had assumed that oil and gas sector revenue would fall by 9.4 pct from 2018, but it actually fell by 16.4 percent, Basil said.  He plans to ask the Treasury and Exxon to come up with new detailed forecasts of future cash flows from the project to the national and provincial governments and local landowners.  He also said the government would put on hold talks with the owners of the Wafi Golpu gold project, Newcrest and South Africa\u2019s Harmony Gold, until the state negotiating team has talked to the Morobe provincial government about its aspirations for the project.  \u201cOur future prosperity depends on delivering these projects and delivering them well.

The facility could open by 2022, it said.  Australia\u2019s energy market operator warned in March that Victoria, the country\u2019s biggest gas consuming state, could face shortages from mid-2021 due to a rapid drop in supply from the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture, owned by ExxonMobil and BHP Billiton.  Output from the Gippsland Basin, the state\u2019s mainstay supplier over the past 50 years, is expected to fall to just half of 2018 levels by 2022, it said.  Even though Australia is set to challenge Qatar as the world\u2019s top LNG exporter, local gas supplies are under threat due to field declines and long-term export contracts.

Under questioning from Kim Berger, a lawyer for the state, Tillerson testified that the proxy cost represented a \u201cmacro level\u201d assessment of the likely effect of future carbon regulations around the world on total demand for fossil fuels, and was incorporated into a data guide used throughout Exxon.  Separately, he said, the company would sometimes evaluate greenhouse gas costs at a \u201cmicro level\u201d for specific projects, when appropriate.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re really trying to do is be the most realistic, present our best view of how this is going to turn out,\u201d he said.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  Tillerson went on to offer a more full-throated defense of the company when he was questioned by its lawyer, Theodore Wells, saying all the allegations in the case were false.  He said Exxon would never have any incentive to lowball greenhouse gas costs internally.  \u201cWe\u2019d be misinforming ourselves,\u201d he said.  Tillerson served as Exxon CEO from 2006 to 2017, and U.S. secretary of state under President Donald Trump from 2017 to 2018.  Last Thursday, just two days after the New York trial began, Massachusetts filed a similar lawsuit accusing Exxon of misleading investors and consumers for decades about the role fossil fuels play in climate change.  Both Massachusetts and New York began investigating Exxon after news reports in 2015 saying company scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.  Exxon and other oil companies including BP Plc, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc face lawsuits by cities and counties across the United States seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels brought on by climate change.  The companies have said in court filings that they cannot be held liable for climate change.","46":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp does not have a timeline for restarting fuel-producing units at its second-largest U.S. refinery following a fire Wednesday that cut production, sources said, as the shutdown boosted gasoline prices on Thursday.

REUTERS\/Lee Celano\/File Photo  Some units remain in operation at the refinery including a crude distillation unit (CDU), gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) and a coker, the sources said.  A blaze on Wednesday cut output at Exxon\u2019s 502,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery. It was the third Exxon petrochemical plant along the U.S. Gulf Coast to suffer damage in less than a year. 2  No injuries were reported because of the fire that broke out from a natural gas pipeline shortly before midnight on Tuesday and burned for about seven hours on Wednesday, the sources said.  The blaze affected pipes laid on racks 50 feet in the air, and forced the shutdown of multiple units at the oil refinery and adjoining chemical plant, the sources said.  The fire forced the shutdown of three CDUs and an FCCU, but was confined to the pipe bundle where it broke out.  Operations at the refinery and chemical plant continue, Exxon spokesman Jeremy Eikenberry said on Thursday. He declined to discuss the status of individual processing units.  Exxon was meeting contractual commitments and expected to meet all customer commitments, he said.  The company and other refiners are suffering from weak margins due to excess supplies and falling demand for some fuels. Exxon U.S. refining profits fell 42% last year over 2018 due to weak margins and higher maintenance costs.  CDUs are the heart of the refining process, providing the primary breakdown of crude oil into hydrocarbon feedstocks that other production units convert into motor fuels and feedstocks for plastics.  Traders on the New York Mercantile Exchange attributed a jump in gasoline futures since on Wednesday and Thursday to the combined impact of an FCCU outage last week at the Phillips 66 Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, and the Baton Rouge fire.  U.S. gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained 0.18%, or 0.28 cents at $1.5838 per gallon on Thursday. On Wednesday, it rose 4.4%, or 6.68 cents.  The blaze was the third major fire to hit Exxon\u2019s U.S. operations since last March when a fire broke out in a Baytown, Texas, refinery unit. In July, a fire in Exxon\u2019s Baytown Olefins plant injured 37 workers.","47":"FILE PHOTO: Logos of ExxonMobil are seen in its booth at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan April 4, 2017.

Washington has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Venezuela this year to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro, whose 2018 re-election has been dismissed by the United States and dozens of other countries as a sham. Some measures have led tanker operators to stop carrying oil for Venezuela\u2019s state-run PDVSA oil firm.  The decision by world\u2019s largest publicly-traded oil producer to ban the Venezuela-linked tankers should affect about 250 vessels, two of the people familiar with the matter estimated.  Exxon declined to comment. PDVSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Over 25 foreign vessels reach Venezuelan ports per month, according to PDVSA and Refinitiv Eikon data. Some are known to turn their transponders off to avoid detection amid the tough U.S. sanctions targeting Venezuela\u2019s oil industry.  Average freight earnings for supertankers on the closely-watched U.S.-China route jumped over $20,000 on Friday to $87,625 a day, the highest level since rates for the route were first published in March, Baltic Exchange data showed.  \u201cThe VLCC pool here (in the Caribbean) has been very thin for some while, and this week rates pushed to levels not seen for many a year - $12 million now to the Far East and it\u2019s almost \u2018name your price,\u2019\u201d E.A.

This year, it blocked six climate resolution from appearing on the proxy ballot at its May 27 shareholder meeting.  U.S. oil majors face less government pressure to curb greenhouse gas emissions and have lagged European rivals in striking deals with activists. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Repsol SA and BP Plc have each moved to slash carbon emissions and meet global accords.  New York state\u2019s pension fund, Church Commissioners for England, and Legal & General Investment Management, which all battled Exxon over global warming and lobbying disclosures have this year taken up a call to split the CEO and chairman roles, expecting a better reception from an outsider.  \u201cThe company has been a laggard on financial performance, climate risk management and lobbying disclosure for quite some time now,\u201d said Thomas DiNapoli, New York state comptroller and head of the state\u2019s biggest pension fund. \u201cIts peers in Europe, many of whom have independent board chairs, are outperforming Exxon on all these,\u201d he said.  California Public Employees Retirement System, which holds 9.6 million Exxon shares, just behind New York\u2019s 10.2 million shares, last week came out in favor of splitting the two roles. Proxy adviser Glass, Lewis & Co separately called for splitting the two roles.  On Tuesday, Institutional Shareholder Services urged holders to vote \u201cagainst\u201d creating an independent chairman, reversing its stance from a year ago. Exxon\u2019s naming of a lead director able to meet with shareholders changed its view, ISS wrote.  Exxon management is under scrutiny after reporting the first loss in three decades. Under CEO Woods, Exxon spent heavily in the last three years for new oil and natural gas supplies, a move that has so far backfired as prices collapsed.  In a sign of how seriously it takes the challenge, Exxon on Wednesday issued a four page rebuttal to Glass Lewis, challenging the advisory firm on the peer group used to measure executive pay, and praising CEO Woods\u2019 \u201cin-depth knowledge of ExxonMobil and its integrated, multinational operations.\u201d  Climate measures elsewhere are gaining. Three climate proposals this year have won majority votes, including at oil firms\u2019 Phillips 66 and Ovintiv Inc. While not all results from the 15 are in yet, last year none received a majority, according to data compiled by the Sustainable Investments Institute.  Activists are smarting from a 2017 vote. That year, 62% of shareholders approved a measure led by New York state and calling for Exxon to disclose business impacts from complying with climate policies. After agreeing not to pursue the topic the following year, New York officials were disappointed by the resulting report.  An Exxon spokesman declined to comment, pointing to rebuttals that note it has increased the lead director\u2019s power. Combining the chairman and CEO roles \u201censures items of greatest importance for the business\u201d are quickly brought to the board, Exxon told shareholders in urging a vote against the measure. It also pointed to $10 billion in lower-emissions investments it has made over a decade.  The proposal for an independent board chairman would not take effect under Woods, but would be phased in for future CEOs.  As at other big companies, shareholder support for an independent chairman has never gotten far at Exxon. Last year, 40.7% of Exxon shareholders supported the measure, up from 38.7% in 2018. A measure calling for the company to report on its lobbying activities also failed.  But both were \u201cwithin striking distance of getting a majority,\u201d said Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at the Church Commissioners for England.

The southern mega-project involves the development of the Nahr Bin Umar and Artawi oilfields and raising production from the two fields to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from around 125,000 bpd now, Abdul Mahdi said.  The project is crucial to supplying water to oilfields in the south in order to boost pressure and keep production steady.  Media reports had quoted Iran\u2019s ambassador in London on Monday saying the United States would grant waivers to Iraq allowing it to deal with Iran economically, in exchange for Baghdad signing an oil deal with Washington.  \u201cTalks now between the oil ministry and Exxon Mobil and PetroChina are focused on how to split profits if oil prices rise or decline,\u201d Abdul Mahdi said in response to a Reuters question on the obstacles holding up a final agreement.  \u201cThe deal lasts for 30 years and such financial details are sensitive and should be given more discussions,\u201d he added.  Iraq is the second largest oil exporter in OPEC and has long-term aims to boost output curtailed by decades of war and sanctions. Such projects are among the most valuable prizes in the world for international oil companies. An initial agreement would be a big boost for Exxon Mobil\u2019s plans to expand in Iraq.

U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out last year from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, and reinstated sanctions against Tehran.

Exxon\u2019s shares have underperformed its major rivals\u2019 in recent years. The disposals would help the company increase spending on new developments and appease investors unhappy with weak cash generation and oil output, which flatlined under Woods\u2019 predecessor Rex Tillerson.  The sales would see Exxon effectively quit its upstream oil and gas business in Europe, according to the three banking sources with direct knowledge of the plans. They would free up cash to invest in new developments in Guyana, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, Brazil and the United States.  An Exxon spokesman declined to comment on specific assets offered for sale but noted it has told Wall Street its asset sales could reach $25 billion through 2025.  Shares in the world\u2019s top listed energy company rose following the Reuters report and were up 1.5% at 1816 GMT.  In recent months, the Texas-based company has drawn up an extensive list of assets that it wants to divest, spanning at least 11 countries, the sources said.  The list, details of which have not been previously reported, would easily exceed its current divestment target which envisages it selling about $15 billion of assets by 2021.  Exxon has struck a number of deals in recent months including a $4.5 billion exit from Norway, and is also already offering assets in Australia, Nigeria, Malaysia.  The expanded plan will see Exxon also sell out of operations in the British North Sea, Germany and Romania, according to the sources. In Europe, that would leave it with production only in the Netherlands, where it holds a stake with Royal Dutch Shell in the giant Groningen gas field which the government plans to shut down in 2022.  The new plan would also see Exxon significantly pare back operations in Southeast Asia with the sale of its assets in Indonesia and Malaysia, the sources said.  In Africa, Exxon wants to sell its operations in Chad, Equatorial Guinea as well as parts of its Nigerian assets.  While Exxon is set to ramp up its spending sharply in the coming years to develop new oil and gas projects, most of its peers have more cautious spending plans due to an uncertain outlook for oil prices and growing pressure from investors to diversify away from fossil fuels toward renewables.

Exxon\u2019s shares heavily underperformed relative to other Oil Majors over the past five years.  tmsnrt.rs\/2LsEuoy  Unlike rivals such as Shell and BP, Exxon did not carry out major review of its portfolio in recent decades. BP sold over $65 billion of assets following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico while Shell sold over $30 billion after acquiring rival BG Group in 2016.  Under Woods, Exxon is set to sharply increase its spending in the coming years as it launches new, large oil and gas developments. In its 2019 investor day, the company said it planned to boost its annual capital spending from $26 billion in 2018 to $30-$35 billion between 2021 and 2025.  Building up its coffers via asset sales could help allay concerns that Exxon will ramp up its debt levels to fund new projects, particularly with oil prices remaining stubbornly close to $60 a barrel.  Moody\u2019s Investor Service on Tuesday changed Exxon\u2019s outlook to negative from stable due to its negative free cash flow and anticipated use of debt to fund its future capital spending.  Moody\u2019s has forecast negative free cash flow of about $7 billion this year and $9 billion next year. It warned the company\u2019s debt rating could be lowered next year if Exxon\u2019s financial metrics weaken further.  By contrast, Exxon\u2019s biggest rival Shell has generated $21 billion in free cash flows so far this year and the figure is expected to rise further in the fourth quarter.  \u201cThe company\u2019s high level of growth capital investments cannot be funded with operating cash flow and asset sales at projected levels given ExxonMobil\u2019s substantial dividend payout, absent meaningfully higher commodity prices and earnings from downstream and chemicals,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.","59":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A number of institutional investors in ExxonMobil Corp XOM.N have said they will file a shareholder resolution which calls on the world's largest oil company to set targets for lowering its greenhouse gas emissions.

U.S. energy companies are losing money on oil production, cutting tens of thousands of workers, and some are struggling to obtain financing. Texas producers have been hurt as oil prices have crashed two-thirds this year. Last month alone, prices fell by half, to near $20 a barrel, as the coronavirus slashed fuel demand.  The state\u2019s Railroad Commission, which has the authority to mandate production curbs in the state, will consider next week a proposal to require larger oil producers to cut output by 20% beginning May 1.  The proposal was submitted by shale producers Parsley Energy Inc and Pioneer Natural Resources Co, and backed by Commissioner Ryan Sitton, who has said the idea should be considered as a way to curb a free fall in crude oil prices, stabilize the industry and prevent smaller firms from being locked out of storage and the sales by the largest oil companies.  The state\u2019s two other commissioners took to Twitter last week to distance themselves from Sitton, saying they had not yet made up their minds. Passage requires two of three to agree on curbs, which would be the first by the state in nearly 50 years.  Over the past few years, Texas regulators championed the state\u2019s soaring oil and gas output as Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut production to bolster global prices. State law allows Texas to take steps to limit local production, but it has not done so since the 1970s.  \u201cProposals to impose quotas or mandatory production cuts will lead to unintended consequences for the state to the benefit of competing states in the U.S. and countries abroad,\u201d Gjervik said.","61":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Sergio Moraes  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday it made its 18th discovery offshore Guyana, as the largest U.S. oil producer continues to develop one of the world\u2019s most important new oil and gas blocks in the last decade.  Exxon said the discovery, made at the Redtail-1 well, will add to its previous estimate of over 8 billion barrels of total oil and gas resources on the Stabroek Block.  However, the company did not specify how much it estimates would be recoverable from this well and did not outline development plans for it.  \u201cExxon has a good problem in that it has a large number of discoveries to choose from, which allows it to optimize and choose the highest return discoveries to develop,\u201d said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at Palissy Advisors.  Kapadia said Exxon could look at selling off some of the discoveries that may not be as important for it as they would be for other smaller companies.  Exxon operates the Stabroek block as part of a consortium with Hess Corp and China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd and began production on it ahead of schedule in December.  The new find continues the Exxon-led consortium\u2019s long string of discoveries in Latin America\u2019s newest crude producing nation and underscores the importance of Guyana to Exxon for increasing its future oil output.  Exxon also said it encountered high-quality oil-bearing reservoirs while drilling at its Yellowtail-2 well and was evaluating them for development.","62":"GEORGETOWN (Reuters) - Guyana joined the ranks of the world\u2019s oil producers for the first time on Friday as U.S. oil company Exxon Mobil said it began producing crude off the coast of the South American country.  President David Granger hailed the development in an address to the nation, predicting the revenues from oil would prove \u201ctransformative\u201d for the underdeveloped economy.  The Exxon-led consortium, which also includes Hess Corp and China\u2019s CNOOC, plans to produce 120,000 barrels-per-day (bdp) from the Liza well in the coming months. The Stabroek block, where the well is located, is expected to produce 750,000 bpd by 2025, Exxon said.  Guyana\u2019s president said the first oil output would usher in a \u201cdecade of development\u201d and that the government would manage oil resources prudently.  \u201cPetroleum production has brought the prospects of a higher quality of life closer to our households and neighbourhoods. It is a momentous event,\u201d Granger said. \u201cEvery Guyanese will benefit from petroleum production. No one will be left behind.\u201d  Exxon said it expected to sell the first cargo from the Liza well in the next several weeks. The Guyanese government is separately conducting an tender process to sell the first three cargoes of the oil it is entitled to under its contract with the consortium.  The consortium has discovered more than 6 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas in the Stabroek block.","63":"MELBOURNE, June 11 (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea has passed legislation seeking to boost benefits to the country from oil, gas and mine developments, which could impact talks on stalled projects planned by Exxon Mobil Corp and Newcrest Mining .  The amended laws reflect a push by Prime Minister James Marape, who came to power a year ago on a platform to lift the country out of poverty by getting a bigger share of wealth from the country\u2019s energy and minerals.  The country would not break legitimate exploration or development contracts or agreements, Marape said in a posting on his Facebook page after the legislation was passed on Wednesday.  \u201cI can assure our investors that we know they must make money for their shareholders too, so we will not be greedy, but we (are) just asking for a fair share, if they want to harvest our resources,\u201d Marape wrote.  The government also plans to put in place a production sharing regime to take effect from 2025, he said.  Marape\u2019s push for more benefits for PNG has held up talks on Exxon\u2019s P\u2019nyang gas development, key to a $13 billion plan to double the country\u2019s liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and talks with Newcrest to develop its Wafi Golpu gold project.  Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic said the amended law could pose challenges for the LNG expansion.  \u201cThe move may signal the PNG government\u2019s resolve to maintain a tough approach to fiscal terms negotiations,\u201d Kavonic said in a note.  Spokesmen for Exxon in PNG and Newcrest were not immediately available to comment.  Exxon\u2019s partner in PNG, Oil Search, said it assumed the legislation was designed to clarify the government\u2019s intentions.  \u201cWe remain confident that the PNG government is fully supportive of LNG expansion and the oil and gas industry as a whole,\u201d an Oil Search spokesman said.  The delays on multibillion dollar investments come as PNG struggles with a huge budget deficit which led it to seek a $364 million emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund, obtained this week.","64":"April 10 (Reuters) -  * EXXON, QATAR IN TALKS ON U.S. SHALE DEAL - WSJ, CITING SOURCES Source text - on.wsj.com\/2GOQcTM Further company coverage:","65":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: An Exxon sign is seen at a gas station in the Chicago suburb of Norridge, Illinois, U.S., October 27, 2016. REUTERS\/Jim Young\/File Photo  Oil shipping costs for United States Gulf Coast to Asia cooled this week from record highs on the prospect of more vessels becoming available. Nearly 300 oil tankers globally were placed off limits due to U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.  Seventeen supertankers returned to service in October after being sidelined for overhauls, as 11 entered drydocks. That was the first overall increase in available ships since May, according to shipbroker McQuilling Services.  Exxon Mobil Corp provisionally chartered the Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) KHK Empress to transport crude from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Singapore for $11.5 million, or $5.75 a barrel, according to four market sources. Exxon declined to comment.  Trafigura AG also tentatively booked the Ascona to ship U.S. crude to South Korea for $12.9 million, or $6.45 a barrel, three market sources said. Trafigura had no immediate comment on the charter.  Both were below rates of between $16 million and $17.5 million, or $8 to $8.50 per barrel, quoted earlier in the week for U.S. to Asia routes, shipbrokers said. Assessed rates peaked on Friday around $11 a barrel.  Arbitration opportunities to ship U.S. crude to Asia also have emerged with Russia\u2019s ESPO Blend crude climbing to record premiums in the last month, dragging other grades sold in Asia higher, traders said.  The price of WTI delivered into Singapore was assessed on Thursday at more than $5 a barrel over dated Brent, covering freight costs and providing some margin, traders said.  \u201cAsia needs oil. It\u2019s the shortest region globally. They will pull (the arbitration window) open,\u201d a U.S. trader said.  In addition to U.S. sanctions on Chinese tankers that crimped supply, some vessels have been drydocked awaiting exhaust scrubbers to meet regulations that take effect on Jan. 1. Those regulations ban ocean-going vessels from using fuel with sulfur content above 0.5% unless they are equipped with the scrubbers.  The return of some tankers into service could signal a further drop in global oil freight rates. Another factor affecting demand was refiners including China\u2019s Sinopec cut runs and a series of failed charters adding to available tonnage, said Oliver Ge, a senior advisor at McQuilling Services.","69":"A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018.

Houthi authorities gave long-awaited approval in November for a visit to assess the tanker. A U.N. team, which includes a private company contracted by the world body to do the work, was aiming to travel to the tanker early next month.  But U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that time line was now uncertain amid U.N. concerns about signals from the Houthis that they are considering a \u201creview\u201d of their formal approval of the tanker mission.  \u201cHouthi officials have advised the U.N. to pause certain preparations pending the outcome of such process, which would create further delays to the mission,\u201d he said in a statement.  He said the United Nations had so far spent $3.35 million on preparing for the mission. The world body also has to lease a technically equipped vessel, but needs a letter from the Houthis with security assurances.  \u201cWe regret that, to date, we have not received a response to our multiple requests for this letter, the lack of which would increase the cost of the mission by hundreds of thousands of dollars,\u201d Dujarric said.  Houthi-run Al Masirah TV last week quoted a senior Houthi official as saying the United Nations had made additional requests that had not been part of an agreed framework.  \u201cTheir new requests are related to their financial relationship with insurance firms and we will not get involved in matters that do not concern us,\u201d the Houthi official said.  Last month, former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. The United Nations is also reviewing whether that could affect the tanker mission.  A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The move marks a U-turn for Exxon Mobil and Chevron. The top two U.S. oil and gas producers had resisted joining the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) after its launch in 2014.  Exxon and Chevron differ from their rivals on several topics around climate, and in the past have refused to join a call by the European firms for a global price on carbon.  Together with its three newest members, the group will account for around 30 percent of global oil and gas production and 20 percent of primary energy consumption, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in a tweet.  \u201cThe addition of 3 U.S. companies gives us more impact to lead the industry\u2019s response to climate change,\u201d he wrote.  The OGCI currently comprises 10 firms including BP, Royal Dutch Shell, France\u2019s Total as well as national oil companies of China, Mexico, Brazil and Saudi Arabia.  The announcement comes ahead of Climate Week in New York next week, a global gathering of world and company leaders around climate change.  \u201cWe are pleased to be joining OGCI to work constructively on addressing the risks of climate change,\u201d Chevron Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said in the statement.  The OGCI created a $1 billion fund to develop technologies to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the sector as the world aims to shift toward a low-carbon economy.  Exxon and Chevron will each contribute $100 million to the fund, the statement said.  Exxon in recent years came under fire from investors and faced lawsuits over its climate policies and disclosures.  It will expand its investment in greenhouse gas emission-reduction research as part of the initiative, the company said in a statement. Earlier this year, Exxon pledged to reduce its methane emissions by 15 percent by 2020 and last year began an equipment upgrade at its XTO Energy shale business unit to cut emissions during production.  \u201cIt will take the collective efforts of many in the energy industry and society to develop scalable, affordable solutions that will be needed to address the risks of climate change,\u201d Exxon CEO Darren Woods said in the statement.  \u201cOur mission is to supply energy for modern life and improve living standards around the world while minimizing impacts on the environment.

The agreement, which follows a framework deal announced last October, did not give details on price or timing, or say where the supplies will be sourced.  Exxon Mobil said last year it would deliver the LNG starting in the early 2020s, while LNG supplies to China would come from its global portfolio.  The U.S. firm has been expanding its portfolio of LNG, including from upcoming projects in Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, Qatar and Golden Pass in the United States.  Zhejiang Energy is building a 9 billion yuan ($1.34 billion) receiving terminal for the fuel in Wenzhou, in the eastern province of Zhejiang, with annual handling capacity of 3 million tonnes.  Chinese state oil and gas major Sinopec will be a partner in the terminal.  Chen Zhu, managing director at Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy, said the Exxon-Zhejiang deal was separate from U.S.- China trade negotiations under which Chinese firms are expected to eventually boost purchases of U.S. gas.  \u201cThe gas supplies to the Zhejiang firm will come from Exxon\u2019s portfolio production outside the U.S.,\u201d Chen said, adding that the Wenzhou terminal is likely to be operational in 2022 or 2023.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Exxon shares fell more than 1 percent after the company told analysts attending its annual investor meeting that it plans to lift spending by 10 percent or more for the next several years as rivals are sidelining equipment and capping spending to boost shareholder returns.  Woods defended the strategy of \u201cleaning in as our competitors are leaning back,\u201d saying the best time to buy into projects is not when everyone else is active. \u201cYou do it when everybody else is at home,\u201d Woods said.  Exxon\u2019s plans include a big bet on U.S. shale, where output has surged in recent years, making the United States the world\u2019s largest oil producer.  Exxon shares finished down 91 cents at $79.28 on Wednesday. The stock has underperformed rivals for years and Woods faces challenges to boost investor confidence. He took over as chief executive in 2017, with a mission to boost sagging production and repair missteps made under former CEO Rex Tillerson, including expensive bets on natural gas and Russia.  Capital spending will rise to $33 billion to $35 billion next year from $30 billion this year and from $23.1 billion in Woods\u2019 first year as CEO.  \u201cWith investors increasingly pressuring energy companies to return cash to shareholders, it is no surprise that the higher capital budget was not positively received by the market,\u201d said Muhammed Ghulam, energy analyst with Raymond James.  Over the last five years, Exxon shares have posted a total return of negative 0.16 percent, lagging total returns of 32 percent at Chevron Corp and 54 percent at BP PLC over the same period, while the benchmark S&P 500 index has gained 48 percent, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.  BIG BETS ON SHALE  Exxon\u2019s output has declined in nine of the last 10 quarters, but the company now forecasts continued production gains. It has placed one of its biggest bets on drilling in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. shale field.  The independent oil companies that launched the Permian boom are reducing drilling rigs and cutting spending in response to investor demands to rein in expenses while Exxon and other majors are cranking up investments in the oilfield.  Woods argued that more investment was justified because global demand is rising for oil and gas, and that the declining output of existing wells must be replaced.  \u201cThis is a compelling case for industry as a whole,\u201d Woods said.  This week, Exxon and rival Chevron released dueling Permian output projections. Exxon said its Permian production could hit 1 million barrels of oil and gas per day as early as 2024, up from its previous estimate of 600,000 by 2025.  Both companies have boasted of superior technology to overcome one of shale\u2019s biggest hurdles: rapid declines in production rates. New well production in the Permian was about 600 bpd per rig as of February, down from nearly 760 bpd in mid-2016, according to U.S. Energy Department data.  Woods said Exxon can earn a double-digit return in the Permian even at $35-per-barrel oil. It expects annual cash flow from overall operations to reach $60 billion in 2025, on assumption of $60 per barrel international oil prices.

In a statement on its website, Guyana\u2019s Department of Energy said companies wishing to participate should submit an expression of interest by March 12.  The discovery of oil in the Stabroek block, which is expected to produce some 750,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude by 2025, is set to transform the economy of Guyana, a poor South American country with no history of oil production.  Most of the crude will be lifted by Exxon and its partners, Hess Corp and China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd , with the Guyanese government taking the rest. But without any domestic refining capacity or a national oil company, it must sell the crude on the open market.  The government has already tapped Royal Dutch Shell to lift its first three cargoes. The current search is for a longer-term deal for a marketing agent, which Energy Director Mark Bynoe has said could be a commodities trading firm or an international energy company.  According to the statement, the marketing agent would be expected to lift five cargoes of around 1 million barrels each per year, and the duration of the contract would be 12 months. The firm must have at least five years of experience in oil marketing and trading.  The launch of the search comes ahead of a March 2 presidential election in Guyana. The opposition People\u2019s Progressive Party has pledged to review oil contracts signed under President David Granger\u2019s government should it win the vote.

ISS wrote that the oil company\u2019s newly created position of lead independent director \u201cappears at this time to be robust\u201d despite a general favoring of an independent director as chairman.  The issue has gained greater visibility this year with the company\u2019s first quarterly loss in three decades. Groups disappointed with Exxon\u2019s stance on climate-change measures also have taken up the call for splitting the two roles.  Past attempts to split the roles have routinely fallen well short of winning a majority at prior shareholder meetings. Last year, the proposal was supported by 40.7% of votes cast, up slightly from 38.7% in 2018.  Exxon\u2019s annual meeting is scheduled for May 27.  ISS came out in favor of proposals calling for reports on the company\u2019s political contributions and on its lobbying payments. Both would help Exxon owners assess the risks and benefits from the activities, ISS wrote.  The adviser said Exxon\u2019s lobbying disclosures are \u201cinsufficiently transparent,\u201d and said it does not provide a list of payments to nor membership in trade groups or organizations that may make political contributions.  In its proxy statements, Exxon called for \u201cno\u201d votes for both measures, describing its political donation reports as \u201csufficiently transparent\u201d and noting its lobbying expense information was enhanced this year.

Sale of the oil from the reserve was mandated by previous laws to fund the federal government and to fund a drug program, but the Trump administration took the earliest available time to sell the crude under the law.  The sale\u2019s timing \u201cwould appear to reflect President Donald Trump\u2019s concern regarding oil market tightness associated with the reinstatement of Iran oil sanctions,\u201d analysts at ClearView Energy Partners said after the sale was announced on August 20.  In May, Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear agreement between five other world powers and Tehran. The administration is urging countries to cut purchases of Iranian oil from the Islamic Republic to zero or face possible sanctions after November.  The United States in certain cases will consider waivers for countries that need more time to wind down imports of oil from Iran while reimposing sanctions against Tehran, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said.  Exxon bought about 3.3 million barrels of oil from the reserve, held in a series of underground caverns in Texas and Louisiana. The other companies purchasing the oil were Marathon Petroleum Corp, which bought nearly 1.4 million barrels, Motiva Enterprises LLC, with 2.4 million barrels, Phillips 66, with more than 2 million barrels, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, with nearly 1.6 million barrels, and Valero Energy Corp bought 330,000 barrels.

Exxon also agreed to participate in a provincial project to build an LNG terminal in Huizhou and to supply LNG for it, it said. No details about the capacity of the project or timeline were given.  China is allowing greater access by global majors and local independents to its massive chemicals market to feed plastics, coatings and adhesives to the fast-growing consumer electronics and automotive sectors.  Exxon would be one of only a few international oil majors to invest in LNG infrastructure in China as the country tries to shore up supplies amid a switch to gas-fired boilers by factories and households as part of the government\u2019s battle against smog.  The news comes after German chemical giant BASF announced plans in July to invest $10 billion to build China\u2019s first wholly foreign-owned chemicals complex, also in Guangdong. The project includes a steam cracker producing 1 million tonnes a year of ethylene.  Details of the ownership structure of Exxon\u2019s chemical plant and LNG investment were not released on Thursday.  Still, the deal could be seen as a goodwill gesture by China amid a deepening trade war between the United States and China as the world\u2019s top two economies have traded tit-for-tat punitive tariffs that target $50 billion of each other\u2019s goods.  Washington was holding hearings this week on another round of proposed duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that appear likely to take effect in late September or early October.  The agreement comes a day before a planned meeting in Beijing between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Exxon chairman and chief executive Darren Woods.  LNG PUSH  The preliminary deal was signed with the local governments of Guangdong province and Huizhou as well as state power company, Guangdong Yuedian Group, according to the Guangzhou Daily.  While the petrochemical deal was largely expected following a joint study signed late last year, the push on LNG was a surprise and would mark a second investment in China\u2019s gas infrastructure by an international oil company.  \u201cIt marks a salient step for Exxon in their pursuit of becoming an LNG portfolio player,\u201d said Saul Kavonic, director for Asia Pacific markets and head of energy research at Credit Suisse in Australia.

A price war between the world\u2019s oil powerhouses and fast-declining crude demand have left many producers in Latin America struggling to cover production costs, boosting the chances of output cuts.  Production at the offshore Liza well, which Exxon and partners Hess Corp and China\u2019s CNOOC brought online in December, is expected to reach some 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) in its first phase.  \u201cWe are managing production rates to ensure safe and responsible operations,\u201d Janelle Persaud, Exxon\u2019s public and government affairs adviser in Guyana, said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to monitor the situation closely and will make adjustments as necessary.\u201d  Exxon would have to engage with the Guyanese government before making any adjustments to its operations, the country\u2019s director of energy, Mark Bynoe, told Reuters.  Crude prices climbed on Thursday, with Brent futures approaching $30 a barrel after U.S. President Donald Trump said he expects Russia and Saudi Arabia to announce a major oil production cut.  Projected lifting costs for Liza partners will be just over $10 per barrel of oil for the full year, said Ruaraidh Montgomery, director of research at Houston-based consultancy Welligence.  \u201cI can\u2019t see them shutting down production,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cIt is complex and costly to shut down production and you don\u2019t want to mess around with the reservoir in that way.

Guyana\u2019s government several months ago awarded a contract to Royal Dutch Shell to sell its first three cargoes of oil produced at Liza, or about 3 million barrels in total.  Shell has so far exported one of the three cargoes, according to Bynoe. The next lift allocated to the government and sold to the Anglo-Dutch firm, is scheduled for May, he said.

Exxon posted its third straight quarter of losses on Friday and reduced spending plans for the coming year.  In common with others in the sector, the two are laying off a substantial portion of their workforce and expect to cut costs further as they try to reverse years of weak stock performance, worsened by the impact of movement restrictions.  U.S. oil prices have dropped 41% this year as the coronavirus forced billions of people into lockdowns. Demand recovered in the late northern hemisphere summer, but nations including Germany, India and the United States are again tackling a surge in infections, dampening demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.  The outlook for energy consumption \u201cdepends on when the world - this country and other countries - get control of the pandemic and those activities resume. We don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to be,\u201d said Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber.  Exxon shares were down 1% to $32.62 on Friday. Chevron shares gained 1% to $69.50. Exxon shares have lost half of their value this year; Chevron\u2019s are down 40%.  Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil producer by production, earned $201 million in the most recent quarter, compared with a profit of $2.9 billion for the year-earlier period.

It originally planned to spend $33 billion in capital and exploration investment in 2020, though through three quarters it has instead spent just $16.6 billion.  SHAREHOLDER PAYOUT  Now, however, Exxon is focused on preserving its dividend.  Earlier this week, it announced plans to cut its workforce by about 15% but kept its fourth-quarter dividend at 87 cents a share, making 2020 the first year since 1982 that it has not raised its shareholder payout.  \u201cWhile we see the dividend as safe over the next 12 months, the cash flow outspend is massive under current conditions,\u201d analysts at Raymond James wrote.  The largest U.S. oil producer, which has slashed costs aggressively, is also evaluating whether to hold on to other North American assets. It could write down natural gas assets valued between $25 billion to $30 billion, and possibly part of its Canadian business, Imperial Oil, it said.  \u201cIt is significant that Exxon is explicitly guiding to maintaining the dividend having reduced capex and potentially adding more divestments,\u201d said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors.  Next year, Exxon said capital spending would be between $16 billion to $19 billion, versus an adjusted plan to spend around $23 billion this year.  The company, once the most valuable in the United States by market capitalization, was this month surpassed in value by wind and solar provider NextEra.  In the top U.S. oil field, the Permian Basin shale field, Chevron expects oil and gas output to dip to around 550,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, from 565,000 boepd this quarter, Breber said. It is likely to maintain that level until the global economy recovers.  Exxon\u2019s Permian output was around 401,000 boepd in the third quarter, up from the previous quarter, and it said its costs there had dropped 20%.","97":"FILE PHOTO: An airplane comes in for a landing above an Exxon sign at a gas station in the Chicago suburb of Norridge, Illinois, U.S., October 27, 2016.

Exxon is weighing several factors while deciding whether to invest in the Neptun Deep project in Romania, spokeswoman Julie King said on Wednesday.

France\u2019s Total and Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell scraped out small profits against expectations of losses with the help of the trading units which can exploit market gyrations even when prices fall.  \u201cThese results are driven in particular by the outperformance of trading activities, once again demonstrating the relevance of Total\u2019s integrated model,\u201d Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement.  Earnings of $1.5 billion at Shell\u2019s trading unit in the quarter was about 30 times higher than a year ago. This mirrored Equinor\u2019s results last week, where trading helped the Norwegian company avoid an operating loss.  Oil prices plunged below $16 a barrel in April from above $60 at the start of the year, as daily global crude consumption plunged by as much as a third. Prices have regained some ground since then to trade above $40.  Eni\u2019s refining and marketing unit\u2019s second-quarter profit shot up by 76% to $139 million compared with a year ago, although the company overall still swung to a loss, it said on Thursday.  But trading earnings have not protected the companies from the gloomier longer term prospects for demand. The pandemic has prompted energy firms to slash long-term crude price outlooks, cutting the value of their assets.  France\u2019s Total wrote down $8 billion in the quarter, while Shell cut the value of its assets by $16.8 billion. Eni wrote down 3.5 billion euros ($4.1 billion) and BP, due to report second-quarter results on Aug. 4, has guided for a $17.5 billion hit.  Shell responded to the pandemic by cutting its dividend for the first time since World War Two and lowering planned spending this year by $5 billion to a maximum of $20 billion.  Eni cut its dividend and introduced a new dividend policy based on the oil price. Equinor also cut its dividend and suspended a share buyback.  BP and Total have not cut their dividends.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron have discussed merging. In the fantasy M&A game, Exxon could in theory buy Chevron at a premium, mostly for stock. But Darren Woods may not be investors\u2019 preferred leader for the combined group. Chevron buying Exxon might bring the right chief executive, with Mike Wirth in charge, but a deal that way around could call for too much leverage. There\u2019s a third, way, too: a $400 billion merger of equals.  Exxon is the bigger of the two companies, with a market capitalization of over $210 billion, more than 20% larger than Chevron\u2019s. If it were to offer a 20% premium for its rival, Woods\u2019 Texas-based company could fund the purchase almost entirely with shares and still leave its own shareholders with just over 50% of the combined company, according to a new Breakingviews calculator. And because Chevron has much less debt \u2013 and almost as much EBITDA forecast for 2021, according to Refinitiv data \u2013 Exxon could close the deal looking less leveraged than it is now.  The trouble is that Chevron\u2019s Wirth has proved a better operator, relatively speaking. Since taking the helm in February 2018, shares are off by just over 25% while Exxon\u2019s stock is down by more than 40%. He has also earned the reputation of being a prudent dealmaker, having walked away from buying Anadarko Petroleum at what was a market high.  Picking the right boss is key to a successful merger. If either company offers a meaningful premium for the other, even cutting 5% of combined operating costs, more than $3 billion a year, wouldn\u2019t compensate, once taxed and capitalized. The chief executive of the new fossil-fuel giant would have to do more with less capital expenditure, too.  But Chevron buying Exxon is a stretch. Wirth would have to issue more than $80 billion of debt so that current shareholders could maintain a majority stake. That would jack up the debt-to-EBITDA ratio at Chexxon to nearly 3 times, more than twice the current level.  A merger of equals is the dream answer, ignoring real-world hurdles like antitrust concerns. The market values of the two companies have been converging. Even now they are close enough, at around 55-45, to argue for an equal union. Then it\u2019s a question of sharing out the chief executive and chairman roles, board seats, headquarter locations, and other sensitive goodies. The closer the two get in size, the better the deal looks.

The three blocks will add about 2.6 million net acres to Exxon\u2019s existing holdings in Argentina, the company said. The blocks are located in the Malvinas basin, about 200 miles (320 kms) offshore Tierra del Fuego.  Exxon\u2019s existing Argentina holdings include 315,000 net acres spread over seven blocks in the onshore Neuqu\u00e9n Basin of the Vaca Muerta unconventional oilfield and a business support center in Buenos Aires.  ExxonMobil will have a 70 percent stake, while Qatar Petroleum\u2019s affiliate will hold the rest.  The Argentine government issued a statement on Tuesday saying it received offers for the exploration of three offshore oil and gas basins from 13 companies for a total of $995 million. The country\u2019s energy secretariat was expected to confirm which companies were awarded which areas next month.  Qatar Petroleum signed an agreement with Exxon Mobil in June to buy a 30 percent stake in two of Exxon\u2019s affiliates in Argentina, giving Qatar\u2019s state-owned entity access to oil and gas shale assets in the Latin American country.  Exxon has been investing heavily in its U.S. shale operations and in Guyana. Its development in Argentina has been slow due to several reasons, including the geographic remoteness of the country from U.S. shale operations as well as government controls on natural gas prices.  The U.S. oil company also invested in Brazil\u2019s prolific offshore oilfields throughout 2018, clinching numerous blocks in partnership with other companies. Exxon and Qatar Petroleum International landed Brazil\u2019s Tita area, locking in key real estate in the prized Santos basin.

FILE PHOTO: Darren Woods, Chairman & CEO of Exxon Mobil Corporation attends a news conference at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 1, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  It was unclear how extensive the cuts will be. The largest U.S. oil company slashed this year\u2019s budget by 30% in April, but Chief Executive Darren Woods\u2019s turnaround through rebounding demand and increased asset sales have not panned out and losses are climbing.  On Friday, Exxon is expected to report a $2.63 billion second-quarter loss, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, on sharply lower prices and weaker production, the first back-to-back quarterly losses in at least 36 years. Shares are down 35% so far this year as the coronavirus pandemic has crushed fuel demand.  The latest cost cuts are needed to preserve the company\u2019s nearly $15 billion annual payout to shareholders in the face of rising losses, the people said. Exxon will not generate enough cash from production operations to cover this year\u2019s dividend, analysts have said. It borrowed $18 billion earlier this year to bolster cash.  (For a graphic on Exxon's quarterly results, click: tmsnrt.rs\/3fbJW8P)  Woods so far this year held to the view that oil, natural gas and petrochemicals demand would rebound following an historic crash that saw global consumption fall by roughly one-third and U.S. prices plunge into negative territory in April.  Rivals BP Plc BP.L, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Total TOTF.PA have slashed up to $45 billion in the combined value of their oil and gas properties. Meanwhile, Exxon's 2019 plan to raise $15 billion by 2021 through asset sales has gotten off to a slow start, fizzling this year due to lackluster demand from potential buyers.  With energy prices expected to remain lackluster for years, Woods has turned to spending and staff cuts, and a business restructuring to salvage the payout. Rival Chevron Corp CVX.N has stood out as producing enough cash from operations to cover its dividend.  Even if it does retain its full dividend this year, a cut is \u201ca real possibility in 2021,\u201d given the outlook for oil, said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones. \u201cThere is only so much Exxon can continue to lean on its balance sheet before they start to jeopardize\u201d the payout, Rowland said.  The dividend, which yields about 8% at Wednesday\u2019s closing price of $44.03 a share, is sacrosanct at Exxon, which until this year raised the payout annually for 37 years. Its market value, however, has dropped by half since Woods took over in January 2017.  Exxon has no plans for layoffs due to the pandemic and no percentage targets to reduce its workforce through this year\u2019s employee reviews, said spokesman Casey Norton.  \u201cWe are continually monitoring market conditions and our deep portfolio has flexibility to adjust our plans,\u201d Norton said.  Still, Exxon late last year changed its employee review system, internally referred to as forced ranking. The revision could increase the number of workers who land in the bottom category - to between 8% and 10% up from 3% last year. Those in the bottom category can either strive to meet their manager\u2019s performance goals or leave with 90 days\u2019 pay, person familiar with the matter said.  The ranking applies only to its professional staff. It has 74,900 employees worldwide.  In April, Exxon slashed this year\u2019s capital spending budget to $23 billion, down $10 billion from the start of the year and to the lowest in four years. At the time, Woods said he could further revise spending this year or next.  Prior to the pandemic, Woods had vowed investments in new fields, new and expanded chemical and refining operations would revive Exxon\u2019s earnings and production.  In early 2019, he predicted investments in production and refining could produce a $4 billion increase in earnings this year over last and reach up to $21.5 billion by 2025 at $40 a barrel oil, slightly below the current price.  Woods also set a target to bring in $15 billion from asset sales between 2019 through 2021. Last year, it the sales brought in nearly $3.7 billion but proceeds this year are only $86 million.  \u201cIt has fallen a bit behind schedule but there have been reports there are several packages out,\u201d said Cowen analyst Jason Gabelman, who expects Exxon to reiterate the asset sale target on Friday.  Wall Street will watch for new capital and operating expense cuts \u201cand other available levers to defend the dividend,\u201d Gabelman said.","104":"(Repeats to additional customers)  HOUSTON\/SINGAPORE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - In the middle of a Sino-U.S. trade war, the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil and gas company is turning toward Beijing for business at a time when most of Corporate America is looking elsewhere to avoid the threat of tariffs.  Exxon Mobil Corp is placing big bets on China\u2019s soaring liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand, coupling multi-billion dollar production projects around the world with its first mainland storage and distribution outlet.  Its gas strategy is moving on two tracks: expanding output of the super-cooled gas in places such as Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, and creating demand for those supplies in China by opening Exxon\u2019s first import and storage hub, according to an Exxon manager and people briefed on the company\u2019s plans.  That combination \u201cwill guarantee us a steady outlet for lots of our LNG for decades,\u201d said the Exxon manager who was not authorized to discuss the project and spoke on condition of anonymity. One of the company\u2019s top policy goals this year, the manager said, is building its Chinese client roster.  \u201cChina\u2019s natural gas demand is rising really fast, with imports soaring well over 10 percent annually at the moment because of the government gasification program and due to fast rising industrial demand, including in petrochemicals,\u201d the Exxon manager said.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2CwGQgT  An Exxon spokesperson declined to provide an executive to discuss the company\u2019s LNG investments in China.  Years in the making, the strategy delivers an added benefit: helping Exxon sidestep a global trade war. Exxon\u2019s massive LNG projects in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique will not incur the 10 percent tariff China put on U.S. gas as part of the trade war between the Trump administration and Beijing.  Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at LNG tanker brokers Poten & Partners, which tracks LNG sales, said the deal provides \u201ca sign that China is willing to let foreign interests invest in things that in the past were seen as strategic.\u201d  Exxon is among the top ranked U.S. companies that are pushing ahead in China despite the trade dispute, but it is not alone. U.S. and European car makers are opening or expanding China plants to avoid hefty tariffs and transport costs. Tesla Inc this month acquired a Shanghai site for a car and battery-manufacturing complex.  Exxon\u2019s Asian and African LNG will offer a cost advantage over U.S. rivals\u2019 exports that face tariffs and greater transport, while China\u2019s support for the project offers a rebuttal to Trump administration complaints about the country\u2019s closed markets.  The decision to expand its LNG production and open an import terminal in the world\u2019s fastest growing LNG market is a step by Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods to pull the company out of an earnings rut that has left its shares flat over the past seven years.  TRADE WAR RISKS  Woods appeared holding discussions with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on state-run media last month days after disclosing local approvals for the LNG terminal and a massive chemical project in Guangdong province. Since becoming CEO last year, Woods has pushed Exxon to take greater risks, including in energy trading operations.  His timing with LNG is key. Next year, China will become the world\u2019s largest importer of natural gas, and its LNG imports are forecast to rise 70 percent by 2020, from 38.1 million tonnes last year, estimates Beijing consultancy SIA Energy.  Exxon has not publicly named its partner in the import terminal. State-run power company Guangdong Yuedian Group said on its website it will join the project. BP Plc is the only other foreign oil major with a stake in a Chinese LNG terminal.  Yuedian did not respond to a request for comment.  The multi-billion dollar bets still faces risks from the Sino-U.S. trade dispute. China has vowed to respond to any new tariffs by the Trump administration, which recently accused China of meddling in November elections and trying to recruit Americans to spy for it. But it remains unclear what that response will be and if it puts agreements like Exxon\u2019s in China in jeopardy.  In addition to the LNG terminal, Exxon received approval for its first wholly-owned chemical plant in China, becoming one of two foreign firms including Germany\u2019s BASF to gain approval to operate such plants without a local sponsor.  The terminal and chemicals plants combined will cost about $9 billion to build, consultancy IHS Markit estimates.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2wDdglt  CALL FOR NEW PROJECTS  China in 2017 embarked on a huge program to shift millions of households and factories from coal to natural gas for power and heating, a move to clear the smoggy skies over its cities.  That surge has injected new life into an LNG industry that suffered from plunging prices between 2014 and 2017, which forced energy companies to put off liquefaction projects.  But with prices for LNG rising this year, major producers have boosted investment. In addition to Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell PLC this month gave the go-ahead to a $31 billion LNG Canada project that will export fuel primarily to China.  \u201cMajor Independent Oil Companies such as Exxon aim for large-scale tier one positions, and in the LNG game that is Qatar, East Africa, and possibly some North American and Papua New Guinea projects,\u201d said Saul Kavonic, oil and gas researcher for Credit Suisse in Sydney, Australia.  Exxon and other LNG producers also are adapting to changing buyer behavior. In the past, LNG was dominated by long-term supply contracts - especially with Japanese and South Korean buyers - that could span several decades and in which buyer and seller agree to a fixed monthly volume at a set price formula, usually priced off crude oil.  That is changing, in part because China\u2019s importers either demand more contract flexibility or simply buy LNG at short-notice in the spot market whenever they need it.  The shift away from such rigid price-supply deals is forcing producers to trade new LNG supplies and give import terminals a larger role in encouraging spot purchases.  \u201cLNG players are increasingly adopting an LNG portfolio model whereby supply projects are not directly linked to end customers, with over 50 percent of contracts now coming from portfolio suppliers rather than specific projects,\u201d said Credit Suisse\u2019s Kavonic.","105":"A booth of U.S. major ExxonMobil is seen at the China (Dongying) International Petrochemical Trade Exhibition in Dongying, Shandong province, China May 29, 2018.

The world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil producer last year launched a major push into energy trading, hiring veterans from Glencore, Noble Group, BP Plc and elsewhere in the United States, Europe and Asia. It also recruited market analysts and specialists with experience in crude, natural gas, gas-liquids and gasoline.  The trading unit\u2019s pre-tax gains and losses averaged $230 million in each quarter of 2018, according to a presentation delivered to analysts last week at the Scotia Howard Weil investor conference. For the full year, trading provided an operating profit of $10 million, up from a $99 million loss in the prior year, according to a regulatory filing.  The profit was a fraction of Exxon\u2019s $20.8 billion in earnings last year. But the disclosure of even an range of operating profit was a milestone in shedding light on its fledging business.  Rivals Royal Dutch Shell and BP, which have larger commodities trading businesses, traditionally also have not provided detailed results for that activity. Shell for instance wraps its trading results in with its oil refining business. BP also includes its trading as part of its downstream operations.  Comparing the majors\u2019 operations are difficult because of the lack of consistent and specific financial disclosures, said Lysle Brinker, executive director of upstream equity research and analysis at energy consultancy IHSMarkit.  \u201cExxon Mobil has not historically been into that business, but they\u2019re getting into it now,\u201d Brinker said. \u201cThey realize now they probably can be just as successful as the other guys.\u201d  An Exxon spokesman declined comment, pointing to the quarterly range figures in the presentation and full-year results in its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Under Chief Executive Darren Woods, Exxon has sought to use trading to boost earnings, applying its knowledge of regional oil and gas prices, and its extensive array of pipelines, storage terminals, ships and railcars to profit from price differentials around the globe. It also has bulked up its risk management systems.","107":"ATHENS, July 3 (Reuters) - A consortium of U.S. Exxon Mobil , France\u2019s Total and Hellenic Petroleum has been awarded a tender to explore for oil and gas off Greece, the energy ministry said on Tuesday.

The Wink-to-Webster pipeline will connect the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Texas Gulf Coast, and comes when booming production has led to tight pipeline capacity in the lucrative shale basin, resulting in lower prices for regional crude.

If Exxon sees an opportunity it has the balance sheet to \u201cbe in a position to transact on that,\u201d Woods said, but he added that \u201ctime\u2019s on our side.\u201d  Chevron Corp CVX.N also will take an \"opportunistic\" approach in the basin, said Jeff Gustavson, vice president of Chevron's Mid-Continent business, at the Barclays conference.  \u201cWe\u2019re always looking,\u201d but Gustavson said the company is not under \u201cany pressure to transact.\u201d  \"I think we demonstrated that earlier this year,\" Gustavson added. Chevron had struck a deal this spring to buy Anadarko Petroleum APC.N, which ultimately accepted a higher offer from Occidental Petroleum OXY.N. Chevron did not make a second bid for Anadarko and its Permian Basin holdings.  Woods this year set a target of raising $15 billion by trimming Exxon\u2019s portfolio through 2021 above the average $3.3 billion a year rate between 2013 and 2017. Sales so far have been sluggish.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo\/File Photo  Shares of both companies rose about 3 percent.  The two U.S. oil majors missed the first stage of the shale boom in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico and have been investing billions of dollars to make up for lost time. They are betting their size and other businesses offer advantages smaller producers cannot duplicate.  Combined, the two companies pumped 677,000 barrels of oil and gas per day in the shale field last quarter, close to a fifth of the region\u2019s total oil production, according to figures released on Friday.  Exxon said its fourth-quarter Permian production was 300,000 barrels of oil and gas per day, up 93 percent from a year ago and up 12 percent over the third quarter. Chevron\u2019s output in the Permian jumped to 377,000 barrels per day, up 84 percent from the same period a year earlier.  \u201cIn just two years we have doubled our rig count, increased our resource base, decreased unit development and operating costs, and more than doubled our production,\u201d Chevron Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said on an earnings call.  Both companies are tying their shale operations to logistics and refining arms that independents do not have.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to be advantaged versus the rest of industry,\u201d Exxon CEO Darren Woods said on an earnings call, noting the company\u2019s close coupling of pipeline, logistics and oil refining operations to shale.  In nine of the previous 10 quarters Exxon\u2019s overall oil and gas output dropped, but its fourth-quarter production edged up to just over 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, from 3.9 million in the year-ago period.  Production at Exxon, the nation\u2019s largest oil and gas producer, was \u201cvery strong,\u201d said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones.  The Permian, now producing 3.85 million barrels per day, is forecast to generate 5.4 million barrels per day by 2023, greater than any single OPEC member other than Saudi Arabia, according to consultancy IHS Markit.  Shale fields\u2019 fast payoff is lifting both companies\u2019 earnings and cash flow. Chevron generated $9.2 billion in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter, up from $8.0 billion a year earlier. Its 2019 capital spending budget is going toward projects that can deliver cash within two years, Wirth said.  Exxon, in addition to shale, continues to invest heavily in major refining, chemical and offshore projects.  That has not sat well with some investors. Its stock is off 13 percent in the 12 months ended Jan. 31. Exxon is the only international oil company \u201cnot currently repurchasing shares,\u201d Simmons Energy said in a note.  Exxon shares were up 3.03 percent at $75.50 in afternoon trading, and Chevron shares were up 3.04 percent at $118.13.  Exxon\u2019s fourth-quarter net income fell to $6 billion, or $1.41 a share, from $8.38 billion a year ago, when results benefited substantially from the impact of U.S. tax reform. Excluding the impacts of tax reform and asset impairments, earnings rose to $6.4 billion from $3.73 billion a year ago.  Chevron reported a quarterly profit of $3.7 billion, or $1.95 per share, compared with $3.11 billion, or $1.64 a share, a year earlier.","115":"(Corrects to Thursday, from Friday, in first pargraph)  NEW YORK, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Lawyers for New York state and Exxon Mobil Corp will make closing arguments on Thursday in the closely watched trial in the state\u2019s lawsuit charging that the oil major hid from its investors the true costs of regulations aimed at curbing climate change.  The case, filed in October 2018 in Manhattan state court, was the first of several climate-related lawsuits against major oil companies to go to trial. It featured testimony from investors, experts and former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson, who flatly denied the allegations against the company.  The attorney general alleges that Exxon caused investors to lose up to $1.6 billion by falsely telling them it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business.  The company used a \u201cproxy cost\u201d of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions in wealthy countries by 2040, but internally used figures as low as $40 per ton or none at all, the attorney general said.  Tillerson testified that the proxy cost represented \u201cmacro level\u201d assessment of the likely effect of future carbon regulations around the world on demand for fossil fuels, and was incorporated into a data guide used throughout Exxon.  Separately, he said, the company evaluated greenhouse gas costs at a \u201cmicro level\u201d for specific projects, when appropriate.  Exxon\u2019s lawyer, Theodore Wells, said in his opening statement in the trial that the attorney general\u2019s case wrongly conflated proxy costs with those project-specific costs. In fact, he said, the company consistently used both and never misled investors about them.  There is no jury in the trial, meaning the verdict will be decided by Justice Barry Ostrager.  Last month, just two days after the New York trial began, Massachusetts filed a similar lawsuit accusing Exxon of misleading investors and consumers for decades about the role fossil fuels play in climate change.  Both Massachusetts and New York began investigating Exxon after news reports in 2015 saying company scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.  Exxon and other oil companies including BP Plc, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc face lawsuits by cities and counties across the United States seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels brought on by climate change.  The companies have said in court filings that they cannot be held liable for climate change.

While Exxon's sale process was never officially suspended, it was put on the backburner when Chevron started negotiations with Hungarian energy firm MOL MOLB.BU for the sale of its assets last year, which led to a $1.57 billion deal in November.  Exxon\u2019s process, run by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, was recently relaunched despite oil prices halving to around $30 a barrel after a historic collapse in oil consumption due to coronavirus-linked lockdowns that restricted people\u2019s movement.  \u201cExxon Mobil is testing market interest for its non-operated producing assets in Azerbaijan,\u201d Exxon spokeswoman Julie King told Reuters.  Exxon routinely evaluates its producing portfolio and \u201cif other companies find more value in an asset, we will sell,\u201d she added.  A number of Asian national oil companies, including China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), India\u2019s ONGC and Indonesia\u2019s Pertamina, have shown interest in the stake recently, hoping to clinch a deal at a lower price than before, according to four industry and banking sources.  It was unclear how much Exxon was seeking to raise from the sale, but it is likely to be valued significantly lower than Chevron\u2019s stake, the sources said.  A spokesman for SOCAR, Azerbaijan\u2019s national oil company declined to comment. BAML declined to comment, and Pertamina did not respond to requests for comment.  ONGC did not respond to a request for comment. An Indian industry source said, however, that ONGC, which holds a stake in ACG, had yet to decide whether to bid for Exxon\u2019s stake and was in talks with other partners in the field.  China's CNOOC Ltd 0883.HK and parent company China National Offshore Oil Company, or CNOOC, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.  The sharp drop in oil prices pushed Exxon into its first quarterly loss in decades in the first three months of the year and the Irving, Texas-based company cut its spending by 30%.  Exxon last year launched a plan to divest up to $25 billion of oil and gas fields in Europe, Asia and Africa as it sharpened its focus on a handful of mega projects at home and abroad.  The effort so far has fallen short of returning asset sale proceeds to a prior average of $5 billion a year. Exxon has sold assets in Norway for $4.5 billion and has launched processes in Australia, Malaysia and Nigeria.  The launch of a number of processes, including the sale of its British North Sea oil and gas portfolio have been put on hold following the collapse in oil prices, according to sources.  For Exxon, the sale of its operations in Azerbaijan would mark the end of a 25-year involvement.  Exxon and Chevron were among five U.S. oil companies that helped create Azerbaijan\u2019s current oil industry soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union and acquiring a stake in ACG in 1994.  The deal was dubbed by Azerbaijan and partners as the \u201cthe contract of the century\u201d thanks to the field\u2019s large reserves and hopes for future major discoveries that would help Europe diversify away from Russian oil and gas.","118":"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - ExxonMobil said on Thursday that it has imported a liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargo to keep tanks cold at its Papua New Guinea LNG facilities near the capital Port Moresby, confirming an earlier Reuters report.

Exxon\u2019s PNG LNG export plant was shut in late February after a powerful earthquake disrupted feed-gas supplies from the gas-producing Highlands region.  \u201cIn addition, a small amount of gas is used as a fuel source for the plant\u2019s gas turbine generators, which help keep the plant in safe operating condition,\u201d the spokeswoman said.  The generators are also continuing to supply some of Port Moresby\u2019s power demand, she said.  \u201cThe purchase of this cargo does not reflect a change in our earlier projection of eight weeks for return to production,\u201d she added.  Reuters reported in March that Exxon bought an LNG cargo for early April delivery to keep the LNG plant cool.  Stopping the liquefaction process which condenses gas into liquid at minus 162 degrees Celsius causes LNG plants to warm up, requiring cargoes to be imported to keep cryogenic tanks and equipment operational.  The 172,000-cubic meter capacity LNG tanker Kumul, custom-built for the PNG LNG project, is currently moored at the terminal, after discharging a cargo on Thursday, Thomson Reuters Eikon shiptracking data showed.  The 170,000-cubic meter capacity LNG tanker Papua is currently anchored near Port Moresby, according to the data. Traders said this tanker could be standing by ready to load once an export cargo is available, though this could not be officially confirmed with Exxon.

Chevron expects shale production from the basin to reach 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) by the end of next year, 59 percent above current production, and 900,000 bpd by the end of 2023, it said at its annual meeting with equity analysts in New York.  The stakes are such that Exxon on Tuesday forecast shale production of 1 million barrels per day in the Permian as early as 2024, grabbing the spotlight on the day Chevron was making a case in its oil growth.  \u201cOur investors don\u2019t need to wait several years for the story to come together,\u201d Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an apparent dig at Exxon, which has been investing heavily in the Permian to reverse production declines. \u201cWe\u2019re delivering now.\u201d  The Permian Basin pumps around 4 million barrels per day now and IHS Markit expects it to hit 5.4 mbd in 2023, more than the total production of any OPEC country other than Saudi Arabia.

He said, however, that Chevron\u2019s production could exceed 900,000 barrels daily if the company decided to increase drilling rigs from the 20 currently in operation.  \u201cIt\u2019s a decision we haven\u2019t taken yet but we certainly have it under active consideration,\u201d Wirth said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good story that could get even better.\u201d  Oil companies are trying to win back investors after years of underperforming other industrial sectors and the S&P 500. The weighting of energy shares in the S&P 500 index fell to 6 percent in 2018, from 8.4 percent four years earlier.  Like Exxon, Chevron has begun to emphasize achieving faster payoffs from investments in shale rather than the megaprojects of the past.  \u201cThe key driver of cash flow growth over the medium term remains the Permian, which continues to perform ahead of expectations,\u201d said Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited.

Executives said the company would return more cash to investors this year through dividends and $4 billion in share buybacks aiming to achieve a 6 percent shareholder return.  The company also raised its estimate of its reserves in the Permian, in Texas and New Mexico, to 16.2 billion barrels of recoverable resources from 9 billion.

ExxonMobil\/Handout via REUTERS\/File Photo  Exxon Mobil Corp is placing big bets on China\u2019s soaring liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand, coupling multi-billion dollar production projects around the world with its first mainland storage and distribution outlet.  Its gas strategy is moving on two tracks: expanding output of the super-cooled gas in places such as Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, and creating demand for those supplies in China by opening Exxon\u2019s first import and storage hub, according to an Exxon manager and people briefed on the company\u2019s plans.  That combination \u201cwill guarantee us a steady outlet for lots of our LNG for decades,\u201d said the Exxon manager who was not authorized to discuss the project and spoke on condition of anonymity. One of the company\u2019s top policy goals this year, the manager said, is building its Chinese client roster.  \u201cChina\u2019s natural gas demand is rising really fast, with imports soaring well over 10 percent annually at the moment because of the government gasification program and due to fast rising industrial demand, including in petrochemicals,\u201d the Exxon manager said.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2CwGQgT  An Exxon spokesperson declined to provide an executive to discuss the company\u2019s LNG investments in China.  Exxon said last month it would participate in the construction of an LNG import terminal in Huizhou, Guangdong region and provide supplies to it. This makes it only the second foreign major with such a stake in an LNG terminal.  Years in the making, the strategy delivers an added benefit: helping Exxon sidestep a global trade war. Exxon\u2019s massive LNG projects in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique will not incur the 10 percent tariff China put on U.S. gas as part of the trade war between the Trump administration and Beijing.  Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at LNG tanker brokers Poten & Partners, which tracks LNG sales, said the deal provides \u201ca sign that China is willing to let foreign interests invest in things that in the past were seen as strategic.\u201d  Exxon is among the top ranked U.S. companies that are pushing ahead in China despite the trade dispute, but it is not alone. U.S. and European car makers are opening or expanding China plants to avoid hefty tariffs and transport costs. Tesla Inc this month acquired a Shanghai site for a car and battery-manufacturing complex.  Exxon\u2019s Asian and African LNG will offer a cost advantage over U.S. rivals\u2019 exports that face tariffs and greater transport, while China\u2019s support for the project offers a rebuttal to Trump administration complaints about the country\u2019s closed markets.  The decision to expand its LNG production and open an import terminal in the world\u2019s fastest growing LNG market is a step by Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods to pull the company out of an earnings rut that has left its shares flat over the past seven years.  TRADE WAR RISKS  Woods appeared holding discussions with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on state-run media last month days after disclosing local approvals for the LNG terminal and a massive chemical project. Since becoming CEO last year, Woods has pushed Exxon to take greater risks, including in energy trading operations.  His timing with LNG is key. Next year, China will become the world\u2019s largest importer of natural gas, and its LNG imports are forecast to rise 70 percent by 2020, from 38.1 million tonnes last year, estimates Beijing consultancy SIA Energy.  Exxon has not publicly named its partner in the import terminal. State-run power company Guangdong Yuedian Group said on its website it will join the project. BP Plc is the only other foreign major with a stake in a Chinese LNG terminal.  Yuedian did not respond to a request for comment.  The multi-billion dollar bets still faces risks from the Sino-U.S. trade dispute. China has vowed to respond to any new tariffs by the Trump administration, which recently accused China of meddling in November elections and trying to recruit Americans to spy for it. But it remains unclear what that response will be and if it puts agreements like Exxon\u2019s in China in jeopardy.  In addition to the LNG terminal, Exxon received approval for its first wholly-owned chemical plant in China, becoming one of two foreign firms including Germany\u2019s BASF to gain approval to operate such plants without a local sponsor.  The terminal and chemicals plants combined will cost about $9 billion to build, consultancy IHS Markit estimates.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2wDdglt  CALL FOR NEW PROJECTS  China in 2017 embarked on a huge program to shift millions of households and factories from coal to natural gas for power and heating, a move to clear the smoggy skies over its cities.  That surge has injected new life into an LNG industry that suffered from plunging prices between 2014 and 2017, which forced energy companies to put off liquefaction projects.  But with prices for LNG rising this year, major producers have boosted investment. In addition to Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell PLC this month gave the go-ahead to a $31 billion LNG Canada project that will export fuel primarily to China.  \u201cMajor Independent Oil Companies such as Exxon aim for large-scale tier one positions, and in the LNG game that is Qatar, East Africa, and possibly some North American and Papua New Guinea projects,\u201d said Saul Kavonic, oil and gas researcher for Credit Suisse in Sydney, Australia.  Exxon and other LNG producers also are adapting to changing buyer behavior. In the past, LNG was dominated by long-term supply contracts - especially with Japanese and South Korean buyers - that could span several decades and in which buyer and seller agree to a fixed monthly volume at a set price formula, usually priced off crude oil.  That is changing, in part because China\u2019s importers either demand more contract flexibility or simply buy LNG at short-notice in the spot market whenever they need it.  The shift away from such rigid price-supply deals is forcing producers to trade new LNG supplies and give import terminals a larger role in encouraging spot purchases.  \u201cLNG players are increasingly adopting an LNG portfolio model whereby supply projects are not directly linked to end customers, with over 50 percent of contracts now coming from portfolio suppliers rather than specific projects,\u201d said Credit Suisse\u2019s Kavonic.","125":"March 1 (Reuters) - A proposed expansion of an Exxon Mobil Corp oil refinery could be impacted by the Trump administration\u2019s plan to place a 25 percent tariff on imported steel, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.

FILE PHOTO: An Exxon sign is seen at a gas station in the Chicago suburb of Norridge, Illinois, U.S., October 27, 2016. REUTERS\/Jim Young  The talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement.  The field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects.  The volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 \u201cunitisation\u201d - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and France\u2019s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said.  The companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.  Across the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last year\u2019s record level of approvals for plants.  Success in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now don\u2019t expect until early 2022.  The FID on Total\u2019s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.  The current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.  It allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the \u201cstraddling\u201d reserves, with a 50\/50 share in phase one of development.  Now Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projects\u2019 annual LNG production, according to the sources.  \u201cThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,\u201d said one of the sources.  Asked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: \u201cAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.\u201d  \u201cExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,\u201d he added.  Total said the operators of the two projects \u201ccontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of development\u201d.  Mozambique\u2019s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reuters\u2019 questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nation\u2019s energy development.  The INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.  BOOSTING PRODUCTION  A Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxon\u2019s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.  Instead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.  This would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovuma\u2019s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.  Mozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.  Reuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.  A fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.  In April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.  The Mozambique government has said it expects Exxon\u2019s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.  In response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: \u201cWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.\u201d  Area 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNG\u2019s licence area.  SHADOW OF INSURGENCY  While Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.  It would mean the company wouldn\u2019t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.  However the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projects\u2019 doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.  Analysts warn the group\u2019s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.  One of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.  \u201cThe investment will not be viable without security,\u201d the official said.","132":"(Adds quotes, color, background)  WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - The leaders of two of the world\u2019s largest energy companies said on Tuesday they worry a trade conflict between the United States and other nations could destabilize the global economy.

While one-time asset sales or write downs were large factors, the two companies said earnings suffered from weaker margins in crude oil, chemicals and fuel production. They gave tepid outlooks for the near term.  Shares of Exxon and Chevron were both at least 3% lower in morning trade on the results and worries about slowing global economic growth.  Fourth-quarter results at Exxon fell below Wall Street\u2019s recently lowered estimate, with earnings sliding to $5.6 billion from $6 billion a year ago. Per share profit excluding one-time gain from asset sales was 41 cents, below Wall Street\u2019s estimate of 43 cents and 71 cents prior to a recent warning.  Chevron swung to a loss of $6.61 billion from a year-earlier profit of $3.73 billion. The company had $10 billion in charges including writedowns on the value of oil and gas properties that were no longer economic to pump. Excluding charges, its $1.49 cent a share profit topped estimates.  This week, Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s shares hit a three-year low after it laid out a plan to pull back on share buybacks amid slower global growth and weak commodity prices.  Exxon CEO Darren Woods said its natural gas, refining and chemicals businesses have suffered from prices near or at decade lows. Exxon will keep investing in new projects on the belief that a growing global middle class will drive demand for its products, Woods said, describing the margin weakness as \u201ca short-term impact.\u201d  Exxon and Chevron are racing in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, to reach 1 million barrels per day of production, but neither is anywhere near that level right now.

Both companies have a goal of 1 million bpd within a few years.  Values are down across the oil and gas sector, prompting ongoing speculation that large companies will acquire smaller ones in the Permian Basin. Woods, though, said that the best opportunities are usually the ones \u201cthat you can generate organically,\u201d while Chevron CEO Mike Wirth repeated a pledge to maintain capital discipline.","139":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Exxon Mobil Corporation is shown on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, December 30, 2015.

The petitioners demand drilling be stopped immediately, or at least capped at 12 bcm per year, a level the Dutch gas regulator last year said would limit risks.  \u201cWe need two to three years to get at 12 bcm, it\u2019s impossible to reach it straight away without disrupting consequences,\u201d Besselink said .  The government expects the 12 bcm level might be reached by the end of 2020, by switching large industrial users away from Groningen gas and by building extra capacity to convert high-caloric imported gas to the low-caloric gas needed for the Dutch network.  The Netherlands still depends on Groningen gas for a significant part of its energy supply and export obligations.  The High Court in 2017 said certainty of supply should play a role in decisions on the production level, but should not outweigh safety concerns.  The court expects to deliver its verdict on Jan. 31. It will also hear 26 other complaints from local authorities and interest groups in April.","146":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of Exxon Mobil is displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017.

The contribution, made to the Americans for Carbon Dividends political action committee of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), was disclosed by the group on Tuesday, less than a month after Exxon agreed to contribute $100 million to oil companies\u2019 efforts to develop technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  \u201cApplying a uniform cost across the economy is consistent with our principles on how to manage the risk of climate change,\u201d Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019ve been supportive of a revenue-neutral price on carbon for a decade.\u201d  The $1 million contribution will be spread over two years.  Exxon, the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil company, has supported a carbon tax in the past and has stepped up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in its operations. Those efforts came amid lawsuits brought by U.S. city and state officials seeking damages to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels that result from global warming.  The Climate Leadership Council\u2019s PAC aims to spend $5 million on an initial lobbying campaign to win support for the tax, said Greg Bertelsen, senior vice president at the group.  \u201cWe\u2019re in the very early days of this organization,\u201d said Bertelsen, who said the PAC is looking to build legislative support for its carbon tax. It proposes an initial $40-a-ton tax on carbon dioxide that would increase over time, with the money raised to be returned to consumers.  The PAC, led by former U.S. Senators John Breaux and Trent Lott, also has raised $1 million each from Exelon Corp, First Solar Inc and the American Wind Energy Association, he said. It expects to reach its goal of a $5 million in coming months, he said.  The council\u2019s proposal was developed by former Secretaries of State James Baker and George Schultz.

The deal includes ownership interests in more than 20 producing fields mostly operated by local producer Equinor with a combined production of about 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019.  ExxonMobil, which will hang on to its refining operations and retail network in the country, said the sale was expected to close in the last quarter of this year.  The transaction is part of the U.S. major\u2019s plans to divest about $15 billion in nonstrategic assets by 2021.  Reuters had exclusively reported earlier this month that Exxon had agreed to sell its Norwegian assets.  In a separate statement, Var Energi, 69.6% owned by Italian major Eni SpA, said the acquisition would make it the No. 2 exploration and production company in the area with overall resources of 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe).  Total production is expected to be around 300,000 boe per day in 2019 and will grow to more than 350,000 in 2023 as it invests some $7 billion in development projects.  \u201cThe acquired assets complement and strengthen Var Energi in core areas ... and open up new opportunities for growth,\u201d said Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi.  Eni set up the unit, which is 30.4% owned by Norwegian private equity HitecVision, at the end of 2018.  A source familiar with the matter said the deal meant Eni would have an equity production from operations of 220,000 boe per day, double what it had forecast a year ago.  Var Energi said it would fund the deal with existing cash resources and a loan fully underwritten by BNP Paribas.","152":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are slamming the brakes on oil output, as the top two U.S. producers plan for combined global shut-ins of 800,000 barrels per day in response to plunging crude prices and fuel demand.  Both companies on Friday outlined deep cuts in investments in the Permian shale basin, the top U.S. oilfield where growth in recent years made America the world\u2019s top oil producer and a net exporter for the first time in decades. They each announced global shut-ins of up to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) this quarter due to lockdowns to fight the coronavirus pandemic.  Exxon and Chevron have been sidelining Permian drilling equipment since the market started crashing in March. U.S. crude prices have plunged nearly 70% this year to under $20 a barrel, and traded in negative territory on April 20 for the first time ever.  Oil and gas output at both U.S. producers rose in the first quarter with the companies racing to produce 1 million barrels per day in the Permian. Then fuel demand sank nearly a third due to travel and business lockdowns, while a flood of Russian and Saudi oil hit the market when they abandoned production cuts.  \u201cWe would intend to bring activity back to the Permian when we see prices recover,\u201d Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said in an interview.  The two oil majors spent heavily in the last two years to expand in the Permian. Shale production can be brought on faster than deepwater and other oil exploration projects but requires near-constant drilling to maintain output.  Exxon\u2019s biggest cuts will come in the Permian, \u201cwhere the short-cycle investments are more readily adjusted,\u201d said Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods.  FILE PHOTO: A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Sergio Moraes  He added that because shale wells produce big volumes at first and then decline rapidly, it is \u201cbeneficial in long term\u201d to ensure \u201cwe\u2019re bringing those high production rates into a market that\u2019s more conducive.\u201d Exxon will sideline 75% of its Permian drilling rigs, keeping 15 working.  The company posted a $610 million first-quarter loss, its first quarterly loss in three decades, on a nearly $3 billion inventory writedown reflecting lower margins and prices. Chevron posted a $3.6 billion profit on asset sales and improved refining results, and also said it would further reduce spending this year.  (For a graphic on Exxon's earnings, click here: )  Both companies will slash spending budgets by 30% this year. Chevron cut its capital spending budget to $14 billion and Exxon has set 2020 spending at $23 billion, the lowest in four years.  Even though their results topped Wall Street\u2019s reduced estimates, Exxon shares fell 7% to $43.14 while Chevron dropped 2.8% to $89.44.  Chevron\u2019s additional spending cuts will help it pay for its dividend and make it \u201ca defensive energy holding and a relative safe haven in very stormy seas,\u201d said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones.  Exxon\u2019s balance sheet \u201cis strong enough to withstand the current environment,\u201d but it needs oil prices around $75 per barrel this year to break even versus around $50 on average for its peers, said Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited.  U.S. crude futures have recovered a bit since settling in negative territory on April 20, but the current price of around $19 per barrel remains below the cost of production for many. International oil prices are around $26 per barrel.  Both Chevron and Exxon maintained their quarterly dividends.  Other oil majors are also slashing investments and seeking ways to conserve cash. Royal Dutch Shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two and reported first-quarter profits down nearly half compared to a year-ago. BP Plc\u2019s first-quarter profit tumbled by two-thirds and its debt climbed to its highest on record.","153":"(Repeats story published late Wednesday, with no change to text)  HOUSTON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Wednesday kept its fourth-quarter dividend flat at 87 cents a share, signaling 2020 will be the first year since 1982 that the U.S. oil producer has not raised its shareholder payout.  The largest U.S. oil producer by volume was caught off guard by the sharp decline in energy prices and demand this year. U.S. prices are off 39% since the start of the year and globally demand has tumbled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Exxon has pledged cost and jobs cuts that could be announced as early as Friday. The decision to retain the quarterly dividend could indicate it expects margin improvements from cost-cutting will allow it to continue making the hefty payout.  At $3.48 per share, the annual dividend is equal to 10.6% of its share price.  The company posted its first back-to-back quarterly losses this year and is projected to report a full-year $2 billion loss, Refinitiv estimates show, excluding asset sales or write downs. It reports third-quarter financial results on Friday.  Exxon has a \u201cnarrow path\u201d to maintain the dividend without borrowing more, said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov. Even with U.S. oil prices trading around $45 per barrel, the dividend would deplete the company\u2019s cash balance by the end of 2021, he said.  BP PLC, Equinor ASA and Royal Dutch Shell PLC earlier this year cut their shareholder payouts by at least half.  Four years ago, Exxon stopped buying back its own shares, giving greater prominence to the dividend, which reached $14.7 billion last year. Officials said in July they were committed to maintaining the dividend.  \u201cWe have doubts about the sanctity of the dividend longer-term,\u201d said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. \u201cThere is greater potential for a dividend reduction in 2021 if demand doesn\u2019t fully recover.\u201d  Exxon shares traded at $31.57 on Wednesday, down 3.8%, and at the lowest point in more than two decades. The dividend announcement came after market close.

While his People\u2019s Progressive Party (PPP) has criticized President David Granger\u2019s 2016 deal with Exxon as too generous, Irfaan Ali called the company - whose 1 million barrel cargo of Guyana\u2019s first-ever crude production set sail on Monday - a \u201cpioneer\u201d in an interview over the weekend.

Others have not yet confirmed commercial finds. Tullow has made several discoveries in the past year, but the company has yet to find enough reserves to make the project work.  Granger\u2019s government has defended its deal with Exxon, which includes a 2% royalty and a 50% profit share after the company recoups its costs, noting that attractive terms were needed to secure investment in a risky new location.  That will bring Guyana around $230 million in government revenue in 2020 and nearly $2 billion total by 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a substantial boost for an underdeveloped country of less than 800,000 people whose central government spent just $1.2 billion in 2018.  Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said \u201cthe negotiated terms of the contracts are competitive with other agreements signed in countries at a similar resource development phase.\u201d A Tullow spokesman declined to comment. Repsol and Total did not respond to requests for comment.  Ali, a former housing minister, said it would be premature to say which parts of the other contracts need changing. But he said the contracts should make it easier for Guyanese companies to provide goods and services to oil explorers, arguing only foreign firms can handle lengthy payment delays.

ExxonMobil\/Handout via REUTERS  Here are five facts about one of the world\u2019s most remote and challenging liquefied natural gas (LNG) and condensate production and export facilities.  REMOTE LOCATION  The Papua New Guinea LNG (PNG LNG) project opened in 2014 in the South Pacific country, one of Asia\u2019s poorest and most politically troubled despite its resource wealth.  The main processing facility, the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant, sits in the rugged highlands of Hela Province and handles up to 1 billion cubic feet of gas daily from eight wells.  The site\u2019s remote location required chartering huge Russian Antonov cargo planes to deliver equipment to a jungle airfield at Komo, the longest airstrip in Papua New Guinea.  Hides is linked by a 700-km (435 miles) pipeline snaking through the jungle to the LNG plant and export terminal near the capital city Port Moresby.  (GRAPHIC: Papua New Guinea quake IMG, tmsnrt.rs\/2ow1YLR)  QUAKE DAMAGE  A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck near the Hides facility on Feb. 25, killing dozens of people and knocking out production. The quake damaged power infrastructure and the Komo airfield.  Before it can restart the facility, Exxon will inspect the pipeline and check the gas field for structural damage.  The export facility near Port Moresby, where the gas is liquefied for shipment on tankers, was not damaged, Exxon has said.  PRICE TAG  Exxon\u2019s main partners in the project are currently Australia\u2019s Oil Search and Santos.  In 2012, Exxon blamed unfavorable foreign exchange rates and delays caused by disgruntled workers and landowners for a $3.3 billion spike in costs, raising the price tag to $19 billion.  However, Exxon stunned markets when it completed the project in 2014, ahead of schedule and producing at up to 25 percent above its annual 6.9 million tonnes nameplate capacity.  TROUBLED PAST  Not all has gone smoothly for Exxon in Papua New Guinea.  In November 2017, the company evacuated some staff and suspended \u201cnon-essential work\u201d due to unrest in Hela Province. The violence was linked to national elections and disputes over royalties from the PNG LNG project.  In 2012, a landslide near a quarry used by Exxon killed at least 25 people and raised questions about the safety of excavations. Exxon said it had closed the quarry five months before the landslide.  BIGGER FUTURE  Only days before the Feb. 25 quake, Exxon said it had agreed to plans with French energy major Total to double capacity at PNG LNG at an estimated cost of $13 billion.  It was not clear if the quake had affected those plans.","159":"Nov 15 (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea is set to start talks with Exxon Mobil Corp to negotiate better terms for the state from the P\u2019Nyang Gas Project, Minister for Petroleum Kerenga Kua said on Friday.  \u201cAll things going well we can expect to sign a P\u2019Nyang Gas agreement around the end of this month,\u201d Kua said in a statement mailed to Reuters.

REUTERS\/Sergio Moraes  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil is the fossil fuel giant that is being attacked by a minnow. Newly formed activist fund Engine No. 1 has taken on the $176 billion oil major, demanding changes. The fund has only about a $40 million stake \u2013 or 0.02% to be precise. So Engine needs a few sharks in its corner. Given Exxon\u2019s record of destroying capital and ignoring shareholders, that shouldn\u2019t be hard.  Once the biggest American public company, the Texas-based oil driller is now well down the list. Over the past decade, it has spent $15 billion more on dividends and capital expenditure than cash generated by its business. The result has been a steadily growing debt load and steeply underperforming stock price. The share price has declined about 40% since the start of the year alone, and the company has underperformed rival oil majors over the past five years.  The firm recently begrudgingly acknowledged oil\u2019s difficulties. Next year\u2019s capital spending will fall to between $16 billion and $19 billion. But Chief Executive Darren Woods still says 2025 spending could surpass this year\u2019s roughly $23 billion. And shareholders pleas to consider a greener future hasn\u2019t been met with enthusiasm. Woods rarely joins earnings calls. An initiative passed by shareholders to produce a climate report has resulted in no substantive changes to its business.  Engine No. 1 has sensible recommendations. It wants Exxon to appoint new independent directors with outside energy experience, invest only in projects with lower break-even oil and gas prices, consider using existing skills and scale to invest in growing areas such as renewable energy, and change compensation policy that has resulted in Woods\u2019 pay increasing about 35% over the past two years, according to the activist.  Still Exxon may not be inclined to give in, so Engine has to enlist others. It already has the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System on board, which owns a $300 million stake in Exxon. But BlackRock could be next in line. The fund giant\u2019s boss Larry Fink has said that climate change is fundamentally altering investing, and the investment manager voted earlier this year to split Exxon\u2019s two top roles. That could be a big enough fish to fry Exxon.","163":"HOUSTON\/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N will exit some joint ventures with Russia's Rosneft ROSN.MM, citing Western sanctions first imposed in 2014, in a move that the Russian company said would result in serious losses for its U.S. partner.  A logo of Exxon Mobil is displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  Rosneft said it would welcome Exxon\u2019s return to the projects in the future if the \u201clegal possibility arises\u201d.  The decision is an about-face for Exxon, which had opposed the sanctions over Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea and argued they unfairly penalized U.S. companies while allowing foreign energy rivals to operate in the country, the world\u2019s largest oil producer.  The sanctions slowed work on a project by Exxon and Rosneft on what was hailed as a major discovery in the Kara Sea above the Arctic Circle.  Rosneft, Russia\u2019s largest oil company, said last year that it planned to return to operations at the project in 2019.  Exxon\u2019s exit will not affect the Sakhalin project off the eastern coast of Russia, Exxon and Rosneft spokesmen said.  Sakhalin-1 operates under a Production Sharing Agreement struck in the mid-1990s and currently produces around 200,000 barrels of oil per day.  Representatives for the U.S. Department of State and Treasury Department did not have immediate comment. The joint ventures were reached when U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was Exxon\u2019s chief executive.  Tillerson has taken a hard line on Russia as secretary of state, in contrast to his position while at Exxon. His tougher stance appears to be an effort to reassure U.S. allies and other friendly nations of Washington\u2019s backing amidst concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Tillerson has said U.S. sanctions imposed for Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea would remain in place until Crimea is returned to Ukraine. He has accused Moscow of imposing its will on other nations by force and employing disinformation and cyber attacks to subvert Western democracies.  The State Department said on Thursday Tillerson had recused himself from issues involving Exxon, and did not discuss the withdrawal with Exxon. A spokesperson would not comment on the company citing U.S. sanctions for the withdrawal.  \u2018SAKHALIN-1 J\/V NOT AFFECTED\u2019  Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontyev said Exxon had been forced to take what he called a predictable decision, but confirmed the move would not affect the Sakhalin-1 joint venture.  \u201cIt (Exxon) will suffer serious losses as a result of this (decision),\u201d said Leontyev.  Rosneft also said in a separate statement that it would continue with the projects without Exxon, and that work with Exxon on projects not subject to sanctions, as well as on future projects, would continue.  Exxon said it will formally start the process of withdrawing from the joint ventures this year.  In 2012, Exxon and Rosneft detailed an exploration partnership with plans to invest as much as $500 billion in developing Russia\u2019s Arctic and Black Sea oil reserves. Further deals were signed in 2014.  Rosneft said that resources at the projects, from which Exxon decided to withdraw, total 12.3 billion tonnes of oil and gas condensate as well as 15.2 trillion cubic meters of gas.  Exxon said in a financial filing on Wednesday that it recorded a fourth quarter after-tax loss of $200 million due to the withdrawal plan.  The U.S. government also imposed sanctions on Rosneft Chief Executive Igor Sechin in 2014.  The sanctions prohibit U.S. citizens or people in the United States from dealing with those on the blacklist, such as Sechin. Rosneft itself is subject to narrower U.S. sanctions that still allow Americans to deal with the company on some transactions.

Natural gas flares off at a production facility owned by Exxon near Carlsbad, New Mexico, U.S. February 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Nick Oxford  Workers at its Remuda lease near Carlsbad - part of a staff of 5,000 spread across New Mexico and Texas - are drilling wells, operating fleets of hydraulic pumps and digging trenches for pipelines.  The sprawling site reflects the massive commitment to the Permian Basin by oil majors, who have spent an estimated $10 billion buying acreage in the top U.S. shale field since the beginning of 2017, according to research firm Drillinginfo Inc.  The rising investment also reflects a recognition that Exxon, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc largely missed out on the first phase of the Permian shale bonanza while more nimble independent producers, who pioneered shale drilling technology, leased Permian acreage on the cheap.  Now that the field has made the U.S. the world\u2019s top oil producer, Exxon and other majors are moving aggressively to dominate the Permian and use the oil to feed their sprawling pipeline, trading, logistics, refining and chemicals businesses. The majors have 75 drilling rigs here this month, up from 31 in 2017, according to Drillinginfo. Exxon operates 48 of those rigs and plans to add seven more this year.  The majors\u2019 expansion comes as smaller independent producers, who profit only from selling the oil, are slowing exploration and cutting staff and budgets amid investor pressure to control spending and boost returns.  Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on March 6 that Exxon would change \u201cthe way that game is played\u201d in shale. Its size and businesses could allow Exxon to earn double-digit percentage returns in the Permian even if oil prices - now above $58 per barrel - crashed to below $35, added Senior Vice President Neil Chapman.  Exxon\u2019s 1.6 million acres in the Permian means it can approach the field as a \u201cmegaproject,\u201d said Staale Gjervik, the head of shale subsidiary XTO Resources, whose headquarters was recently relocated to share space with its logistics and refining businesses. The firm also recently outlined plans to nearly double the capacity of a Gulf Coast refinery to process shale oil.  \u201cIt sets us up to take a longer-term view,\u201d Gjervik said.  The majors\u2019 Permian investments position the field to compete with Saudi Arabia as the world\u2019s top oil-producing region and solidifies the United States as a powerhouse in global oil markets, said Daniel Yergin, an oil historian and vice chairman of consultancy IHS Markit.  \u201cA decade ago, capital investment was leaving the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s coming home in a very big way.\u201d  The Permian is expected to generate 5.4 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2023 - more than any single member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) other than Saudi Arabia, according to IHS Markit. Production this month, at about 4 million bpd, will about double that of two years ago.  Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP now hold about 4.5 million acres in the Permian Basin, according to Drillinginfo. Chevron and Exxon are poised to become the biggest producers in the field, leapfrogging independent producers such as Pioneer Natural Resources.  Pioneer recently dropped a pledge to hit 1 million bpd by 2026 amid pressure from investors to boost returns. It shifted its emphasis to generating cash flow and replaced its chief executive after posting fourth quarter profit that missed Wall Street earnings targets by 36 cents a share.  Shell, meanwhile, is considering a multi-billion dollar deal to purchase independent producer Endeavor Energy Resources, according to people familiar with the talks. Shell declined to comment and Endeavor did not respond to a request.  Slideshow ( 12 images )  Chevron said it would produce 900,000 bpd by 2023, while Exxon forecast pumping 1 million barrels per day by about 2024. That would give the two companies one-third of Permian production within five years.  SMALLER PRODUCERS GET SQUEEZED  At first, the rise of the Permian was driven largely by nimble explorers that pioneered new technology for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and horizontal drilling to unlock oil from shale rock, slashing production costs.  The advances by smaller companies initially left the majors behind. Now, those technologies are easily copied and widely available from service firms.  Surging Permian production has overwhelmed pipelines and forced producers to sell crude at a deep discount, sapping cash and profits of independents who, unlike the majors, don\u2019t own their own pipeline networks.  Even as the majors have ramped up operations, the total number of drilling rigs at work in the Permian has dropped to 464, from 493 in November, as independent producers have slowed production, according to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes.  Shell, by contrast, plans to keep expanding even if prices fall further, said Amir Gerges, Shell\u2019s Permian general manager.  \u201cWe have a bit more resilience\u201d than the independents, Gerges said.  In west Texas, the firm drills four to six wells at a time next to one another, a process called cube development that targets multiple layers of shale as deep as 8,000 feet.  Cube development is expensive and can take months, making it an option only for the majors and the largest independent producers. Shell has used the tactic to double production in two years, to 145,000 bpd.  The largest oil firms can also take advantage of their volume-buying power even if service companies raise prices for supplies or drilling and fracking crews, said Andrew Dittmar, a Drillinginfo analyst.  \u201cIt\u2019s like buying at Costco versus a neighborhood market,\u201d Dittmar said.  The majors\u2019 rush into the market means smaller companies are going to struggle to compete for service contracts and pay higher prices, said Roy Martin, analyst with energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re sitting across the negotiating table from the majors, the chips are stacked on their side,\u201d he said.  REBIRTH  The revival of interest in the Permian marks a reversal from the late 1990s, when production had been falling for two decades.  \u201cAll the majors and all the companies with names you\u2019ve heard left with their employees,\u201d said Karr Ingham, an oil and gas economist. \u201cConventional wisdom was this place was going to dry up.\u201d  Chevron was the only major that stayed in the Permian. It holds 2.3 million acres and owns most of its mineral rights, too, but until recently left drilling to others.  But this month, Chief Executive Mike Wirth called the Permian its best bet for delivering profits \u201cnorth of 30 percent at low oil prices.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can invest in that delivers higher rates of return,\u201d Wirth said this month at its annual investor meeting in New York.  \u2018HUNGER AND FEAR\u2019  Matt Gallagher, CEO of Parsley Energy Inc, calls the majors\u2019 investments \u201cthe best form of flattery\u201d for independents operating here.  Parsley holds 192,000 Permian acres - most of which was snatched up on the cheap during oil busts - and sees its smaller size as an advantage in shale.  \u201cWe\u2019re not finished yet,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cWe can move very quickly.\u201d  The majors have greater infrastructure, but independents continue to innovate and design better wells, said Allen Gilmer, a co-founder of Drillinginfo.  \u201cNothing is a bigger motivator than, \u2018Am I going to be alive tomorrow?\u2019\u201d Gilmer said. \u201cHunger and fear is something that every independent oil-and-gas person knows - and that something no major oil-and-gas person has ever felt in their career.\u201d","165":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is restarting the hydrocracker at its 560,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) Baytown, Texas, refinery on Tuesday, said sources familiar with plant operations.

The Feb. 15 blowout in Belmont County had spewed millions of cubic feet of gas into the air, triggering evacuations of nearby residences and raising concerns among environmental groups about health and environmental impacts.  Exposure to low levels of natural gas is not harmful to human health, according to the National Institutes of Health, but extremely high levels can cause loss of consciousness or death by displacing oxygen.  \u201cWe would like to press for a full accounting of the damage,\u201d said Melanie Houston, director of climate programs for the Ohio Environmental Council, an environmental advocacy group.  XTO spokeswoman Karen Matusic said the company could not immediately say how much gas leaked from the well, which was about to be put into production after being drilled and fracked.  An initial report from the Environmental Protection Agency on Feb. 17 estimated the natural gas flow rate from the well at 100 million cubic feet per day. Earthworks, an environmental group, compared the magnitude of the XTO well blowout with some of the biggest methane releases in the United States.  Matusic said the company has been taking air samples since the blowout and \u201cnever picked up anything that would harm humans or animals.\u201d  Following the well blowout, emergency responders evacuated about 30 homes within one mile of the well. Residents of all but four homes located within a half mile of the well were able to return home within a few days, Matusic said.  Ohio Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is the lead government agency at the XTO well pad. Officials at the DNR were not immediately available for comment  The U.S. EPA said it responded to a fire at the well on Feb. 15 to provide technical assistance and air monitoring at the site. Because there were no apparent release of oil or hazardous substances, the EPA said it demobilized on Feb. 21.  An unknown quantity of brine and produced water, estimated to be more than 5,000 gallons, was initially discharged to streams that flow into the Ohio River, according to the EPA.  Protected wildlife species located in proximity to or downstream from the well site are the Eastern Hellbender Salamander, Northern longeared bat, and protected fish.","171":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Monday it would take about eight weeks to restore production at the Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas project (LNG), following a powerful earthquake that hit the country\u2019s energy-rich interior a week ago.  The 7.5 magnitude quake on Feb. 26 triggered landslides and flattened buildings, killing at least 31 people, and has affected the regional LNG market. The South Pacific nation has declared a state of emergency.  Exxon said in a statement on Monday that 300 non-essential personnel had been evacuated and work at the Hides gas conditioning plant in the highlands had turned to restoring camp and associated facilities.  \u201cWhile the gas conditioning plant was safely shut in, there has been some damage to various pieces of equipment and foundation supports that will need to be inspected and repaired,\u201d it said.  \u201cInitial visual inspections of the major processing equipment indicate that they may not have been significantly impacted,\u201d it added.  Exxon is the operator and largest shareholder of the project that includes a 700-km (435-mile) gas pipeline that connects gas reserves in PNG\u2019s jungle Southern Highlands to a coastal liquefaction plant. Oil Search Ltd and Santos are also project partners.  Oil Search said the Agogo production facility and the Moran field were the most affected by the quake, and major repairs will be required before production can restart. The timeframe to restart production through Agogo is still being reviewed.  Uncertainty around production from PNG has drained liquidity from Asia\u2019s spot LNG markets with buyers and sellers taking a wait-and-see approach before committing to trade, a market source said.  The PNG LNG project is considered one of the world\u2019s best-performing LNG operations.

Exxon hired investment bank Jefferies to run the sale process, banking sources told Reuters last month.  Jefferies declined to comment.  In 2017, Exxon\u2019s net production from fields off Norway was around 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, according to its website.  The sale, if approved by regulators and completed, comes after Exxon focused in recent years on growing its onshore U.S. shale production, particularly in the Permian basin, as well as developing huge oil discoveries in Guyana.

Australia\u2019s Oil Search Ltd and Santos Ltd said they had been advised that one train at the LNG plant near Port Moresby has re-started operations and the second train is expected to resume as gas production ramps up.  LNG exports, which were expected to resume shortly, will come weeks ahead of schedule and may put pressure on spot LNG prices, traders said. Exxon Mobil Corp had earlier advised that production would restart in May 2018.  \u201cThe recommencement of operations at the PNG LNG Project, ahead of ExxonMobil\u2019s previously guided eight week timeframe, is a major achievement by the operator,\u201d said Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten.  Exxon Mobil was able to restart production earlier than expected because damage to hundreds of kilometers of pipelines that run through the mountains between gas output facilities and the LNG terminal was much less than initially feared, a source involved with the project told Reuters.  Santos is a foundation partner and holds a 13.5 percent interest in PNG LNG. Oil Search has a 29 percent stake.  Exxon Mobil declared force majeure on exports from PNG in March and the resulting uncertainty over supply drained liquidity from Asia\u2019s spot LNG markets, traders said.  \u201cAt the time the project was halted in late February, it was a time in the year when LNG prices were to gradually fall down as demand eases,\u201d said one industry source in Tokyo.  \u201cThe halt did have some impact in that it took longer for (Asian benchmark) prices to fall, but the impact was rather limited because demand was weak at the time,\u201d he said.  Asian spot LNG prices have lost almost 70 percent from their 2014 peak to around $7 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), driven lower by a global supply overhang that developed as new production came online, especially in Australia and the United States.  Worry about the surplus has been tempered somewhat by unexpectedly strong demand out of China, India and Southeast Asia, especially over this past winter.  Before the quake, the PNG LNG project had been producing at around 20 percent above its rated capacity of 6.9 million tonnes a year.  Another trader said that although the announcement would likely weigh on prices, any fall \u201cwill be limited by summer demand expected soon from Asia.\u201d","180":"(Adds Breakingviews link, updates share prices)  HOUSTON, April 27 (Reuters) - Weak refining margins hurt Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp\u2019s first-quarter profit, cutting into overall gains from rising oil prices.  It was the second consecutive quarter that refining weakness, especially outside the United States, clipped improved profit.  Strength in the Chevron division that pumps oil and gas helped overcome the refining weakness and beat Wall Street profit expectations for the quarter.  Exxon, though, has struggled in recent quarters to boost oil and gas output, and its overall first-quarterly results badly lagged expectations.  Shares of Exxon fell 3.7 percent to $77.88 in afternoon trading while Chevron rose 2.0 percent to $126.71. Exxon is off about 6.6 percent in the last two years while Chevron has soared 24.5 percent.  \u201cWhile the fourth quarter was a disaster for both, Chevron got back on track\u201d in the first quarter, said Brian Youngberg, an oil industry analyst at Edward Jones. \u201cExxon\u2019s still trying to get back on the road.\u201d  Both Exxon and Chevron have consistently touted the benefits of owning businesses that produce and refine oil, saying they better balance earnings as commodity prices rise and fall.  U.S. oil prices fell slightly to $67.98 per barrel.  Rising oil prices typically harm refiners by squeezing their margins on products, but they also boost profit at divisions that produce crude.  The strategy worked for Chevron during the quarter, helping the company top Wall Street expectations. At Exxon, weak refining results were coupled with lower oil production, fueling concern about Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods\u2019 turnaround plan for the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil producer.  Refining margins in Europe BRT-ROT-REF, for instance, fell more than 14 percent in the quarter and were on track for a 38 percent drop in the second period, the biggest quarterly decline since the fourth quarter of 2015.  Profit fell 12 percent in Exxon\u2019s downstream refining unit, and 14 percent in its chemical unit.  At Chevron, earnings in refining and chemical operations dropped 21 percent to $728 million.  Both companies have sought to bolster refining operations. Reuters reported earlier this month that they have asked U.S. regulators for exemptions to U.S. biofuels rules that are typically only given to small companies in financial distress.  \u2018NOT WHAT THE MARKET WANTS\u2019  Both companies said they are accelerating shale drilling in the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield, helping to lift the nation\u2019s output so far this year to more than 10 million barrels per day, a new record.

Some shareholders had rallied behind that proposal after Exxon was allowed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to remove a climate change proposal from its proxy ballot, but it won just 41 percent of the vote at the company\u2019s annual meeting in Dallas, Texas, on Wednesday.  The proposal would not have taken effect under Chief Executive Darren Woods, but would have been phased in for future CEOs.  Shareholders also voted against proposals that would have made it easier for shareholders to call special meetings; urged the board to create a special committee on climate change; report the risks of climate change at its U.S. Gulf Coast chemical plants; and report its political contributions and lobbying.  Exxon under Woods has moved aggressively to launch major expansion programs to find and produce new reserves of oil and natural gas, as well as expand the company\u2019s refining and chemical footprint.

A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Sergio Moraes  Exxon, together with partner Qatar Petroleum (QP), estimated in-place gas resources in the reservoir at 5 to 8 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas, similar order of magnitude to the Aphrodite and Calypso gas finds nearby, also in Cypriot waters.  The region\u2019s gas output has begun to soar thanks to older discoveries finally bearing fruit. Israel\u2019s Leviathan field, found in 2010 with around 22 tcf, will fully come online in November, though the 2015 Zohr discovery offshore Egypt with up to 30 tcf is already producing.  \u201cThis is the biggest find so far in Cyprus and based on some official data it is one of the biggest finds worldwide in the past two years,\u201d Cypriot Energy Minister Yiorgos Lakkotrypis said.  Exxon\u2019s Vice-President of Exploration for Europe, Russia and the Caspian, Tristan Aspray, said the company will now analyze data from drilling the reservoir, known as Glaucus-1. Exxon owns a 60 percent of the block, Block 10, with QP holding the rest.  Industry consultants Wood Mackenzie said they estimated recoverable resources of Exxon\u2019s field to be 4.55 trillion cubic feet. That compares to its 6.4 tcf estimate for Calypso, found by Italy\u2019s ENI and France\u2019s Total last year.  \u201cGlaucus is a giant.

It also provided a degree of energy security to Israel.  In Cyprus, development could be complicated by the internationally-recognized government\u2019s dispute with Turkey, which does not recognize its right to develop the resources.  Meanwhile, Cyprus\u2019 Aphrodite, which was first discovered in 2011, has been delayed as block stakeholders Noble Energy, Delek and Royal Dutch Shell renegotiate their production sharing agreement with the government.  A development concept for Aphrodite is also still being debated, with some now advocating that the gas be sent to Egypt to be liquefied and exported onwards on LNG tankers.  Morris said commercialization of the Exxon field was also \u201cnot straight forward\u201d.  \u201cThere is limited space in local markets and existing export infrastructure. And the volume is insufficient for ExxonMobil and its partner Qatar Petroleum to feed a two-train LNG plant \u2013 which had been the partnership\u2019s goal,\u201d he said.

The case in Manhattan state court, which kicked off last week, is the first of several lawsuits pending against major oil companies related to climate change to go to trial.  The lawsuit, brought by New York\u2019s attorney general, alleges that Exxon falsely told investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business using a \u201cproxy cost\u201d of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions, but internally used figures as low as $40 per ton or none at all.  It says Exxon caused investors to lose up to $1.6 billion.  Exxon has assailed the claims as false and politically motivated.  In his opening statement, Theodore Wells, a lawyer for the company, said that after Tillerson became chief executive in 2006, the company put in place a \u201crobust system\u201d to manage the risk of increasing climate change. Tillerson served as Exxon CEO from 2006 to 2017, and U.S. secretary of state under President Donald Trump from 2017 to 2018.  Wells said the $80 per ton proxy cost represented a \u201cglobal,\u201d \u201cmacro-level\u201d assessment of the cost, while lower figures, known as greenhouse gas or GHG costs, were used for particular capital projects depending on circumstances. He said Exxon never told investors the two numbers were the same.  Last Thursday, just two days after the New York trial began, Massachusetts filed a similar lawsuit accusing Exxon of misleading investors and consumers for decades about the role fossil fuels play in climate change.  Both Massachusetts and New York began investigating Exxon after news reports in 2015 saying that its own scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.  Those reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.  Exxon and other oil companies including BP Plc, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc face lawsuits by cities and counties across the United States seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels brought on by climate change.  The companies have said in court filings that they cannot be held liable for climate change.

Exxon Mobil Corp is placing big bets on China\u2019s soaring liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand, coupling multi-billion dollar production projects around the world with its first mainland storage and distribution outlet.  Its gas strategy is moving on two tracks: expanding output of the super-cooled gas in places such as Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, and creating demand for those supplies in China by opening Exxon\u2019s first import and storage hub, according to an Exxon manager and people briefed on the company\u2019s plans.  That combination \u201cwill guarantee us a steady outlet for lots of our LNG for decades,\u201d said the Exxon manager who was not authorized to discuss the project and spoke on condition of anonymity. One of the company\u2019s top policy goals this year, the manager said, is building its Chinese client roster.  \u201cChina\u2019s natural gas demand is rising really fast, with imports soaring well over 10 percent annually at the moment because of the government gasification program and due to fast rising industrial demand, including in petrochemicals,\u201d the Exxon manager said.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2CwGQgT  An Exxon spokesperson declined to provide an executive to discuss the company\u2019s LNG investments in China.  Years in the making, the strategy delivers an added benefit: helping Exxon sidestep a global trade war. Exxon\u2019s massive LNG projects in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique will not incur the 10 percent tariff China put on U.S. gas as part of the trade war between the Trump administration and Beijing.  Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at LNG tanker brokers Poten & Partners, which tracks LNG sales, said the deal provides \u201ca sign that China is willing to let foreign interests invest in things that in the past were seen as strategic.\u201d  Exxon is among the top ranked U.S. companies that are pushing ahead in China despite the trade dispute, but it is not alone. U.S. and European car makers are opening or expanding China plants to avoid hefty tariffs and transport costs. Tesla Inc this month acquired a Shanghai site for a car and battery-manufacturing complex.  Exxon\u2019s Asian and African LNG will offer a cost advantage over U.S. rivals\u2019 exports that face tariffs and greater transport, while China\u2019s support for the project offers a rebuttal to Trump administration complaints about the country\u2019s closed markets.  The decision to expand its LNG production and open an import terminal in the world\u2019s fastest growing LNG market is a step by Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods to pull the company out of an earnings rut that has left its shares flat over the past seven years.  TRADE WAR RISKS  Woods appeared holding discussions with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on state-run media last month days after disclosing local approvals for the LNG terminal and a massive chemical project in Guangdong province. Since becoming CEO last year, Woods has pushed Exxon to take greater risks, including in energy trading operations.  His timing with LNG is key. Next year, China will become the world\u2019s largest importer of natural gas, and its LNG imports are forecast to rise 70 percent by 2020, from 38.1 million tonnes last year, estimates Beijing consultancy SIA Energy.  Exxon has not publicly named its partner in the import terminal. State-run power company Guangdong Yuedian Group said on its website it will join the project. BP Plc is the only other foreign oil major with a stake in a Chinese LNG terminal.  Yuedian did not respond to a request for comment.  The multi-billion dollar bets still faces risks from the Sino-U.S. trade dispute. China has vowed to respond to any new tariffs by the Trump administration, which recently accused China of meddling in November elections and trying to recruit Americans to spy for it. But it remains unclear what that response will be and if it puts agreements like Exxon\u2019s in China in jeopardy.  In addition to the LNG terminal, Exxon received approval for its first wholly-owned chemical plant in China, becoming one of two foreign firms including Germany\u2019s BASF to gain approval to operate such plants without a local sponsor.  The terminal and chemicals plants combined will cost about $9 billion to build, consultancy IHS Markit estimates.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2wDdglt  CALL FOR NEW PROJECTS  China in 2017 embarked on a huge program to shift millions of households and factories from coal to natural gas for power and heating, a move to clear the smoggy skies over its cities.  That surge has injected new life into an LNG industry that suffered from plunging prices between 2014 and 2017, which forced energy companies to put off liquefaction projects.  But with prices for LNG rising this year, major producers have boosted investment. In addition to Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell PLC this month gave the go-ahead to a $31 billion LNG Canada project that will export fuel primarily to China.  \u201cMajor Independent Oil Companies such as Exxon aim for large-scale tier one positions, and in the LNG game that is Qatar, East Africa, and possibly some North American and Papua New Guinea projects,\u201d said Saul Kavonic, oil and gas researcher for Credit Suisse in Sydney, Australia.  Exxon and other LNG producers also are adapting to changing buyer behavior. In the past, LNG was dominated by long-term supply contracts - especially with Japanese and South Korean buyers - that could span several decades and in which buyer and seller agree to a fixed monthly volume at a set price formula, usually priced off crude oil.  That is changing, in part because China\u2019s importers either demand more contract flexibility or simply buy LNG at short-notice in the spot market whenever they need it.  The shift away from such rigid price-supply deals is forcing producers to trade new LNG supplies and give import terminals a larger role in encouraging spot purchases.  \u201cLNG players are increasingly adopting an LNG portfolio model whereby supply projects are not directly linked to end customers, with over 50 percent of contracts now coming from portfolio suppliers rather than specific projects,\u201d said Credit Suisse\u2019s Kavonic.","188":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018.

The reorganization will fold seven companies into three as of April 1, merging units for production, exploration, development, gas and power marketing, and others.  The new companies - ExxonMobil Upstream Oil & Gas Co, ExxonMobil Upstream Business Development Co and ExxonMobil Upstream Integrated Solutions Co - are designed to help the company double profits by 2025 and better coordinate oil and gas production with logistics and refining operations.  \u201cOur focus is on increasing overall value by strengthening our upstream business and further integrating it with the downstream and chemical segments,\u201d Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said in a statement.

The U.S. oil giant took charge of the East African LNG project\u2019s onshore operations following a $2.8 billion deal with Italy\u2019s Eni last year, adding to its suite of projects in Qatar, Papua New Guinea, Russia and the United States.  It now aims to build the world\u2019s biggest liquefaction units, or trains, outside Qatar, in Mozambique\u2019s remote north, shelving former operator Eni\u2019s more modest blueprint in pursuit of cost savings to boost returns on investment.  \u201cThe larger train design will lower the unit cost of the Rovuma LNG project and ensure a competitive new supply for the global LNG market,\u201d Exxon spokeswoman Julie King said in response to emailed questions.  Under new development plans submitted to the government this week, Exxon\u2019s first two liquefaction trains should each produce 7.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), with a start date in 2024.  Eni initially planned 5 mtpa trains.  The Italian oil major holds the offshore resource licence to Area 4, which contains some 85 trillion cubic feet of gas in place to be supercooled into a liquid and exported on ships to world markets.  Exxon\u2019s decision to super-size its first two trains meant it had to renegotiate a resource-sharing deal Eni struck in 2015 with rival LNG project developer Anadarko Petroleum, which owns the neighbouring Area 1 licence, industry sources said.  A geologically porous section of Area 4 covering the Mamba and Prosperidade fields straddles Area 1. This effectively means Exxon-Eni would pump gas away from Anadarko\u2019s adjoining reservoir to feed its LNG plant.  \u201cArea 4 and Area 1 stakeholders have agreed on the Unitization and Unit Operating Agreement which has been presented to the Mozambican government for approval,\u201d Exxon\u2019s King said.

But there the similarities end.  Anadarko Petroleum\u2019s approach involves raising a record $14-$15 billion from banks and export credit agencies (ECAs) to fund the build. At the same time, it is lining up long-term LNG sales deals with external companies in China, Asia and Europe to guarantee the loans.  Exxon in contrast will finance a larger share of costs from its own pockets as well as drawing on project partners, including Eni, Korea Gas Corp and China National Petroleum Corporation, bank and industry sources say.  Exxon said it expects Rovuma LNG financing to originate from a mix of \u201cexternal lenders and joint-venture party funding.\u201d  \u201cWe have begun initial engagement with lenders and are planning a formal kick-off event in September 2018,\u201d King said.  Anadarko engaged commercial banks on May 21 after having first secured interest for about $12 billion from ECAs.  Production from Rovuma LNG will also be treated differently.  While Anadarko sought out buyers from France\u2019s EDF to Britain\u2019s Centrica and Japan\u2019s Tokyo Gas, Exxon is holding talks for binding sales and purchase agreements for Rovuma output with subsidiaries of its Area 4 project partners.  \u201cWe expect sufficient interest from the affiliate buyers to launch the project and support the financing,\u201d King said.

The company has stakes in Gulf assets that produce the equivalent of more than 200,000 barrels of oil per day and 730 million cubic feet of gas daily, according to company data.  Exxon produces the equivalent of about 2.2 million barrels of oil daily. While Exxon is the most valuable publicly traded oil company, it is only the ninth-largest operator in the Gulf, trailing heavyweights like Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.AS and BP Plc BP.L, along with smaller Gulf-focused independent oil companies like Fieldwood and Talos.  The Gulf of Mexico, once considered a reliable basin for oil exploration and production, has become overshadowed by shale formations onshore and by new offshore plays like Guyana, where Exxon\u2019s giant Liza field is expected to produce 120,000 barrels per day of crude in its first phase.  \u201cExxon Mobil continually reviews its assets for their contribution toward meeting the company\u2019s operating needs, financial objectives and their potential value to others,\u201d a spokeswoman for Exxon said in a statement.  \u201cWe remain committed to conducting business in the U.S. Gulf region, as we have for more than 100 years.\u201d  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Exxon's positions in the Gulf of Mexico include a 50 percent stake in development of the large Julia oil field, and a 47 percent stake in the Hadrian South natural gas field, which it operates. The company also has a 9 percent piece of Heidelberg field and 23 percent of the Lucius oil and gas field, both of which are operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corp APC.N, according to Exxon's latest annual report.  Exxon\u2019s partners in developing many of these sites could have a contractual right of first refusal on any opportunity to acquire Exxon\u2019s interest, one of the sources said.  Exxon has sold 29 leases or stakes in leases to other companies since 2014, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.  The company has not acquired any leases from other companies in that period. In the last 10 federal lease sales of oil acreage, Exxon has bid on 28 leases, compared with rivals like BP, which has bid on 52 leases.  Exxon shares were up 0.7 percent to $86.42 each on Tuesday. Shares have risen 6.5 percent this year, trailing broader equity averages.  Qatar, which has a number of partnerships with Exxon, including in Brazil, would be well positioned to make an offer for the Gulf of Mexico assets, the sources said. Exxon has an extensive partnership with Qatar, including partnering with Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] to develop the world\u2019s largest non-associated natural gas field off that country\u2019s coast.  Qatar Petroleum also bought a 30 percent stake in two of Exxon\u2019s affiliates in Argentina in June, giving Qatar access to oil and gas shale assets in the Latin American country.  Qatar Petroleum\u2019s chief executive told Reuters in May that the company was expanding its upstream business and assets abroad, particularly in the United States.  Qatar Petroleum is the majority owner of the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas, with Exxon and ConocoPhillips holding smaller stakes.  It could not be established whether Qatar will indeed make an offer. Qatar government officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  This week, Chevron Corp agreed to sell its North Sea holdings off the shore of Britain.","197":"LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded ExxonMobil XOM.N to \"sell\" following disappointing fourth-quarter results, as the Wall Street bank forecasted the oil and gas company will meet only half of its targeted returns by 2025.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods described the margin weakness as \u201ca short-term impact\u201d.

Goldman said it saw \u201cclear downside\u201d to Exxon\u2019s target of reaching 15% ROCE by 2025, with its own modelling now showing 8% ROCE due to lower downstream margins, lower crude oil prices and risks to execution of projects.

FILE PHOTO: A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Sergio Moraes  Exxon paid a lower price to borrow than it did in a similar debt deal almost four weeks ago, a sign of how investor confidence is gradually returning after a rout in energy prices and a stock market collapse fueled by the coronavirus outbreak.  Nevertheless, borrowing costs for Exxon were still higher than prior to the coronavirus outbreak.  Exxon raised $9.5 billion by selling five different bonds with a variety of durations ranging from five years to 31 years, up from $9 billion which it had originally planned to raise, indicating robust investor demand.  In an example of how the company\u2019s borrowing costs have come down in recent weeks, it priced a 10.5-year bond worth $2 billion at a 185 basis-point premium to U.S. Treasuries with a 2.61% yield. On March 17, Exxon sold $2 billion in debt with a 10-year duration where the premium to U.S. Treasuries was 240 basis points and the yield was 3.482%.  In August last year, Exxon raised $1.25 billion through a 10-year bond with a premium to U.S. Treasuries of just 75 basis points and a yield of 2.44%.  The new issue by Exxon comes as highly rated U.S. companies have been tapping debt markets for cash at a record clip, stocking up on cash due to the uncertainty surrounding the economic impact from coronavirus.  The logic behind Exxon\u2019s deal was to stock up further on cash while the market is still open to issuers of new debt, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Exxon\u2019s stock has been hammered this year by the collapse in oil prices, with its share price down 38.7% so far in 2020, a steeper fall than the 14.5% drop in the benchmark S&P 500 Index.  In a regulatory filing, Exxon said it planned to use the proceeds for \u201cgeneral corporate purposes.\u201d  Oil prices were mixed on Monday, as the historic production-cut deal signed by major global oil producers was not enough to assuage existing worries about the demand destruction brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.

The questions came from New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who last year led a campaign that convinced a majority of Exxon shareholders to call on the company to detail risks it could face from rising global temperatures.  Exxon produced a report in February outlining how global oil demand could drop sharply by 2040, but critics said the report fell short on areas like how climate policies could affect company finances.  Exxon has tried to placate investors by other means. At its annual investor day last month in New York, for instance, Exxon for the first time dedicated more than two hours to renewable technology investments and climate change.  In a letter to Exxon, shown to Reuters, DiNapoli\u2019s co-director of corporate governance Patrick Doherty called on Exxon to cut greenhouse gas emissions and sought details such as how its projections for fuel demand compare to national policy goals, or if Exxon considers health-based emissions standards in projections for fuel demand.  In the letter Doherty wrote that his office needs answers for a \u201cfull understanding of Exxon Mobil\u2019s planning and preparation to operate in a carbon constrained economy and in a changing climate.\u201d  Asked about DiNapoli\u2019s letter, Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said via e-mail that \u201cWe value input from all of our shareholders.\u201d  Separately, DiNapoli\u2019s office said on Tuesday it asked other companies including energy firms and utilities to reduce emissions and to address climate change risks. But staff withdrew resolutions at several U.S. energy firms after they agreed to provide climate risk details including at DTE Energy Co and at Dominion Energy Inc.  Exxon\u2019s annual proxy filing, likely to be released this month, will include ballot items for investors ahead of the company\u2019s shareholder meeting set for May 30 in Dallas.  A New York State fund overseen by DiNapoli, which has about 11.5 million shares of Exxon, withdrew a climate resolution for this year\u2019s proxy ahead of Exxon\u2019s February report.  In theory investors left unhappy by the time of Exxon\u2019s meeting could vote against individual company directors, though so far major investors who backed DiNapoli\u2019s proposal last year have declined to discuss their views.","202":"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)  EDDY COUNTY, NEW MEXICO, March 20 (Reuters) - In New Mexico\u2019s Chihuahuan Desert, Exxon Mobil Corp is building a massive shale oil project that its executives boast will allow it to ride out the industry\u2019s notorious boom-and-bust cycles.  Workers at its Remuda lease near Carlsbad - part of a staff of 5,000 spread across New Mexico and Texas - are drilling wells, operating fleets of hydraulic pumps and digging trenches for pipelines.  The sprawling site reflects the massive commitment to the Permian Basin by oil majors, who have spent an estimated $10 billion buying acreage in the top U.S. shale field since the beginning of 2017, according to research firm Drillinginfo Inc.  The rising investment also reflects a recognition that Exxon, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc largely missed out on the first phase of the Permian shale bonanza while more nimble independent producers, who pioneered shale drilling technology, leased Permian acreage on the cheap.  Now that the field has made the U.S. the world\u2019s top oil producer, Exxon and other majors are moving aggressively to dominate the Permian and use the oil to feed their sprawling pipeline, trading, logistics, refining and chemicals businesses. The majors have 75 drilling rigs here this month, up from 31 in 2017, according to Drillinginfo. Exxon operates 48 of those rigs and plans to add seven more this year.  The majors\u2019 expansion comes as smaller independent producers, who profit only from selling the oil, are slowing exploration and cutting staff and budgets amid investor pressure to control spending and boost returns.  Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on March 6 that Exxon would change \u201cthe way that game is played\u201d in shale. Its size and businesses could allow Exxon to earn double-digit percentage returns in the Permian even if oil prices - now above $58 per barrel - crashed to below $35, added Senior Vice President Neil Chapman.  Exxon\u2019s 1.6 million acres in the Permian means it can approach the field as a \u201cmegaproject,\u201d said Staale Gjervik, the head of shale subsidiary XTO Resources, whose headquarters was recently relocated to share space with its logistics and refining businesses. The firm also recently outlined plans to nearly double the capacity of a Gulf Coast refinery to process shale oil.  \u201cIt sets us up to take a longer-term view,\u201d Gjervik said.  The majors\u2019 Permian investments position the field to compete with Saudi Arabia as the world\u2019s top oil-producing region and solidifies the United States as a powerhouse in global oil markets, said Daniel Yergin, an oil historian and vice chairman of consultancy IHS Markit.  \u201cA decade ago, capital investment was leaving the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s coming home in a very big way.\u201d  The Permian is expected to generate 5.4 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2023 - more than any single member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) other than Saudi Arabia, according to IHS Markit. Production this month, at about 4 million bpd, will about double that of two years ago.  Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP now hold about 4.5 million acres in the Permian Basin, according to Drillinginfo. Chevron and Exxon are poised to become the biggest producers in the field, leapfrogging independent producers such as Pioneer Natural Resources.  Pioneer recently dropped a pledge to hit 1 million bpd by 2026 amid pressure from investors to boost returns. It shifted its emphasis to generating cash flow and replaced its chief executive after posting fourth quarter profit that missed Wall Street earnings targets by 36 cents a share.  Shell, meanwhile, is considering a multi-billion dollar deal to purchase independent producer Endeavor Energy Resources, according to people familiar with the talks. Shell declined to comment and Endeavor did not respond to a request.  Chevron said it would produce 900,000 bpd by 2023, while Exxon forecast pumping 1 million barrels per day by about 2024. That would give the two companies one-third of Permian production within five years.  SMALLER PRODUCERS GET SQUEEZED  At first, the rise of the Permian was driven largely by nimble explorers that pioneered new technology for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and horizontal drilling to unlock oil from shale rock, slashing production costs.  The advances by smaller companies initially left the majors behind. Now, those technologies are easily copied and widely available from service firms.  Surging Permian production has overwhelmed pipelines and forced producers to sell crude at a deep discount, sapping cash and profits of independents who, unlike the majors, don\u2019t own their own pipeline networks.  Even as the majors have ramped up operations, the total number of drilling rigs at work in the Permian has dropped to 464, from 493 in November, as independent producers have slowed production, according to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes .  Shell, by contrast, plans to keep expanding even if prices fall further, said Amir Gerges, Shell\u2019s Permian general manager.  \u201cWe have a bit more resilience\u201d than the independents, Gerges said.  In west Texas, the firm drills four to six wells at a time next to one another, a process called cube development that targets multiple layers of shale as deep as 8,000 feet.  Cube development is expensive and can take months, making it an option only for the majors and the largest independent producers. Shell has used the tactic to double production in two years, to 145,000 bpd.  The largest oil firms can also take advantage of their volume-buying power even if service companies raise prices for supplies or drilling and fracking crews, said Andrew Dittmar, a Drillinginfo analyst.  \u201cIt\u2019s like buying at Costco versus a neighborhood market,\u201d Dittmar said.  The majors\u2019 rush into the market means smaller companies are going to struggle to compete for service contracts and pay higher prices, said Roy Martin, analyst with energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re sitting across the negotiating table from the majors, the chips are stacked on their side,\u201d he said.  REBIRTH  The revival of interest in the Permian marks a reversal from the late 1990s, when production had been falling for two decades.  \u201cAll the majors and all the companies with names you\u2019ve heard left with their employees,\u201d said Karr Ingham, an oil and gas economist. \u201cConventional wisdom was this place was going to dry up.\u201d  Chevron was the only major that stayed in the Permian. It holds 2.3 million acres and owns most of its mineral rights, too, but until recently left drilling to others.  But this month, Chief Executive Mike Wirth called the Permian its best bet for delivering profits \u201cnorth of 30 percent at low oil prices.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can invest in that delivers higher rates of return,\u201d Wirth said this month at its annual investor meeting in New York.  \u2018HUNGER AND FEAR\u2019  Matt Gallagher, CEO of Parsley Energy Inc, calls the majors\u2019 investments \u201cthe best form of flattery\u201d for independents operating here.  Parsley holds 192,000 Permian acres - most of which was snatched up on the cheap during oil busts - and sees its smaller size as an advantage in shale.  \u201cWe\u2019re not finished yet,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cWe can move very quickly.\u201d  The majors have greater infrastructure, but independents continue to innovate and design better wells, said Allen Gilmer, a co-founder of Drillinginfo.  \u201cNothing is a bigger motivator than, \u2018Am I going to be alive tomorrow?\u2019\u201d Gilmer said. \u201cHunger and fear is something that every independent oil-and-gas person knows - and that something no major oil-and-gas person has ever felt in their career.\u201d","203":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for New York state and Exxon Mobil Corp delivered closing arguments in a closely watched trial accusing the oil company of hiding from investors the true cost of addressing climate change.  Theodore Wells, the lawyer for Exxon, exits New York State Supreme Court in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., November 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The case, filed in October 2018 in Manhattan state court, was the first of several climate-related lawsuits against major oil companies to go to trial.  It featured testimony from investors, experts and former Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, who denied the allegations against the company.  New York\u2019s attorney general alleges that Exxon caused investors to lose up to $1.6 billion by falsely telling them it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business. A verdict is expected within the next 40 days.  Exxon\u2019s lawyer said on Thursday the case was \u201cmeritless\u201d and that the state failed to offer testimony from any investor who was misled.  \u201cThe case is almost a joke,\u201d Theodore Wells said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a cruel joke, your honor, because the reputations of a lot of people have been hurt and disparaged by the bringing of the complaint.\u201d  A lawyer for the state said the case came down to whether Exxon had adequately disclosed the cost of climate change.  \u201cThe question here isn\u2019t whether Exxon employees are good people or even were trying their best,\u201d Jonathan Zweig said.  He told the court that the state was dropping two of its four fraud claims and would limit its closing argument to claims brought under the Martin Act, a law that gives the New York attorney general\u2019s office broad power to pursue securities fraud cases without having to prove intent to defraud.  \u201cThe question in this case is whether Exxon\u2019s disclosures were accurate, and the evidence shows they were not,\u201d Zweig said.  The attorney general has said the company used a \u201cproxy cost\u201d of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions in wealthy countries by 2040, but internally used figures as low as $40 per ton or none at all.  Tillerson testified that the proxy cost represented \u201cmacro level\u201d assessment of the likely effect of future carbon regulations around the world on demand for fossil fuels, and was incorporated into a data guide used throughout Exxon.  Separately, he said, the company evaluated greenhouse gas costs at a \u201cmicro level\u201d for specific projects, when appropriate.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Wells said the attorney general\u2019s case wrongly conflated proxy costs with those separate, project-specific costs.  Last month, just two days after the New York trial began, Massachusetts filed a similar lawsuit accusing Exxon of misleading investors and consumers for decades about the role fossil fuels play in climate change.  Both Massachusetts and New York began investigating Exxon after news reports in 2015 saying company scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.  Exxon and other oil companies including BP Plc, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc face lawsuits by cities and counties across the United States seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels brought on by climate change.  The companies have said in court filings that they cannot be held liable for climate change.","204":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N on Friday reported a $1.1 billion second-quarter loss on sharply lower energy demand and prices from the COVID-19 pandemic, and confirmed plans to make deeper spending cuts.  It was Exxon\u2019s first back-to-back quarterly loss in at least 36 years, but was small in comparison to rivals who took giant charges last quarter. The top U.S. oil producer took no asset write-downs during the quarter, and got a 44-cent-a-share boost to earnings by increasing the value of inventories.  Chevron Corp CVX.N, Total TOTF.PA, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, and Eni ENI.MI each wrote down their oil and gas properties last quarter by several billion dollars apiece, while BP BP.L signaled an up to $17.5 billion hit.  Exxon slashed capital spending 30% this year to around $23 billion, and Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said it expects to spend less than $19 billion in next year. That would be the lowest spending for the company since at least 2005.  It plans both capital and operating expense cuts to defend its dividend, Chapman said on a call with analysts, adding that investors \u201ccome to view that dividend as a source of stability in their income.\u201d  It will not take on more debt and sees spending cuts as short term \u201cto manage the current situation,\u201d Chapman said.  Prior to the pandemic, Chief Executive Darren Woods pursued an ambitious spending plan to boost oil output and turn around sagging profits on a bet that a growing global middle class would demand more of its products.

Exxon has identified an \u201cundertaking a comprehensive evaluation,\u201d of its global businesses, it said, without providing details.  Exxon\u2019s oil and gas production business fell to a loss and its refining unit was hit by lower demand and weaker prices.  The U.S. oil major reported a loss of $1.08 billion, or 26 cents per share, compared with a profit of $3.13 billion, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding inventory adjustments, the loss would have been $3 billion, it said.  On that adjusted basis, its per share loss of 70 cents missed Wall Street\u2019s estimate of 61 cents, according to data from Refinitiv.  Exxon\u2019s oil and gas output fell 7% to 3.6 million barrels per day during the quarter as it curtailed production due to the oil price crash.  Rival Chevron on Friday reported an $8.3 billion loss on asset writedowns, plummeting fuel prices, and expenses tied to thousands of jobs cuts.  Exxon\u2019s production business reported a nearly $1.7 billion loss on lower output prices, compared with a $3.3 billion gain last year. Refining generated a $976 million operating profit despite lower margins and volumes. The unit\u2019s gain came from an about $3.5 billion boost from non-cash inventory revaluations and by reversing a prior quarter\u2019s impairment.  Chemical operating profit was $467 million, up from $188 million last year, and was \u201cresilient\u201d in a tough environment, said analyst Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited.  The company is running out of capacity to add debt \u201cwithout jeopardizing the strength of its balance sheet,\u201d said analyst Jennifer Rowland of Edward Jones.

An Exxon spokesman said the company has supported climate research in conjunction with governments and academic institutions for nearly 40 years, with a \u201ccommitment to helping address this important societal challenge.\u201d  \u201cExxonMobil has continuously and publicly researched and discussed the risks of climate change, carbon life-cycle analysis and emissions reductions,\u201d Exxon\u2019s Scott Silvestri said.  Warren, one of 17 Democrats vying to take on President Donald Trump in November 2020, has made anti-corruption efforts a centerpiece of her White House bid.  The Massachusetts senator has previously detailed how she would crack down on the so-called revolving door in Washington between the government and lobbying firms, mandate that elected officials release their tax returns and beef up government ethics rules.  In her plan released Tuesday, Warren also said she would ban agencies and courts from considering industry-funded research that has not been peer reviewed.  Warren noted in the early 2000s, Exxon paid nearly a third of the annual budget of the group Frontiers of Freedom, which promoted industry-friendly research minimizing climate change risks. Tobacco companies such as Phillip Morris MO.N and RJ Reynolds also provided the limited-government group with financial support.  \u201cMy plan would require industry actors who submit non-peer-reviewed research to agencies to disclose how that research was funded, whether those funders influenced the research\u2019s findings, and the nature of any past or ongoing financial relationships,\u201d Warren wrote.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan cited public policy and due process considerations in deciding not to enforce the October 2011 award against Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC), which was subsequently set aside by courts in Nigeria.  \u201cWhile this court may have inherent authority to fashion appropriate relief in certain circumstances, exercising that authority to create a $1.8 billion judgment is a bridge too far,\u201d Pauley wrote in a 50-page decision.

According to court papers, the 1993 contract anticipated that Exxon and Shell affiliates would invest billions of dollars to extract oil from the Erha field, about 60 miles (97 km) off Nigeria\u2019s coast, and share profits with NNPC.  But the affiliates, Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Co Ltd, accused NNPC of unilaterally \u201clifting\u201d more oil than was contractually allowed, at the behest of Nigeria\u2019s government, depriving them of billions of dollars of oil.

Payara\u2019s startup had been slated for \u201cas early as 2023\u201d and was expected to eventually produce some 220,000 barrels per day of crude, according to Exxon\u2019s website.  The firm and its partners Hess Corp HES.N and China's CNOOC Ltd 0883.HK have discovered more than 8 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the South American country, which has no history of production.  The Exxon-led consortium in January produced some 56,320 bpd of crude at Phase 1 of its Liza project. Phase 2 of the same venture, at the prolific Stabroek block, is the next project expected to bring production online.  The company said on Tuesday current operations at Liza were unaffected by a 30% cut in planned capital spending this year as the coronavirus pandemic saps energy demand and oil prices. Startup of the second phase of Liza also remains on track for 2022.  But at neighboring Payara, where Exxon and partners are still awaiting approval from the government to send a third vessel needed to start offshore production, some activities planned for this year are being deferred, Exxon said, potentially delaying its startup by 6-12 months.  Guyana is an integral part of Exxon\u2019s growth plans, Chief Executive Darren Woods said.  The company\u2019s shares were up 3.9% at $42.06 in afternoon trading on Tuesday as investors cheered the spending cuts.

Pattern wages refers to the national pattern agreement reached in January 2019 between the USW International and U.S. refiners that sets wage increases for all USW-represented workers.  Under the proposal rejected in January, pay was set to go up 3.5% in the first year and 4% in the second year. In the third year, the increase would match the pay hike in the new national agreement the USW will negotiate for oil industry workers with energy companies in January 2022.  Brooks said the company has suggested the pay proposals would be less if the two sides go back to the bargaining table.  Negotiations for a new contract to replace the current pact that expires on May 15 began in December with a company-proposed three-year extension that was rejected in January by workers in the 560,500 barrel-per-day refinery and the complex\u2019s laboratory.

The attorney general sued Exxon in October 2018 under the Martin Act, a New York state law that had been used primarily to go after financial fraud.  The lawsuit claimed Exxon falsely told investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business using a \u201cproxy cost\u201d for the likely effects of future events on its business.  However, these proxy figures frequently were not used in its internal planning or cost assumptions, according to the lawsuit.  The attorney general also accused the company of failing to account properly for the costs of potential regulation in determining the value of its oil and gas reserves, or whether to write down the value of its assets.  Massachusetts is separately investigating whether Exxon concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels play in climate change.  Both Massachusetts and New York began investigating Exxon after news reports in 2015 saying its own scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.  Those reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.

The contribution, made to the Americans for Carbon Dividends political action committee of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), was disclosed by the group on Tuesday, less than a month after Exxon agreed to contribute $100 million to oil companies\u2019 efforts to develop technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Company spokesman Scott Silvestri referred questions on the lobbying contribution to the CLC.  Exxon, the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil company, has supported a carbon tax in the past and has stepped up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in its operations. Those efforts came amid lawsuits brought by U.S. city and state officials seeking damages to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels that result from global warming.  The Climate Leadership Council\u2019s PAC aims to spend $5 million on an initial lobbying campaign to win support for the tax, said Greg Bertelsen, senior vice president at the group.  \u201cWe\u2019re in the very early days of this organization,\u201d said Bertelsen, who said the PAC is looking to build legislative support for its carbon tax. It proposes an initial $40 a ton tax on carbon dioxide that would increase over time, with the money raised to be returned to consumers.  The PAC, led by former U.S. Senators John Breaux and Trent Lott, also has raised $1 million each from Exelon Corp, First Solar Inc and the American Wind Energy Association, he said. It expects to reach its goal of a $5 million in coming months, he said.  The council\u2019s proposal was developed by former Secretaries of State James Baker and George Schultz.

REUTERS\/Sergio Moraes  A consortium including both companies and a unit of China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd have so far discovered more than 6 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas resources off Guyana\u2019s coast, which could eventually produce 750,000 barrels per day (bpd) for a country that has no history of crude output.  Those finds are turning Guyana, an impoverished nation bordering longtime producers Venezuela and Brazil, into a hot property for oil investment.  Exxon\u2019s Guyana spokeswoman last week told Reuters that \u201ckey activities\u201d on its giant Stabroek block, including early production, were running ahead of schedule. He said that coming weeks would be critical as progress could be impacted by weather and other factors.  The U.S. company did not provide additional details. Hess declined to comment. CNOOC and Guyana\u2019s government were not immediately available for comment.  Liza will be the first Guyanese crude grade produced and offered to the oil market. It has 32 API degrees of density and 0.5 percent of sulfur content, according to Exxon\u2019s assay seen by Reuters.  Exxon is planning on shipping two 1-million-barrel cargoes of Liza crude in January, to be followed by similarly sized shipments from Hess and Guyana\u2019s government in February.  Exxon plans to process the oil at its refineries, while Hess could offer it for spot sales. CNOOC, which has not yet scheduled exports, would ship it to China, whose refiners like using similar medium sweet grades, the sources said.  Interested buyers are exploring options to co-load Liza crude with other South American crudes bound for Asia, mainly Brazilian grades. Starting in March, very large crude carriers (VLCCs) could lift up to 2 million barrels each, depending on weather conditions, the sources added.  \u201cWe are expecting Liza to be traded at $4-$6 over Brent crude prices during the first three months of exports. First buyers would test it, and then prices could go up a little,\u201d a trader interested in purchases said.  The Liza project is expected to produce up to 120,000 bpd of oil in 2020-2022 and reach 750,000 bpd by 2025. Exxon had initially planned first production to come in early 2020, but in November it said it could be available in December.

REUTERS\/Nerijus Adomaitis  Tanzanian President John Magufuli has asked his government to proceed with negotiations to set out the commercial and fiscal framework for the LNG project, Equinor, a majority state-owned energy company formerly known as Statoil, said.  \u201cEquinor will now proceed with our partner ExxonMobil with negotiations for a host government agreement,\u201d an Equinor spokesman said in an email to Reuters.  He said it was too early to say how long talks with the government could take and how much the project would cost.  Tanzania said in 2014 that a planned LNG export plant could cost up to $30 billion.  Royal Dutch Shell, which operates deepwater Blocks 1 and 4, adjacent to Equinor\u2019s Block 2, previously sought to develop the LNG project in partnership with Equinor and Exxon Mobil.  \u201cShell continues to work with the government of Tanzania to establish the most cost effective and competitive solution for the LNG project in Tanzania,\u201d a company spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters.  \u201cWe believe the government is best placed to lead the right way forward to deliver the project,\u201d she added.  Shell declined to say whether it would join Equinor and Exxon Mobil or would pursue separate talks with the government.  Shell said on its website the three blocks had sufficient gas reserves to build an onshore LNG plant, but the company was not immediately available to comment on whether it would join the other two in starting talks.  Shell estimates its two blocks hold about 16 trillion cubic feet (453 billion cubic meters) of recoverable gas, similar to the volumes in Equinor\u2019s Block 2.  Reuters reported in June that Exxon Mobil was seeking to sell its 25 percent stake in Block 2 as it was focusing on an even bigger project in neighboring Mozambique.","238":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday they are investing in a $10 billion project to expand a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Texas, as companies race to meet global demand for the fuel.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Construction of the Golden Pass LNG project in Sabine Pass, Texas, is expected to begin early this year. The project will add production capacity of around 16 million tonnes of LNG per year after it starts up in 2024.  Reuters had first reported details of the deal on Feb. 1, based on sources familiar with the matter.  \u201cGolden Pass will provide an increased, reliable, long-term supply of liquefied natural gas to global gas markets, stimulate local growth and create thousands of jobs,\u201d Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said of the final investment decision.  Woods and Qatar Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad al-Kaabi signed the deal at the Four Seasons hotel in Washington in the presence of U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  The deal is proof that two of the world\u2019s top energy producers can work together and \u201csupport rather than subvert an open energy marketplace,\u201d Perry said.  The Trump administration has promoted gas drilling and LNG exports in part to offer European customers alternatives to piped natural gas from Russia, while slashing Obama-era environmental regulations on energy operations.  \u201cTo understand how critical this is, imagine how Europe feels when the winter winds begin to blow and Russia has its hand on the pipe valve,\u201d Perry said. Russia has in recent years slashed gas shipments to Europe through Ukraine during pricing disputes.  Worldwide consumption of LNG is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, triggering a race among oil and gas companies eager to dominate the market.  Exxon has a 30 percent stake in Golden Pass and Qatar Petroleum holds 70 percent. The two have been strengthening a global alliance across LNG projects from the United States to Mozambique.  Exxon has signed an agreement to buy a 12.4 percent interest in the existing terminal and a pipeline from ConocoPhillips, and the purchase is subject to regulatory approvals, both companies said.  The expansion is part of Qatar Petroleum\u2019s plans to invest about $20 billion in the United States as the company seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas business.  Qatar, a tiny but wealthy country, is one of the most influential players in the LNG market with annual production of 77 million tonnes. It plans to boost capacity 43 percent by 2023-24.  Qatar left the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year, allowing it to expand in the United States without concerns about proposed legislation that could limit OPEC members\u2019 investments in the country.  Energy industry construction firm McDermott International Inc and its partners, Chiyoda International Corp and Zachry Group, have won a contract worth more than $1 billion to build the export project, McDermott said separately on Tuesday.  The Golden Pass project is one of many that could be approved this year. Companies are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year.","239":"Nov 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp\u2019s third-quarter profit nearly halved, mainly hit by lower oil prices and weakness in its chemicals business.

REUTERS\/Ernest Scheyder  The development is a sea change for a company that has stood out from rivals by limiting its past activity out of concern it would be accused of market manipulation. Exxon now aims to trade around more of its growing energy assets to get the best prices for its products and increase earnings, according to an employee familiar with the matter.  Expanded trading could add hundreds of millions of dollars to annual earnings from its own buying and selling of crude and fuels, but also comes with problems, including higher risk. Exxon XOM.N expects to add 1 million barrels per day of output over the next several years as new oilfields and refinery expansions kick in, giving it more assets to trade.  Exxon last year retained John Masek, a former trader at Swiss-based Glencore GLEN.L, the world's second largest buyer and seller of petroleum, to consult on gasoline trading. Earlier this year, it poached four gasoline market specialists from refiner Phillips 66 PSX.N.  This month, Exxon hired former BHP Billiton Plc BLT.L trader Nelson Lee as an international crude trader, the people familiar with the matter said. In 2014, Lee orchestrated BHP's first-ever crude exports by maintaining the lightly refined oil met criteria for an exportable product. The deals helped usher in the end to a U.S. prohibition on crude exports more than a year later.  The company has also added crude, products and liquefied natural gas specialists to London and Singapore offices. It recently hired Paul Butcher, a trader who has worked at BP Plc BP.L, Glencore and Vitol, to advise on North Sea markets and accounting for trading transactions.  \u201cPaul is known for being a very aggressive, old school crude trader. Exxon would have never hired a risk taker of that scale in the old days. The fact that he is consulting them shows they are considering changes in trading very seriously,\u201d said a trading house executive who knows Butcher.  Phillips 66 declined to comment on the employee departures.  Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri referred questions about its trading business and recent hiring to regulatory filings, which note the historical use of financial derivatives and geographic scale to manage commodity price risks.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  LIMITED RISK  Chief Executive Darren Woods wants to increase Exxon\u2019s profit and appetite for risk at a measured pace, according to people who deal with Exxon. The U.S. operation runs from a trading floor at its Spring, Texas campus that has expanded to as many as 70 workers who will handle everything from Canadian crude to gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.  \u201cTrading has been a virtual four-letter word at Exxon,\u201d said Ehud Ronn, a University of Texas finance professor who studies energy and financial risk management. Exxon has drawn most top managers from engineering backgrounds, not financial services. \u201cA change in their trading policy would indeed be transformational.\u201d  Exxon has long lagged behind rivals BP Plc BP.L, Chevron Corp CVX.N and Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L, which have created trading units that occasionally generate more profit than their refining businesses.  During the oil price downturn of 2015-2016, companies like Shell RDSa.L often made more profit in refining than in oil production, also known as upstream, and often cited trading as contributing to the success of the refining division.  Shell for example trades more than 8 million barrels per day or 8 percent of global production, twice the size of its own or Exxon\u2019s output. The huge figures come partially thanks to trading barrels of third parties, which Exxon currently does on a very limited scale.  Exxon would also normally hedge only cargoes going from one region to another and where crude is priced according to different benchmarks. BP and Shell would normally hedge all cargoes as well as taking sometimes a pure speculative position on the paper market to make profit, according to traders working for the firms.  \u201cExxon still doesn\u2019t plan to begin speculative paper trading,\u201d said one source familiar with Exxon\u2019s thinking.  Woods faces pressure from Exxon investors to lift shares that trade at the same price as 10 years ago. He promised shareholders this year that he can double profit and increase its oil and gas output by 25 percent by 2025.  The company\u2019s expanded focus on trading brings challenges including added risk from options, swaps and other derivatives, and developing risk-management and compensation systems for the larger business.  Exxon has held talks with at least two developers of risk-management software, Enuit LLC and Allegro Development Corp, people familiar with the discussions said. Both offer packages that manage logistics and measure financial exposure. The companies declined to comment on their discussions with Exxon, according to spokespeople.  Exxon has also put company veteran managers in charge of overall trading and risk controls at its Spring, Texas, floor, one person familiar with its operations said, to avoid potential losses as it expands trading.  \u201cWe\u2019ve heard whispers in the market about this for a few years, so it\u2019s great to see them finally hiring commercial talent externally,\u201d said an executive recruiter familiar with some of the recent hires but who was not directly involved.","241":"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania\u2019s lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved on Wednesday a much-awaited offshore hydrocarbons legal framework, needed before energy groups OMV Petrom and Exxon decide whether to pursue further investment in the Black Sea.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Alberto was transitioning to a tropical cyclone as its circulation became more focused around a central core located 135 miles (220 km) west of Tampa, Florida, with 50 mile per hour winds (85 kph).  The storm was expected to make landfall on Monday morning in the Florida panhandle.  Chevron shut production at its Blind Faith and Petronius platforms in the eastern Gulf. The Blind Faith platform is located in the Mississippi Canyon region of the northern Gulf of Mexico.  The Petronius platform is in the Viosca Knoll area of the Gulf.

Colgan also said U.S. companies would face \u201ca host of practical challenges\u201d to operate in Syria.  Even getting Exxon or another major oil company to develop Syrian oil would be a \u201chard sell\u201d given its relatively limited infrastructure and small output, said Ellen R. Wald, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global Energy Center.  Syria produced around 380,000 barrels of oil per day before the country\u2019s civil war erupted. An International Monetary Fund working paper in 2016 estimated that production had declined to just 40,000 barrels per day.  Still, the United States should be concerned about the fate of the Syrian oil fields, said Alex Cranberg, chairman of energy firm Aspect Holdings LLC, which has explored production in Iraqi Kurdistan but no longer has active projects in the region.  \u201cIt\u2019s not that the oil itself matters much to the U.S., but that its misuse could fund future problems for us\u201d if it falls into the wrong hands, Cranberg said, noting his company has not been approached by the White House.  \u201cU.S. control over the disposition of the fields and the hard currency they offer would provide a significant influence over the shape of Syria\u2019s future,\u201d he said.  Robert O\u2019Brien, a U.S. National Security advisor to the president, said a U.S. military presence will be required to protect the Syrian oilfields, suggesting it also should have a say on their proceeds.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to be there for a period of time to maintain control of those and make sure that there is not a resurgence of ISIS and make sure that the Kurds have some revenue from those oil fields,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, speaking to NBC News\u2019 Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.","249":"Dec 14 (Reuters) - Oil major Exxon Mobil Corp said on Monday it planned to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions over the next five years to support the goals of the Paris Agreement.

State-owned Romgaz would then be interested in holding a 20% stake in the Neptun Deep project, Chief Executive Adrian Volintiru said.  Exxon confirmed in January it was weighing an exit from the Neptun Deep project. The other half of the project is owned by Romania\u2019s OMV Petrom, which is majority-controlled by Austria\u2019s OMV.  \u201cWe have the appetite to acquire 20% of Neptun Deep should Exxon decide to sell,\u201d Volintiru told an energy seminar organised by financial daily Ziarul Financiar, and said Romgaz had signed a joint binding agreement with OMV Petrom and PGNiG to partner in buying Exxon\u2019s stake.  Romania\u2019s economy minister said on Monday he was confident Romgaz would be part of a consortium to buy Exxon\u2019s stake.  Romgaz also holds a 12.2% stake in a separate offshore joint venture in the Black Sea led by Russia\u2019s Lukoil.  Several gas producers have spent a decade and billions of dollars preparing to tap Romania\u2019s Black Sea gas, but they were blindsided by price caps, taxes and export restrictions pushed forward by a previous centre-left government.  Romania\u2019s current Liberal minority government is running the European Union country on an interim basis after it lost a no confidence vote earlier this month. Prior to the no confidence vote, it had begun undoing some of the legal and tax changes that had raised concerns with investors.  Whereas Neptun Deep is still awaiting an investment decision pending legal changes, another Black Sea oil project, Black Sea Oil & Gas (BSOG), controlled by private equity firm Carlyle Group LP, has been almost finalised. It could start producing roughly 1 billion cubic metres of gas per year in 2021 with some delays, BSOG told the same seminar.  \u201cIt\u2019s vital to us that by the time we start producing first gas these things (tax and legal changes) will be resolved,\u201d BSOG chief executive Mark Beacom told the conference. \u201cWe have two years to get this sorted.\u201d  Meanwhile, Romgaz\u2019s Volintiru said the company was also hopeful about new onshore gas discoveries. In 2017, Romgaz announced its biggest find in three decades in the Caragele field, in the central Romanian county of Buzau, with an estimated 25-27 billion cubic metres of gas.  \u201cWe have hopes that somewhere in Bucovina in eastern Romania there could be a very large field, comparable to Caragele, but we need to do some more digging to confirm,\u201d Volintiru said.

Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), which has $1.5 trillion under management and owns about 0.5% of Exxon or shares worth about $1 billion, said the U.S. company had not disclosed its full greenhouse gas emissions and had failed to set company-wide emissions reduction targets.  U.S. majors lag European rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell or BP in making climate-related commitments.  A group of investors representing $19 trillion sees Shell and Eni taking a lead among oil majors on climate issues but says even their targets fall short of goals needed to hit targets in the 2015 Paris climate deal.  \u201cWe remain concerned by the Exxon\u2019s lack of strategic ambition around climate change,\u201d said Meryam Omi, LGIM Head of Sustainability and Responsible Investment Strategy.  She said LGIM would vote against re-electing Darren Woods as chair of the company at the shareholders\u2019 meeting on May 27. Woods is also the company\u2019s chief executive.  Exxon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  Reflecting its concerns, LGIM divested Exxon shares last year from its Future World Funds, which focuses on environment, social and governance performance.  \u201cWe are seeing many of Exxon\u2019s peers step up, and reaffirm their sustainability ambitions even amid the current testing circumstances. The world, and Exxon\u2019s investors, cannot afford the company to fall behind,\u201d Omi said.  LGIM is also opposed companies combining the role of chief executive and chair, a practice followed at Exxon and many other U.S. companies.  \u201cWe believe that the separation of combined CEO and board chair roles provides a better balance of authority and responsibility,\u201d Omi said.  \u201cIn addition, if companies spend investors\u2019 money on lobbying governments, we expect them to account for how and why they do this,\u201d she added.

REUTERS\/Loren Elliott\/File Photo\/File Photo  The sale process, initially planned for late last year, is expected to raise less than originally expected after a 40% drop in oil prices since January and their weakened long-term outlook.  The top U.S. oil company has in recent weeks held talks with a number of potential North Sea buyers to gauge interest in the portfolio, four sources with direct knowledge of the discussions said on condition of anonymity.  Exxon is unlikely to officially launch the sale process if it finds there is insufficient interest, the sources said.  Exxon declined to comment.  \u201cAs a matter of practice, ExxonMobil does not comment on market rumours or speculation about our business plans,\u201d Exxon spokeswoman Julie King said.  Most of Exxon's British operations are managed through Esso Exploration and Production UK, a 50-50 joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, and include interests in nearly 40 oil and gas fields.  The JV, one of the industry\u2019s oldest, has been producing gas since 1968 and oil since 1976.  The portfolio\u2019s value, however, is unclear.  Initially, Irving, Texas-headquartered Exxon hoped to raise over $2 billion from the sale, according to the sources.  They said $1 to $1.5 billion was more likely now given the oil market\u2019s weakness.  A spokeswoman for investment bank Jefferies, which is running the sale process, declined to comment.  With many of the assets approaching the end of their lives, their value will depend largely on how the buyer and Exxon agree to manage the costs of plugging wells and removing unused platforms, a process known as decommissioning.  Potential buyers could include large private equity-backed North Sea producers such as Chrysaor and NEO Exploration & Production. HitecVision, which owns NEO, and Chrysaor declined to comment.  Exxon produces around 80,000 barrels of oil and 441 million cubic feet of gas a day in the British North Sea, roughly 5% of Britain\u2019s daily demand, its website says.

LNG is seen helping the German government diversify away from pipeline gas arriving from Russia, Norway and the Netherlands.  Suppliers, most notably Qatar and the United States, have expressed interest.  The Wilhelmshaven FSRU is expected to have a send-out capacity of 10 billion cubic metres per year and will be Germany\u2019s first LNG terminal. It is expected to begin operating in the second half of 2022.  Uniper and ExxonMobil will continue their discussions over the coming months to seek binding agreements, Uniper said.  Wilhelmshaven is a deep-sea port close to storage facilities and pipelines.  In December, Uniper said it had entered into agreements with Japanese shipping group Mitsui OSK Lines to own, operate and fund the FSRU.  Uniper has always stressed its role will be a facilitator, handling the marketing of the volumes, developing the FSRU into a multi-user facility and finding more buyers keen on booking capacity.  Longer term, it could use the capacity partly to optimise sales of LNG volumes it will be drawing from Freeport in the United States from second half of this year, where it has separately started global marketing efforts.  Uniper said it will press on with receiving operations permits from the relevant authorities for Wilhelmshaven.  In January, it struck a deal with Dutch firm Titan LNG to add logistics services at Wilhelmshaven.  FSRUs are cheaper and quicker to build than on-shore terminals. Germany has three LNG terminal projects.  Some observers are puzzled by the interest as many LNG terminals in the EU suffer from underutilisation, but concede new facilities will support further diversification as the market expands.

New York state\u2019s pension fund, Church Commissioners for England, and Legal & General Investment Management, which all battled Exxon over global warming and lobbying disclosures have this year taken up a call to split the chief executive officer and chairman roles, expecting a better reception from an outsider.  \u201cThe company has been a laggard on financial performance, climate risk management and lobbying disclosure for quite some time now,\u201d said Thomas DiNapoli, New York state comptroller and head of the state\u2019s biggest pension fund. \u201cIts peers in Europe, many of whom have independent board chairs, are outperforming Exxon on all these,\u201d he said.  California Public Employees Retirement System, which holds 9.6 million Exxon shares, just behind New York\u2019s 10.2 million shares, last week came out in favor of splitting the two roles. Proxy adviser Glass, Lewis & Co separately called for splitting the two roles.  On Tuesday, Institutional Shareholder Services urged holders to vote \u201cagainst\u201d creating an independent chairman, reversing its stance from a year ago. Exxon\u2019s naming of a lead director able to meet with shareholders changed its view, ISS wrote.  Still, Exxon management is under scrutiny after reporting the first loss in three decades. Under Chairman and CEO Darren Woods, Exxon spent heavily in the last three years for new oil and natural gas supplies, a move that has so far backfired as prices collapsed.  Exxon\u2019s broad rejection of climate proposals, challenging sponsors and rebuffing proposals as micromanaging or unneeded, has accelerated under Woods. This year, Exxon challenged and blocked six climate resolution from appearing at its May 27 shareholder meeting.  Rivals Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Repsol SA and BP Plc meantime adopted proposals to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.  Climate measures elsewhere are gaining. Three climate proposals this year have won majority votes, including at oil firms\u2019 Phillips 66 and Ovintiv Inc. While not all results from the 15 are in yet, last year none received a majority, according to data compiled by the Sustainable Investments Institute.  Activists are smarting from a 2017 vote. That year, 62% of shareholders approved a measure led by New York state and calling for Exxon to disclose business impacts from complying with climate policies. After agreeing not to pursue the topic the following year, New York officials were disappointed by the resulting report.  An Exxon spokesman declined to comment, pointing to rebuttals that note it has increased the lead director\u2019s power. Combining the chairman and CEO roles \u201censures items of greatest importance for the business\u201d are quickly brought to the board, Exxon told shareholders in urging a vote against the measure. It also pointed to $10 billion in lower-emissions investments it has made over a decade.  The proposal for an independent board chairman would not take effect under Woods, but would be phased in for future CEOs.  As at other big companies, shareholder support for an independent chairman has never gotten far at Exxon. Last year, 40.7% of Exxon shareholders supported the measure, up from 38.7% in 2018. A measure calling for the company to report on its lobbying activities also failed.  But both were \u201cwithin striking distance of getting a majority,\u201d said Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at the Church Commissioners for England. Exxon\u2019s rejection of climate proposals \u201cis in stark contrast to all of its supermajor peers,\u201d he said.","263":"(Recasts, adds details)  TOKYO, Feb 27 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp will shut the Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant for at least seven days for inspection for any damage to the facility after an earthquake, said an industry source familiar with the matter who declined to be identified.

Warren said companies and executives could face criminal liability for false information they knowingly provide to U.S. agencies, leading to up to $250,000 in fines or jail time.  \u201cNo one would be liable for mistakes, for submitting research in good faith that turns out to be wrong, or for raising honest disagreements,\u201d Warren wrote on the website Medium.  \u201cBut where companies engage in egregious and intentional efforts to mislead agencies in an effort to prevent our government from understanding and acting on facts, they will face criminal liability,\u201d she added.  Warren, one of 17 Democrats vying to take on President Donald Trump in November 2020, has made anti-corruption efforts a centerpiece of her White House bid.  The Massachusetts senator has previously detailed how she would crack down on the so-called revolving door in Washington between the government and lobbying firms, mandate that elected officials release their tax returns and beef up government ethics rules.  In her plan released Tuesday, Warren also said she would ban agencies and courts from considering industry-funded research that has not been peer reviewed and establish a public advocate office to allow greater participation in the rule-making process within U.S. agencies.  Warren noted in the early 2000s, Exxon paid nearly a third of the annual budget of the group Frontiers of Freedom, which promoted industry-friendly research minimizing climate change risks. Tobacco companies such as Phillip Morris and RJ Reynolds also provided the limited-government group with financial support.  \u201cMy plan would require industry actors who submit non-peer-reviewed research to agencies to disclose how that research was funded, whether those funders influenced the research\u2019s findings, and the nature of any past or ongoing financial relationships between the researchers and their corporate backers,\u201d Warren wrote.  Warren cited recent congressional testimony by a former Exxon consultant that the company knew of serious risks posed by climate change in the early 1980s. In 2009, a group of industry groups that included Exxon filed a regulatory comment with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that stated the effects of climate change were \u201calmost non-existent and engulfed in an extremely high degree of uncertainty.\u201d  Rex Tillerson, Exxon\u2019s chief executive from 2006 to 2017, served as Trump\u2019s secretary of state from February 2017 to March 2018.

Graphic: reut.rs\/2tq3zY6  A company declares a force majeure when it is unable to fulfill a contract because of forces beyond its control.  While some buyers reportedly bought LNG spot cargoes at around $10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in the immediate wake of the Papua outage to meet short-term demand, multiple traders this week said overall LNG market conditions were easing due to the onset of the low demand spring season across the Northern Hemisphere.  Asia spot LNG prices were around $8.50 per mmBtu on Friday, down from $8.80 the previous week.  Weather data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows temperatures in Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul - three core demand centers for LNG in North Asia - to rise to around double their seasonal norms within the next two weeks, implying a sharp drop-off in gas demand for heating.  Graphic: reut.rs\/2DbOqtn  In Europe, where a spat of extreme cold caused prices to spike to records last week, temperatures have also returned to seasonal norms and are expected to rise further in the coming weeks as winter ends.  Although LNG markets are expected to ease during the upcoming low demand spring in the Northern Hemisphere, Katie Bays, an energy analyst at U.S. Height Securities, said in a note that markets were overall getting tighter, due to structural demand increases, especially in China, where a government gasification program is moving millions of households and factories from coal to gas.  Graphic: reut.rs\/2FoeiYW  \u201cThough prices have come in, they remain around $8.50\/mmBtu, supported by outages in Papua New Guinea... and by a sudden cold snap in Northwest Europe, which sent UK gas prices soaring (last week),\u201d Bays said.  China\u2019s natural gas imports surged by more than a quarter last year and it overtook South Korea as the world\u2019s second-biggest importer of LNG. Only Japan buys more, although most analysts expect China to pass Japan in the coming years as well.  Since China has significant domestic gas production, and also has large pipelines feeding it from Central Asia, its utilities only scale up LNG purchases in the spot market when their demand cannot be met otherwise, especially during peak demand in the winter.  \u201cThe market will see a very tight winter next year with little new capacity set to come online,\u201d Bays said.  Low demand lulls during spring and tight winters triggering a wave of Chinese buying will likely result in \u201cgreater price volatility,\u201d she added.","269":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two years into an ambitious growth plan to revive earnings at the largest U.S. oil company, Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N said on Thursday it would stick to its plans to \"lean in\" to spending even as its shares have lagged those of competitors, which are cutting costs.  FILE PHOTO: Darren Woods, Chairman & CEO of Exxon Mobil Corporation attends a news conference at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 1, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Oil prices have fallen more than 20% this year, natural gas is at its lowest price since the 1990s and the industry\u2019s long-term outlook is clouded by a push toward cleaner fuels. The entire oil industry has fallen out of favor with investors, but Exxon, once the industry\u2019s cash flow and profit leader, has tumbled particularly hard.  The company is \u201cmindful of the current market environment,\u201d but will stay with its strategy of \u201cleaning in to this market when others have pulled back,\u201d Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said at the company\u2019s annual investor day meeting. He first laid out plans to improve profit through investment in 2018, and Thursday\u2019s message did not diverge from that.  The industry faces a drop in demand for its products this year as the coronavirus spreads globally, but \u201cthe longer term horizon is more clear,\u201d Woods said, arguing that improving living standards mean the world will need more oil.  But Exxon's total share return is minus 26% over the last five years, far behind the other global oil majors, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, while the broader S&P 500 Index .SPX has returned 49%.  The company plans to spend between $30 billion and $35 billion a year through 2025. Spending will rise from $31 billion last year to about $33 billion this year, though Woods said that number could dip if the company needs to adjust for market conditions or if costs come in lower.  Exxon is \u201cplaying the long game,\u201d said Anish Kapadia of Palissy Advisors, hoping that its peers\u2019 underinvestment means commodity prices will rise and it will profit.  \u201cHowever, this is not a strategy that investors are going to buy in to today as they are more focused on where commodity prices are at currently,\u201d Kapadia said, adding, \u201cThere is a fear in the market that global demand for hydrocarbons will stagnate or fall\u201d given investor focus on climate.  Investors, including the world\u2019s top asset manager BlackRock, have warned company boards to step up efforts to tackle climate change.  Exxon is \u201cpursuing a strategy that is destructive of both shareholder value and the planet,\u201d said Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England who co-leads climate talks with Exxon and attended Thursday\u2019s meeting.  Some European oil companies have set ambitious climate goals, but Woods said Exxon was focused on reducing its own emissions and would not engage in a \u201cbeauty match\u201d with its peers.  Exxon is likely \u201cin for another tough year,\u201d said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst with RBC Europe Limited. With weak oil and gas prices and muted refining margins, Exxon will \u201cbarely\u201d cover its capital spending with free cash flow and its dividend coverage will be \u201cthe worst\u201d among the major oil companies, he said.  Its growth plans include a big bet on U.S. shale, where output has surged, making the United States the world\u2019s largest oil producer, and on Guyana, where an Exxon-led consortium has made one of the biggest discoveries in years.  In the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, Exxon has been expanding production rapidly and expects to produce around 360,000 barrels per day this year. It slightly slowed its aggressive pace, the first such move by an oil major in the field as smaller companies slash budgets and lay down equipment.  Exxon has 58 drilling rigs at work now, but said it will drop that number by 20% this year as it picks up drilling speed.  It is racing its closest U.S. rival, Chevron Corp CVX.N, to reach 1 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day there, and Exxon said it still will surpass that target by 2024.  On Tuesday, Chevron said it had up to $80 billion in its war chest that it could use for shareholder returns over the next five years, regardless of oil prices.","270":"FILE PHOTO: Logos of ExxonMobil are seen in its booth at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan April 4, 2017.

State television news channel TVM on Sunday said the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy would host a signing ceremony with Exxon and other firms in the capital Maputo on Tuesday.  Exxon has said it expects 17,000 tons of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) per year during the production phase, with the signing of an initial investment decision paving the way for the massive infrastructure project to begin.  The gas fields are located off the coast of the northern Cabo Delgado province, which for the last two years has seen intensifying attacks on surrounding communities and government buildings by an extreme Islamist militant group.  In February Texas-based petroleum firm Anadarko said one worker was killed and several others injured in two related attacks in the Cabo Delgado area where it is building a 17,000-acre liquefaction complex.","271":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Chevron Corp CVX.N, two of the world's largest oil producers, reported quarterly profit on Friday that fell far short of Wall Street's expectations.

Exxon\u2019s troubles highlight ongoing issues the company has been having to boost operations, whereas Chevron\u2019s miss was fueled by a slight rise in expenses that likely will not be repeated, analysts said.  Exxon shares fell 2.5 percent to $82.09 shortly after midday, while Chevron's recovered from an early drop and were up about 2 percent at $126.34. Both stocks are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI.

Iraqi oil officials say Exxon evacuated all of its foreign staff from the West Qurna 1 field on Friday and Saturday, about 60 people. The U.S. oil major has a long term contract to improve the field.  Its evacuation came days after Washington sent non-essential staff home from the U.S. embassy in Baghdad over what it said was a security alert caused by threats from Iran, which has close ties to Shi\u2019ite militia groups operating in Iraq.  The United States is ramping up sanctions pressure on Iran, especially over oil exports. Iraq relies heavily on natural gas from Iran for its electricity supply, which is stretched during hot summer months.  Ghadhban said there were a number of ways Iraq could compensate in case Iranian gas supplies were reduced, including using gas oil stores in some power plants, but so far there had been no change in supplies.  Ghadhban separately said Iraq has almost 5 million barrels per day of oil capacity, with a current surplus capacity of around 400,000 bpd  \u201cWe are [producing] around 4.5 mln bpd, which is our production rate that we agreed to in December last year,\u201d he said.","273":"LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil XOM.N is seeking buyers for its stake in a large undeveloped gas field off Tanzania, according to three banking and industry sources, as the company focuses on the development of an even bigger project in neighboring Mozambique.

Woods, who became CEO in January 2017 after predecessor Rex Tillerson retired and became U.S. secretary of state, has come under heavy pressure from investors over the past year to turn around the world\u2019s largest publicly-traded oil and gas company as its output and earnings sagged.  Exxon holds a 35 percent stake in Tanzania's deepwater Block 2 field that was discovered earlier this decade. It holds an estimated 23 trillion cubic feet of gas, according to the website of Norway's Equinor EQNR.OL, which operates the block and holds a 65 percent stake.  The prospect has faced repeated delays in recent years due mainly to a lack of infrastructure and regulation for the country\u2019s nascent oil and gas sector, complicating any sale. The sources said the value of the asset was unclear due to early stage of development and uncertain future.  Exxon declined to comment.  A spokesman for Equinor declined to comment on the sale process. He said the company had not changed its plans in Tanzania.  Tanzania has moved down the priority list for Exxon after it acquired a 25 percent stake in the gas-rich Area 4 development offshore Mozambique $2.8 billion from Eni ENI.MI last year.  Area 4, holding an estimated 85 trillion cubic feet of gas, is one of the world\u2019s largest gas discoveries in recent years, and far bigger than the Tanzanian field. The project is also far more advanced - it is already under development and expected to start production in 2022.

Follow This, a Dutch organisation that spearheaded a number of climate shareholder resolutions at Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s AGMs over the past three years said it also filed one with the Anglo-Dutch company for 2019.  It also plans to file a resolution with U.S. rivals Exxon Mobil and Chevron \u201cunless other parties file a similar resolution,\u201d it said in a statement.  The 2019 resolution calls on the companies to set and publish targets for the reduction of carbon emissions in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Accords to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.  The targets should include emissions from the drilling and refining operations as well as for the burning of fuels and products such as plastics which are sold to millions of customers around the world, known as Scope 3 emissions.  BP CEO Bob Dudley has repeatedly opposed setting targets for Scope 3 emission reduction.  It calls on the companies to set clear metrics to measure greenhouse gas emissions and disclose information on progress.  \u201cTargets should be on the agenda of every oil company, given that the oil industry can make or break the Paris Climate Agreement,\u201d said Follow This founder Mark van Baal.

A Shell spokeswoman said the Follow This resolution was \u201cunnecessary\u201d after the company last week announced plans to set sector-leading emission targets that will be linked to executive pay and include Scope 3 emissions.  The announcement, which followed extensive discussions with investors, marked a reversal for Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden who had previously opposed setting targets.  \u201cWe are planning short-term targets for the net carbon footprint of our energy products.

Shell\u2019s board has consistently opposed the Follow This resolutions which were voted down with less than 6.34 percent of the vote since 2015.  In the 2018 AGM, the discussion around the resolution however led to a heated debate between van Beurden and van Baal.

The company, which is one of the four long-term buyers of gas from the Papua LNG project, procuring 1.5 million tonnes per year, expects some impact to vessel scheduling from the outage, but so far there has not been enough of an impact to require buying replacement cargoes, Osaka Gas President Takehiro Honjo told reporters.

Honjo said that ExxonMobil has informed it that the project\u2019s facilities have been halted safely and he repeated the eight week timetable for a restart. He added that the company has been weighing the situation carefully.  The impact of the shutdown to the company is limited as it has a range of options, such as using buying more volumes from another project or arranging with other buyers that procure LNG from the same project to change LNG shipping arrangements, an industry source familiar with the matter said.  The impact of the shutdown on Osaka Gas was also limited since not all of its annual procurement volumes from Papua LNG are imported to its facilities in Japan because the project offers some flexibility on allowing cargoes to be resold, said the source.","279":"(Adds comment from Guyana government, updates share price)  April 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday that production at the Payara project, its third development in Guyana, could be postponed due to delays in government approvals as the company scales back spending elsewhere due to the crude price crash.  Payara\u2019s startup had been slated for \u201cas early as 2023\u201d and was expected to eventually produce some 220,000 barrels per day of crude, according to Exxon\u2019s website.  The firm and its partners Hess Corp and China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd have discovered more than 8 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the South American country, which has no history of production.  The Exxon-led consortium in January produced some 56,320 bpd of crude at Phase 1 of its Liza project. Phase 2 of the same venture, at the prolific Stabroek block, is the next project expected to bring production online.  The company said on Tuesday current operations at Liza were unaffected by a 30% cut in planned capital spending this year as the coronavirus pandemic saps energy demand and oil prices. Startup of the second phase of Liza also remains on track for 2022.  But at neighboring Payara, where Exxon and partners are still awaiting approval from the government to send a third vessel needed to start offshore production, some activities planned for this year are being deferred, Exxon said, potentially delaying its startup by 6-12 months.  Guyana is an integral part of Exxon\u2019s growth plans, Chief Executive Darren Woods said.

The world\u2019s top oil and gas companies are under heavy pressure from investors and climate activists to meet the 2015 Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels.  Exxon and U.S. rival Chevron Corp have been far less ambitious with their greenhouse gas reduction targets than their European rivals.  BP Plc in February set one of the oil sector\u2019s most ambitious targets for curbing carbon emissions, including getting emissions from its operations and barrels produced to net zero.  Exxon will hold its annual investor meeting on Thursday and is expected to detail its climate goals.  Exxon started its methane reduction program in 2017 in its shale fields and has been able to reduce emissions by 20%.

The region is emerging as a new hot spot for gas exploration and production.  Until those discoveries, Israel was believed to be sitting on scant oil and gas reserves. There was little reason for energy firms to explore for energy in Israel and risk complicating operations and future investments in nearby Arab countries that hold some of the world\u2019s largest energy reserves.  Exxon executives held talks with Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz in Houston this week about bidding for the right to explore and pump oil from offshore blocks in an auction that Israel will hold in June, said the person with direct knowledge.  Exxon, the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil company, recently acquired a $50,000 data package from the Israeli energy ministry for the auction, the person said.  An Exxon team also visited a data center set up by the ministry in Jerusalem, the source said.

Exxon declined comment. Israel\u2019s energy ministry declined comment.  In February, Exxon announced a major gas discovery in Cyprus together with its partner Qatar Petroleum. That field is near two other huge gas finds in the region: Leviathan off Israel and Zohr off Egypt.  The U.S. major and competitors such as Royal Dutch Shell and France\u2019s Total have avoided investing in Israel, for fear of souring relationships with the governments of giant regional oil and gas producers such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq. Those countries do not recognize Israel.  Exxon is one of the biggest foreign investors in Qatar. It also has refining and petrochemical operations in Saudi Arabia, and produces oil and gas in Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.  President Donald Trump has angered the Arab world and stoked international concern with changes to U.S. policy in the region, including moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.

Israel hopes that the coming licensing round will draw significantly larger interest than a previous round when only two companies bid amid skepticism about its ability to sell and export the fuel.  Israel has signed major export deals with Jordan and Egypt over the past two years, opening new markets to companies looking to sell Israeli gas. Egypt also saw rapid growth in natural gas production following the discovery of giant fields in the Mediterranean.  Several other major oil and gas companies are considering bidding in the licensing round, which closes June 17, according to the source.","283":"AMSTERDAM, June 25 (Reuters) - Energy companies Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil will not submit a claim for missed revenue due to the Dutch government\u2019s decision to halt gas production at the Groningen field by 2030, the Dutch ministry of Economic Affairs said on Monday.

Exxon Mobil Corp is placing big bets on China\u2019s soaring liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand, coupling multi-billion dollar production projects around the world with its first mainland storage and distribution outlet.  Its gas strategy is moving on two tracks: expanding output of the super-cooled gas in places such as Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, and creating demand for those supplies in China by opening Exxon\u2019s first import and storage hub, according to an Exxon manager and people briefed on the company\u2019s plans.  That combination \u201cwill guarantee us a steady outlet for lots of our LNG for decades,\u201d said the Exxon manager who was not authorized to discuss the project and spoke on condition of anonymity. One of the company\u2019s top policy goals this year, the manager said, is building its Chinese client roster.  \u201cChina\u2019s natural gas demand is rising really fast, with imports soaring well over 10 percent annually at the moment because of the government gasification program and due to fast rising industrial demand, including in petrochemicals,\u201d the Exxon manager said.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2CwGQgT  An Exxon spokesperson declined to provide an executive to discuss the company\u2019s LNG investments in China.  Years in the making, the strategy delivers an added benefit: helping Exxon sidestep a global trade war. Exxon\u2019s massive LNG projects in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique will not incur the 10 percent tariff China put on U.S. gas as part of the trade war between the Trump administration and Beijing.  Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at LNG tanker brokers Poten & Partners, which tracks LNG sales, said the deal provides \u201ca sign that China is willing to let foreign interests invest in things that in the past were seen as strategic.\u201d  Exxon is among the top ranked U.S. companies that are pushing ahead in China despite the trade dispute, but it is not alone. U.S. and European car makers are opening or expanding China plants to avoid hefty tariffs and transport costs. Tesla Inc this month acquired a Shanghai site for a car and battery-manufacturing complex.  Exxon\u2019s Asian and African LNG will offer a cost advantage over U.S. rivals\u2019 exports that face tariffs and greater transport, while China\u2019s support for the project offers a rebuttal to Trump administration complaints about the country\u2019s closed markets.  The decision to expand its LNG production and open an import terminal in the world\u2019s fastest growing LNG market is a step by Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods to pull the company out of an earnings rut that has left its shares flat over the past seven years.  TRADE WAR RISKS  Woods appeared holding discussions with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on state-run media last month days after disclosing local approvals for the LNG terminal and a massive chemical project in Guangdong province. Since becoming CEO last year, Woods has pushed Exxon to take greater risks, including in energy trading operations.  His timing with LNG is key. Next year, China will become the world\u2019s largest importer of natural gas, and its LNG imports are forecast to rise 70 percent by 2020, from 38.1 million tonnes last year, estimates Beijing consultancy SIA Energy.  Exxon has not publicly named its partner in the import terminal. State-run power company Guangdong Yuedian Group said on its website it will join the project. BP Plc is the only other foreign oil major with a stake in a Chinese LNG terminal.  Yuedian did not respond to a request for comment.  The multi-billion dollar bets still faces risks from the Sino-U.S. trade dispute. China has vowed to respond to any new tariffs by the Trump administration, which recently accused China of meddling in November elections and trying to recruit Americans to spy for it. But it remains unclear what that response will be and if it puts agreements like Exxon\u2019s in China in jeopardy.  In addition to the LNG terminal, Exxon received approval for its first wholly-owned chemical plant in China, becoming one of two foreign firms including Germany\u2019s BASF to gain approval to operate such plants without a local sponsor.  The terminal and chemicals plants combined will cost about $9 billion to build, consultancy IHS Markit estimates.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2wDdglt  CALL FOR NEW PROJECTS  China in 2017 embarked on a huge program to shift millions of households and factories from coal to natural gas for power and heating, a move to clear the smoggy skies over its cities.  That surge has injected new life into an LNG industry that suffered from plunging prices between 2014 and 2017, which forced energy companies to put off liquefaction projects.  But with prices for LNG rising this year, major producers have boosted investment. In addition to Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell PLC this month gave the go-ahead to a $31 billion LNG Canada project that will export fuel primarily to China.  \u201cMajor Independent Oil Companies such as Exxon aim for large-scale tier one positions, and in the LNG game that is Qatar, East Africa, and possibly some North American and Papua New Guinea projects,\u201d said Saul Kavonic, oil and gas researcher for Credit Suisse in Sydney, Australia.  Exxon and other LNG producers also are adapting to changing buyer behavior. In the past, LNG was dominated by long-term supply contracts - especially with Japanese and South Korean buyers - that could span several decades and in which buyer and seller agree to a fixed monthly volume at a set price formula, usually priced off crude oil.  That is changing, in part because China\u2019s importers either demand more contract flexibility or simply buy LNG at short-notice in the spot market whenever they need it.  The shift away from such rigid price-supply deals is forcing producers to trade new LNG supplies and give import terminals a larger role in encouraging spot purchases.  \u201cLNG players are increasingly adopting an LNG portfolio model whereby supply projects are not directly linked to end customers, with over 50 percent of contracts now coming from portfolio suppliers rather than specific projects,\u201d said Credit Suisse\u2019s Kavonic.","285":"A logo of Exxon Mobil is displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017.

Irving, Texas-based Exxon entered talks with Algeria\u2019s national oil company Sonatrach several months ago to develop a field in the southwestern Ahnet basin, the sources close to the discussions said.  The talks were part of a deepening of ties between the two companies that followed Sonatrach\u2019s acquisition last May of Exxon\u2019s Augusta refinery in Sicily, Italy.  Last week, officials from the two sides held talks in Houston, Texas to hammer out details but Exxon opted to suspend the discussions, temporarily at least, due to the recent protests in Algeria over President Abdelaziz Bouteflika\u2019s 20-year rule, the sources said.  Exxon and Sonatrach declined to comment.  The refinery acquisition and increased cooperation between the two companies were seen as key for Sonatrach\u2019s efforts to modernise its business and reduce reliance on fuel imports under Chief Executive Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour.  The collapse of the talks follows years of attempts by Sonatrach to attract foreign companies to develop its vast oil and natural gas resources.  Sonatrach hopes to tap foreign experience in fracking, a drilling technique that led to the rapid expansion of U.S. oil and gas production, to develop its own shale reserves, estimated at 22 trillion cubic metres, the world\u2019s third largest.  The North African country is a leading gas supplier to Europe, but exports have suffered from delays to several projects and a steep rise in the use of subsidised gas at home as the population has grown.

FILE PHOTO: A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Sergio Moraes - File Photo  The company also has begun hiring and training staff to operate what would be a third crude distillation unit at the site. The expansion would increase crude processing capacity at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery by at least 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the current 365,644 bpd, the sources said.  The proposed unit would convert crude oil from Texas shale fields into refined products, including diesel and gasoline. Exxon wants to triple daily crude production in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent by 2025.  Initial work has begun and construction of the crude unit is scheduled to start next year after a final investment decision, with processing beginning by 2022, spokeswoman Sarah Nordin confirmed in an email this week.  \u201cThe company is proceeding with front-end engineering, design and other preparatory work to further increase the refinery\u2019s crude refining capacity,\u201d Nordin said.  Nordin did not describe specific steps being taken at the refinery to prepare for the new crude unit, which is part of a $20 billion program to expand its U.S. Gulf Coast manufacturing over 10 years.  The refinery added an initial eight operators, who are gaining experience working on the two existing crude units. They will move over to the new processing unit after it is built, the sources said.  Another element of the company\u2019s preparations involves raising the site to resist flooding. The plant was swamped and shut by torrential rains from Hurricane Harvey last year and was not able to be fully returned to service for 36 days.  \u201cThey\u2019re building up the soil 10 to 14 feet (3 to 4.3 meters),\u201d one of the sources said.  The ground-level increase would place the base of the new crude unit above the level of Harvey\u2019s flood waters.  Exxon also is taking steps to increase crude delivery. It has agreed to join with Plains All American Pipeline LP on a pipeline to carry 1 million barrels per day of crude oil from the Permian Basin to Exxon refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Exxon is not the only refiner looking to expand along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] is seeking to buy or build another U.S. refinery and Chevron Corp recently said it is considering adding a refinery on the western U.S. Gulf Coast.

Analysts had forecast a $1.08 a share profit excluding one-time items, according to data from Refinitiv.  Exxon\u2019s oil equivalent production rose to just over 4 million barrels per day, up from 3.9 million bpd in the same period the year prior. The company said its output in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. shale basin, rose 90 percent over a year ago.  Results for oil and gas production were \u201cespecially strong,\u201d said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones. \u201cIt was a good quarter to end the year. I think the focus now will be on improving the cash flow,\u201d he said.  Exxon is not planning share buybacks this quarter, though, which makes it the only international oil company \u201cnot currently repurchasing shares,\u201d analysts with Simmons Energy said in a client note.  The company now expects to spend $30 billion this year, up from about $28 billion it had forecast previously, and analysts at J.P.

Pretax earnings in its refining business were $2.7 billion, up $1.70 billion over the same period the year prior.  Exxon earned $1.1 billion more pretax in its upstream business than it did in the fourth quarter of 2017, and said higher natural gas prices were partially offset by lower liquids pricing.  Pretax profits in Exxon\u2019s chemicals business were down $191 million on weaker margins, growth-related expenses and higher downtime and maintenance.  Woods credited better-than-expected results to the company optimizing its operations across the board, and said it has an advantage because of its ability to tie decisions in the oil field to logistics and refining.  \u201cIrrespective of where we are in the cycle, we\u2019re going to be advantaged versus the rest of industry,\u201d he said.

Production declines have been a significant issue in previous quarters for Exxon and it is a \u201cpositive sign\u201d that production improved in the fourth quarter, said Muhammed Ghulam, analyst with Raymond James. But he noted the earnings beat was \u201cpartially driven by one-time asset sale gains of more than $800 million\u201d from a refinery sale.  Exxon shares closed up 3.6 percent at $75.92.

The United Nations has warned that the Safer, stranded since 2015, could spill four times as much oil as the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster near Alaska, but access to the vessel has been complicated by the war in Yemen.  Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement, which controls the area where the tanker is moored and the national oil firm that owns it, agreed in July to allow a technical team to assess the ship and conduct whatever repairs may be feasible.  But the two sources said that it could take another seven weeks to finalise details of the agreement and logistics, with the coronavirus pandemic further complicating planning.  The deal includes the eventual sale of the oil on board with proceeds divided between Houthi authorities and Yemen\u2019s internationally recognised government, which the movement ousted from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014.  Some diplomats say there are still doubts about the mission as Houthi officials had last year reneged on granting access.  The Safer, built in 1974, is moored off the Ras Issa oil terminal, 60 km (40 miles) north of the port of Hodeidah.  The area is held by the Houthis, but the high seas are controlled by a Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the movement and has prevented it from selling oil.  U.N. and Houthi officials say water has entered the Safer\u2019s engine room at least twice since 2015. The latest leak in May was plugged by Safer Corp divers and Houthi naval units.  While the Houthis can fix small leaks it remains unclear how long such repairs can hold, U.N. officials and experts said.  Last month, Riyadh warned that an \u201coil spot\u201d was seen in a shipping transit area 31 miles (50 km) west of the tanker.  The United Nations says a major rupture could severely harm Red Sea ecosystems and shut Hodeidah port, Yemen\u2019s main entry point for imports and aid.","293":"HOUSTON, May 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are slamming the brakes on U.S. shale oil production at a time when crude prices and fuel demand have plunged due to global lockdowns to fight the coronavirus pandemic.  Both companies on Friday outlined deep cuts in output and investments in the Permian shale basin, the top U.S. oilfield where growth in recent years made America the world\u2019s top oil producer and a net exporter for the first time in decades.  Oil and gas output at both U.S. producers rose in the first quarter ahead of planned cuts. Each had been racing to hit 1 million barrels per day of production in the Permian. But fuel demand sank nearly a third this year as travel and business lockdowns collided with a flood of Russian and Saudi oil hitting the market when those countries abandoned production cuts.  Prices for U.S. crude have dropped nearly 70% this year, and actually settled in negative territory on April 20 for the first time ever. On Friday, Exxon and Chevron, the two top U.S. oil producers, announced shut-ins of up to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) this quarter, much of it from their U.S. shale units.  The two oil majors spent heavily in the last two years to expand in the Permian. Shale production can be brought on faster than deepwater and other oil exploration projects but requires near-constant drilling to maintain output. Both companies have been rapidly sidelining Permian drilling equipment since prices crashed starting in March.  \u201cWe would intend to bring activity back to the Permian when we see prices recover,\u201d said Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber in an interview.  Exxon posted a $610 million first-quarter loss, its first quarterly loss in three decades, on a nearly $3 billion inventory writedown reflecting lower margins and prices. Chevron posted a $3.6 billion profit on asset sales and improved refining results, and also said it would further reduce spending this year.  (For a graphic on Exxon's earnings, click here: tmsnrt.rs\/3aTTnrp)  Both companies will slash spending budgets by 30% this year. Chevron cut its capital spending budget to $14 billion and Exxon has set 2020 spending at $23 billion, the lowest in four years. Both said spending cuts will weigh heavily on shale.  Even though their results topped Wall Street\u2019s reduced estimates, Exxon shares fell 4.5% at $44.35 while Chevron dropped 3.4% to $88.90.  U.S. crude futures have recovered since settling in negative territory on April 20, but the current price of around $19 per barrel remains below the cost of production for many.  Both Chevron and Exxon maintained their quarterly dividends.  Other oil majors are also slashing investments and seeking ways to conserve cash. Royal Dutch Shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War II and reported first-quarter profits down nearly half compared to a year-ago. BP Plc\u2019s first-quarter profit tumbled by two-thirds and its debt climbed to its highest on record.","294":"LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil will expand its Rovuma liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique by half to cut production costs as the partners prepare to book the plant\u2019s supply and formally tap lenders in September, the company told Reuters.

It now aims to build the world\u2019s biggest liquefaction units, or trains, outside Qatar, in Mozambique\u2019s remote north, shelving former operator Eni\u2019s more modest blueprint in pursuit of cost savings to boost returns on investment.  \u201cThe larger train design will lower the unit cost of the Rovuma LNG project and ensure a competitive new supply for the global LNG market,\u201d Exxon spokeswoman Julie King said in response to emailed questions.  Under new development plans submitted to the government this week, Exxon\u2019s first two liquefaction trains should each produce 7.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), with a start date in 2024.  Eni initially planned 5 mtpa trains.  The Italian oil major holds the offshore resource license to Area 4, which contains some 85 trillion cubic feet of gas in place to be supercooled into a liquid and exported on ships to world markets.  Super-sizing the first two trains means having to renegotiate a resource-sharing deal Eni struck in 2015 with rival LNG project developer Anadarko Petroleum, which owns the neighboring Area 1 license, industry sources said.  A geologically porous section of Area 4 covering the Mamba and Prosperidade fields straddles Area 1. This effectively means Exxon-Eni would pump gas away from Anadarko\u2019s adjoining reservoir to feed its LNG plant.  \u201cArea 4 and Area 1 stakeholders have agreed on the Unitization and Unit Operating Agreement (UUOA) which has been presented to the Mozambican government for approval,\u201d Exxon\u2019s King said.  Anadarko spokeswoman Helen Wells said the company was engaging with the government and Area 4 to address any concerns and ensure the UUOA benefits all involved.  COMMERCIAL STRUCTURES  Mozambique\u2019s two rival LNG projects are ramping up to take final investment decisions (FID) in 2019 and both are teeing up buyers and loans to underpin hefty construction costs.  But there the similarities end.  Anadarko Petroleum\u2019s approach involves raising a record $14-$15 billion from banks and export credit agencies (ECAs) to fund the build. At the same time, it is lining up long-term LNG sales deals with external companies in China, Asia and Europe to guarantee the loans.  Exxon in contrast will finance a larger share of costs from its own pockets as well as drawing on project partners, including Eni, Korea Gas Corp and China National Petroleum Corporation [CNPET.UL], bank and industry sources say.  Exxon said it expects Rovuma LNG financing to originate from a mix of \u201cexternal lenders and joint-venture party funding.\u201d  \u201cWe have begun initial engagement with lenders and are planning a formal kick-off event in September 2018,\u201d King said.  Exxon already approached those ECAs that backed Eni\u2019s Coral South Floating LNG project in Area 4 last year, sources said.  For its part, Anadarko engaged commercial banks on May 21 after having first secured interest for about $12 billion from ECAs.  Production from Rovuma LNG will also be treated differently.  While Anadarko sought out buyers from France\u2019s EDF to Britain\u2019s Centrica and Japan\u2019s Tokyo Gas, Exxon is holding talks for binding sales and purchase agreements for Rovuma output with subsidiaries of its Area 4 project partners.  \u201cWe expect sufficient interest from the affiliate buyers to launch the project and support the financing,\u201d King said.","295":"ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The world\u2019s most famous sled-dog race, celebrated by Alaskans for half a century but condemned by animal-rights activists as inhumane, is losing one of its biggest corporate sponsors.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), a longtime Iditarod foe, claimed a victory with the decision.  \u201cNo reputable company wants to associate with a race that forces dogs to run until they collapse,\u201d PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman said, calling on other sponsors to quit \u201cthis spectacle of suffering.\u201d  Animal rights activists have criticized the Iditarod for pushing its dog teams too hard in racing and training, and for subjecting its canine contestants to dangerous conditions. Five dogs died during or immediately after 2017\u2019s race.  Iditarod mushers and officials have long defended their dog-care record, citing the army of volunteer veterinarians involved and extensive dog health screening conducted before each race.  In response to Exxon\u2019s decision, PETA plans to withdraw its Iditarod-related shareholder resolution and cancel an anti-Exxon advertising and protest campaign set to start next week, the group said.  Iditarod representatives were not immediately available for comment.  Exxon\u2019s move follows the loss in recent years of such longtime corporate sponsors as Alaska Airlines and Wells Fargo.  This year\u2019s race has been sharply pared back due to the coronavirus pandemic to an 860-mile out-and-back trail instead of the traditional 1,000-mile route from Anchorage to Nome.  The race is due to start in Anchorage on March 6.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), the fund arm of insurer Legal & General which has 1 trillion pounds under management, has been among the most vocal asset managers on climate risks, and will also divest from Hormel Foods, Korea Electric Power Corp, Kroger and Metlife.  The divestment applies only to LGIM\u2019s Future World funds, which it says are set up for clients who want to express a conviction on environmental, social and governance themes.  \u201cIn all other LGIM (non-Future World) funds that remain invested in those companies that have not met our criteria, we will vote against the election of the chair of the board,\u201d said Meryam Omi, head of sustainability and responsible investment strategy at LGIM.  \u201cWe can vote against the chair on any number of issues, so to do so because of a single issue such as climate change sends a powerful message to companies that they should be raising their standards in this area.\u201d  As part of its Climate Impact Pledge, launched in 2016, LGIM has sought to engage with the largest companies in the oil and gas, mining, electric utilities, autos, food retail and financial sectors on climate change and said it would take action.  \u201cExxonMobil Corporation has not met our key minimum requirements, including on emissions reporting and targets,\u201d LGIM said in its report.  LGIM said meeting the 2015 Paris climate agreement goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius would mean cutting fossil fuel use by a third by 2040.  Some institutional investors have pressed Exxon to define a path toward meeting the Paris agreement, but the company has not committed to any such targets.  Exxon said it was committed to improving efficiency and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in its operations and that it discloses its so-called scope one and scope two emissions.  Scope one encompasses direct emissions from a company\u2019s operations which it can control, while scope two relates to indirect emissions from the electricity used by a company.  \u201cWe\u2019re also providing solutions to consumers to help them reduce their emissions and are developing next-generation lower-emissions solutions, like carbon capture and storage and advanced biofuels,\u201d spokesman Scott Silvestri said.  \u201cWe\u2019re on track to meet greenhouse gas reduction measures we announced last year, which are expected to help significantly to improve emissions performance. They include a 15% decrease in methane emissions and a 25% reduction in flaring by 2020.\u201d  Last month, shareholders defeated measures calling for a special board committee on climate change and for a report on the climate risks.  LGIM said Exxon lagged behind European peers such as Equinor, BP and Shell which better disclose their company\u2019s potential climate risks.  Hormel Foods, Korea Electric Power, U.S. retailer Kroger and U.S. insurance company Metlife also failed to meet LGIM\u2019s criteria on climate-related risk disclosure, it said.","298":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp shut a gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) at its 560,500-barrel-per-day (bpd) Baytown, Texas, refinery, two Gulf Coast market sources said on Friday.  Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Nordin declined to discuss the status of specific units, but said the company continued to meet its contractual commitments.  The sources said the larger of two FCCUs was shut within the past 24 hours and may be shut for up to three weeks. Fluidic Catalytic Cracking Unit 3 has a capacity of 125,000 bpd.  One of the sources said FCCU 3 was shut in part because of an overhaul under way on the 42,000 bpd Flexicoker, which began on April 2.  The Flexicoker overhaul began on April 2 and was planned to last six weeks, but sources have told Reuters the work may continue until early June.  Energy industry intelligence service Genscape said that Pipestill 7, the second largest crude distillation unit (CDU) at the Baytown refinery, showed signs increased activity on Friday.  The 135,000 bpd CDU was shut as part of the work on the Flexicoker.  CDUs do the primary refining of crude oil and provide hydrocarbon feedstock for all other units in the refinery. There are three CDUs at the Baytown refinery. The other two crude units remain in production.  A Flexicoker is designed by Exxon to convert residual crude oil to motor fuels and produce industrial fuel gas instead of petroleum coke, a coal substitute.","299":"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey has received information that an Exxon Mobil ship is heading towards the east Mediterranean for oil and gas exploration, President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s spokesman said on Wednesday, amid a row between Ankara and Cyprus on the issue.

REUTERS\/Jessica Rinaldi\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday raised its Guyana oil estimates by 2 billion barrels with disclosure of a new discovery, as it continues to develop one of the world\u2019s most important new oil and gas blocks in the last decade.  The new find continues an Exxon-led consortium\u2019s long string of discoveries in Latin America\u2019s newest crude producing nation and underscores the importance of Guyana to Exxon for increasing its future oil output.  Exxon and partners Hess Corp and China\u2019s CNOOC started production at the Stabroek block ahead of schedule in December. The latest discovery, the 16th by the group, brings total recoverable oil and gas resources to more than 8 billion barrels.  Recoverable oil is accessible by existing drilling technologies and is profitable to pump at current prices. The new discovery would be added to official resource estimates at a later date, Exxon said.  Following Guyana\u2019s first-ever oil export earlier this month, another vessel - the Suezmax tanker Eagle San Antonio - is scheduled to approach Exxon\u2019s offshore producing vessel in coming days for loading the second cargo of Liza light sweet crude for exports, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.  The Yannis P, carrying Guyana\u2019s first crude cargo, is underway to the U.S. Gulf Coast, where Exxon plans to discharge the vessel into its refining network. The shipment marked the tiny South American nation\u2019s long-awaited debut as an oil exporter.  Production from the Liza Phase 1 development is currently ramping up and it will produce up to 120,000 barrels of oil per day in the coming months, the company said.  While Exxon plans to refine Liza crude itself in the short term, Guyana\u2019s government recently awarded Royal Dutch Shell a tender for its first three cargoes and it plans to launch next month a competitive process to choose a marketing agent to trade and export its share of production.

FILE PHOTO: A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Sergio Moraes  Exxon last year slashed spending on new projects by nearly a third, outlined plans to cut up to 15% of its workforce while adding $21 billion to its debt to cover spending and restructuring.  The changes come amid \u201cthe most challenging market conditions Exxon has ever experienced,\u201d said Chief Executive Darren Woods, and over time will cut costs by $6 billion a year compared to 2019.  The company reported a net annual loss of $22.4 billion for 2020, on the writedown and losses in oil production and refining, compared with a full-year profit of $14.34 billion in 2019.  Exxon declined to comment if it has ever had an annual loss, but the company churned out profits since Exxon merged with Mobil in 1999 and through the 1980s oil bust.  OILMAN JOINS BOARD  The company remains under fire from environmentalists and activist investors pushing for a board overhaul and a strategy that would transition to cleaner fuels. Exxon pushed back against their calls for clean energy expertise, naming the former head of Malaysia\u2019s state oil company, Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, to its board. It is in discussions with other candidates, the company added.  Other oil majors posted losses for the year as pandemic-related travel restrictions cut fuel demand and triggered huge writedowns. Rivals BP Plc and Chevron Corp posted annual losses.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc reports financial results Thursday.  Exxon posted a net loss of $20.2 billion, or $4.70 per share, in the fourth-quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $5.69 billion, or $1.33 per share, a year ago. Excluding the impairment and other charges, the company earned 3 cents per share, beating analysts\u2019 average expectation of a one-cent gain, according to Refinitiv IBES data.  Exxon shares, which have lost a quarter of their value in the past 12 months, rose 1.6% to $45.62 on Tuesday.  \u201cThe turnaround story will take some time,\u201d said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, noting that the company is not yet covering its dividend and capital spending with cash from operations.  But with oil prices recovering, Exxon can start to cover dividend and begin paying down the $68 billion in debt on its balance sheet, Woods said. Oil is up 11% so far this year, and trading at pre-pandemic levels.  Exxon still has \u201cplenty of wood to chop\u201d but the willingness to cut costs to pay the dividend will play well with investors, said Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds.  Project spending fell nearly a third last year and this year will near the bottom of the company\u2019s $16 billion to $19 billion forecast, Woods said. Spending will rise to as much as $25 billion from 2022 through 2025, he said.  LOWER OUTPUT IN OIL AND REFINING  Exxon\u2019s oil and gas output was 3.7 million barrels of oil and gas per day in the fourth quarter, down 8% compared with a year earlier.  It projects a doubling of Permian Basin output to 700,000 barrels per day by 2025, down from the million-barrel target it previously had expected to hit by 2024 in the top U.S. shale field, Woods said.  Exploration and production, Exxon\u2019s largest business, lost $18.5 billion in the fourth quarter on the natural gas asset impairments, compared with a profit of $6.1 billion the year prior.  Its chemicals business earned $691 million on better margins in part from lower oil prices, up from a loss of $355 million a year ago. Refining lost $1.2 billion, compared with a profit of $898 million last year, on weak margins and lower output as the pandemic limited global travel.  The writedown lays bare the size of the miscalculation that the company made in 2010 when it paid $30 billion for U.S. shale oil and gas producer XTO Energy.  The move to shake up its board comes as Exxon faces a proxy fight with hedge fund Engine No. 1, which has proposed four candidates and wants the board to include clean-energy experience.  \u201cExxon Mobil shareholders deserve a board that works proactively to create long-term value, not defensively in the face of deteriorating returns and the threat of losing their seats,\u201d Engine No.1 said in a statement.  On Monday, Exxon said it would invest $3 billion on lower emission solutions through 2025 and that it has created a business that will focus on commercializing its carbon capture technology.","302":"HOUSTON, March 16 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp cut back gasoline production at its 560,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baytown, Texas, refinery after a hydrotreater fire on Saturday, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Emergency crews worked to extinguish the fire into the evening, the company said in a statement. The cause of the blaze was not disclosed, but an investigation was under way and Exxon said it was cooperating with authorities.  The injured workers were treated for minor burns, none requiring hospitalization, plant manager Jason Duncan told a news briefing.  The fire, which was put down by the company\u2019s employees, sent black smoke into the air over the complex in Baytown, a city of 75,000 which is located about 30 miles (48 km) east of Houston. Firefighters and equipment from the city entered the plant at midday to assist, an official said.  Firefighters continued to spray water on a charred column where the fire began late Wednesday. Residents around the plant were told to close windows and doors, turn off air conditioning and remain in their homes, schools or offices. A shelter in place order was lifted after several hours.  \u201cWe are cooperating with regulatory agencies. We deeply regret any disruption or inconvenience that this incident may have caused the community,\u201d Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Nordin said in a statement.  Available air monitoring information from the inside the Baytown Olefins Plant\u2019s grounds and outside monitoring sources recorded no adverse impacts, she said. The fire burned residual fuel contained in a large column on Wednesday.  The Baytown complex that includes the olefins plant where the fire occurred employs about 7,000 people among four manufacturing sites that cover 3,400 acres (13.8 square kilometers). It sits along the Houston Ship Channel, the nation\u2019s largest and busiest energy port.  Duncan declined to comment on the fire\u2019s impact on production at Exxon\u2019s adjacent 560,500 barrels-per-day oil refinery. Two people familiar with its operations said Exxon reduced some production at the refinery, which provides feedstocks to the unit that caught fire.  Aerial footage during the blaze showed flames and heavy smoke emanating from a large column at the facility, which Exxon identified as part of its production of olefins, a component of plastic. Emergency vehicles and people were massing around the edge of the complex.  The company said a total of 66 staff and contract workers were examined and released during the day at a nearby health clinic which provides first aid.  Exxon last year completed the construction of a multi-billion-dollar ethane cracker at the Baytown Olefins Plant. The cracker can produce 1.5 million tons per year, and provides feedstock to two other production lines at its Mont Belvieu, Texas, plastics plant.","306":"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has selected groups that include Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell to build five liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals as it aims to triple imports and ease gas shortages. The terminals could be in operation within two to three years, Omar Ayub Khan, Pakistan\u2019s minister of power and petroleum, said in an interview on Friday.  A Shell logo is seen at a gas station in Buenos Aires, Argentina, March 12, 2018.

The groups selected to build terminals are Tabeer Energy, a unit of Mitsubishi Corp; Exxon and Energas; Trafigura Group and Pakistan GasPort; Shell and Engro Corp; and Gunvor Group and Fatima.  It was not immediately clear if the companies involved had made final investment decisions to proceed.  The five must submit plan details to the ministry of ports and shipping by Nov. 5 for approval, but cabinet has already approved them, Khan said.  Pakistan\u2019s two LNG terminals currently have 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of capacity, and a third expected to come on line next year will add 600 million cubic feet per day, Khan said.  The country has sought bids for a 10-year LNG supply tender for the current terminals and the results will be announced in two to three weeks, Khan said.  It was unclear what capacity the five new terminals will have, but Khan said they could collectively triple Pakistan\u2019s LNG import capacity.  The arrests this summer of two LNG industry executives by the National Accountability Bureau raised some concerns about the risks of investing in Pakistan.  But Khan said the interest of five investment groups speaks for itself.  \u201cThat is a ringing endorsement that (Pakistan\u2019s) policies are clear and transparent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a competitive market.\u201d  The cost of building the terminals and finding buyers for the gas will be up to the groups, and they will pay Pakistan a royalty based on volume, Khan said.  Pakistan\u2019s contribution will be funding construction of a $2 billion north-south pipeline to distribute the gas, and storage facilities, he said.  Pakistan\u2019s fertilizer industry has coped in the past year with a steep increase in government-set natural gas prices, Sher Shah Malik, executive director of Fertilizer Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council, said in an interview on Thursday.  Gas is the main ingredient in production of urea fertilizer.  Two of Pakistan\u2019s urea plants lack gas to run regularly, and one closed last year, forcing Pakistan to import fertilizer.  Since LNG is often too expensive for making fertilizer, the government should also expand domestic gas exploration before reserves are depleted, Malik said.  \u201cWe are heading for very difficult times,\u201d he said. \u201cIf nothing happens, we\u2019ll be high and dry.\u201d","307":"Dec 13 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has made a final investment decision to develop the West Barracouta gas field in the Bass Strait to bring new gas supplies to the Australian market, it said in a statement on Thursday.

FILE PHOTO: An airplane comes in for a landing above an Exxon sign at a gas station in the Chicago suburb of Norridge, Illinois, U.S., October 27, 2016. REUTERS\/Jim Young\/File Photo  More than two years of negotiations on awarding the U.S. firm a project to build a water treatment facility and related pipelines needed to boost Iraq\u2019s oil production capacity have hit difficulties because the two sides differ on contract terms and costs, the officials and sources told Reuters.  Unless the differences can be resolved, the project could be awarded to another company in a tender, the officials said, without elaborating on the points of dispute.  Losing the contract could deal a blow to Exxon\u2019s broader Iraqi plans, as it would be handed rights to develop at least two southern oilfields - Nahr Bin Umar and Artawi - as part of the deal.  Exxon declined to comment.  Further delays to the project could also hold back the oil industry in Iraq, OPEC\u2019s second-largest producer; the country needs to inject water into its wells or risk losing pressure and face severe decline rates, especially at its mature oilfields. As freshwater is a scarce resource in Iraq, using treated seawater is one of the best alternatives.  The Common Seawater Supply Project (CSSP), which would supply water to more than six southern oilfields, including Exxon's existing West Qurna 1 field and BP's BP.L Rumaila, was initially planned to be completed in 2013 but has now been delayed until 2022.  \u201cThe CSSP would be expensive and challenging but there\u2019s opportunity here (for Exxon) ... to get access to resources on a very large scale and to achieve something and really make a difference to its own business,\u201d said Ian Thom, principal analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  Many of the world's biggest oil companies, like BP, Total TOTF.PA, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Eni ENI.MI, have operations in Iraq, where a low-return environment and strict contract terms have squeezed returns in recent years.  With total oil production at West Qurna 1 at around 430,000 bpd, Exxon\u2019s presence in Iraq is small compared with dominant player BP whose Rumaila oilfield accounts for around a third of the country\u2019s total production of around 4.4 million bpd.  While the Texas-based firm is looking to grow in Iraq, its geographical focus remains on the Americas, including U.S. shale fields and Brazil, in contrast to rivals like France\u2019s Total and Italy\u2019s Eni who have been significantly expanding their activities in the Middle East in recent years.  \u2018ANOTHER APPROACH\u2019  The talks between Iraqi authorities and Exxon are still ongoing, according to the industry sources and officials from the Iraqi oil ministry.  However the state-run Basra Oil Company (BOC), which is overseeing the project, said it could now tender the project this month in a parallel process with the aim of completing a first phase by 2022.  \u201cWe have this one approach but we can have another approach as well,\u201d Abdul Mahdi al-Ameedi, head of the Iraqi oil ministry\u2019s licensing and contracts office, told Reuters.  Iraq chose Exxon to coordinate the initial studies of the CSSP in 2010 [story here here]. At the time, Baghdad aimed to raise its oil production capacity to 12 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2018, rivaling Saudi Arabia. That target has been missed and now been cut to 6.5 million bpd by 2022 from around 5 million bpd now.  \u201cIraq can probably get to 5.5 million bpd production without a major seawater supply project, but I think they will struggle to get to 7 million bpd,\u201d said Thom.  Negotiations with Exxon fell through in 2012 due to red tape and cost disputes. In 2015, the company reentered talks with the oil ministry, this time in partnership with China's CNPC and with the CSSP folded into a much bigger development project known as the Integrated South Project. [story here here]  CNPC did not reply to a request for comment.  For Iraq, going down the non-Exxon route raises two major concerns: how to integrate the project between the water treatment facility and the oilfields and how to finance the project, Thom said.  Two Iraqi oil sources told Reuters that taking the non-Exxon path would raise financing concerns for Iraq.  \u201cIf you decouple it, it\u2019s not the same project,\u201d one of the industry sources said of a non-integrated project.  Projected costs of the scheme have not been disclosed.  ILF Consulting Engineers, which did the front end engineering and design (FEED) for the project in 2014 based on treating 12.5 million bpd of seawater transported to six oilfields, put the cost at $12 billion.  The capacity has been revised downwards, with the first phase set to have a 5 million bpd of water, and in the second phase an additional 2.5 million bpd of water will be added for additional fields.","310":"GEORGETOWN, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Guyana is close to reaching a deal with Exxon Mobil Corp to approve the company\u2019s Payara project, after the company committed to stricter environmental restrictions on gas flaring and wastewater, a top government official said on Friday.  Exxon, along with consortium partners Hess Corp and China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd, expects to eventually produce 220,000 barrels per day of crude from Payara, its third major oil development in the Stabroek block off the South American country\u2019s coast.  The companies have overall discovered more than 8 billion barrels of recoverable resource off Guyana. The discovery is poised to transform the economy of the small, poor country of fewer than 800,000 people, which had no history of oil production before late last year.  The breakthrough on Payara came after a months-long government review, which was delayed in part due to a contentious March election and transfer of power in August. Exxon had warned the delays put its plans to bring the project online in 2023 in jeopardy.  \u201cWe are almost in the final lap to having a workable agreement for both sides,\u201d Natural Resources Minister Vickram Bharrat told Reuters. \u201cOnce cabinet gives the green light, there will be a public signing.\u201d  An Exxon spokesman said the company is still working with the government \u201cto obtain final approvals for the development of the Payara offshore oil field.\u201d  \u201cUpon receiving all required government approvals, we will seek a final investment decision to develop the field,\u201d the spokesman said.

While one-time asset sales or write downs were large factors, the two companies said earnings suffered from weaker margins in crude oil, chemicals and fuel production. They gave tepid outlooks for the near term.  Shares of Exxon and Chevron were both at least 3% lower in morning trade on the mixed results and worries about slowing global economic growth.  Fourth-quarter results at Exxon fell below Wall Street\u2019s recently lowered estimate, with earnings of $5.6 billion, down from $6 billion a year ago. Its per share profit excluding one-time gain from asset sales was 41 cents, below Wall Street\u2019s estimate of 43 cents and 71 cents prior to a recent warning.  Chevron swung to a loss of $6.61 billion from a year-earlier profit of $3.73 billion. The company had $10 billion in charges including writedowns on the value of oil and gas properties that were no longer economic to pump. Excluding charges, its $1.49 cent a share profit topped estimates.  This week, Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s shares hit a three-year low after it laid out a plan to pull back on share buybacks amid slower global growth and weak commodity prices.  Exxon CEO Darren Woods said its natural gas, refining and chemicals businesses have suffered from near or at decade-low prices. Exxon will keep investing in new projects, he said, describing the margin weakness as \u201ca short-term impact.\u201d","314":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Weaker second-quarter refining and chemicals profits offset surging U.S. shale production at U.S. oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Chevron Corp CVX.N, the two reported on Friday.

Chevron earnings rose 26%, in line with forecasts, as it benefited from a one-time, $1-billion breakup fee from Anadarko Petroleum APC.N, which accepted a higher bid from Occidental Petroleum OXY.N after agreeing to sell itself to Chevron.  Shares of both companies fell on Friday with Exxon off 1% at $71.75 a share and Chevron down a penny at $120.73 as the market fell on U.S.-China trade concerns.  Exxon's weaker earnings mirrored those at rivals Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Total SA TOTF.PA, and both U.S. companies said natural gas prices and chemical margins fell from a year-earlier.  Shell\u2019s profit was its smallest in 30 months, due to weaker chemicals, refining and tumbling natural gas prices. Total also cited weaker natural gas and refining operations for earnings that fell 19% from a year ago.  Exxon\u2019s net income fell to $3.13 billion, or 73 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $3.95 billion, or 92 cents per share, last year. Analysts had slashed their estimates last month after the company disclosed weaker results in natural gas, chemicals and refining.  \u201cPretty weak quarter from them once again,\u201d said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. After spending on major projects and dividends, Exxon had a free cash flow shortfall of $2.7 billion, she said. Investors closely watch that measure as a sign of the company\u2019s financial health.  Exxon\u2019s chemicals business fell to a loss in the United States for the first time in at least three years and earnings have declined for five quarters in a row. It collected lower profits from refining due to higher costs and lost production at several plants.  The largest U.S. oil producer by volume has been investing in major projects to boost production at a time when investors have been pressing oil companies to cut spending and increase returns to shareholders.  In a call with analysts, Exxon Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said despite weak market conditions in three of the company\u2019s businesses, \u201con the whole, our businesses performance extremely well.\u201d  He pointed to the company\u2019s 90% year-over-year in Permian production and a 7% overall increase in its oil and gas production.  Exxon remains on track to increase its drilling in the top U.S. shale field and had its \u201ceyes wide open\u201d for potential acquisitions there, Chapman said. It remains committed to selling about $15 billion in assets through 2021, although proceeds this year have totaled $140 million, down from $1.75 billion a year earlier.  Chevron\u2019s Permian Basin production rose 50% from the same period a year ago and is overall output hit 3.08 million barrels per day, up 9% from a year ago and a record level.

The tanker Cap Philippe, which is approaching Guyanese waters, is expected to load 1 million barrels of the light sweet crude. The cargo, along with another two to come, was sold by Guyana to Royal Dutch Shell RDSA.L in a December tender.  The government of the South American nation, which late last year became an oil producer, is expected to receive at least five cargoes of crude produced by the Exxon-led consortium this year, or about 13,700 barrels per day (bpd), the Energy Department\u2019s director, Mark Bynoe, said in a statement.  Guyana plans to call oil firms to a competitive process later this month to select the \u2018marketing agent\u2019 that will be in charge of trading the government\u2019s share of oil produced. The terms of the process have not yet been published.

A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Sergio Moraes  In a break from its past, Exxon has been building a global cadre of experienced traders and beefing up risk management systems to lift profit.  Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company by market capitalization, has historically stood apart from rivals by limiting trading activity out of concerns it would be accused of market manipulation.  The oil major has lagged behind rivals BP Plc, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which have created trading units that occasionally generate more profit than their refining businesses.  Both Rubinstein and Paradise, both of whom will be based in Houston, left commodity trader Noble Group Ltd in 2017.  Rubinstein was managing director and global head of crude oil at Noble until 2017, when rival Vitol SA agreed to buy Noble Americas Corp. Noble was once Asia\u2019s biggest commodity trader, and has restructured after facing insolvency last year.  Before Noble, Paradise was Citigroup Inc\u2019s director of oil trading in Houston.  Exxon also recently hired Gary Pace, a senior gasoline trader, sources familiar with his move said. Pace was most recently at investment bank Macquarie in Houston and previously worked for Shell\u2019s U.S. trading arm, according to his LinkedIn profile.  Last year, Exxon hired at least four gasoline market specialists from refiner Phillips 66. In 2018, it also hired former BHP Billiton Plc trader Nelson Lee as an international crude trader.  A spokeswoman for Exxon declined to comment. Pace and Rubinstein did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Rubinstein updated his LinkedIn profile to reflect his move to Exxon, but his exact title is not clear. A source familiar with the matter said he has already started at the company.  Exxon has been aiming to expand trading and marketing around more of its growing energy assets to get the best prices for its products and increase earnings.  \u201cThat is the style of the guys they are hiring,\u201d one industry source said.  This week, Exxon said its oil and gas reserves rose nearly 23 percent last year, driven mainly by increases from holdings in U.S. shale, offshore Guyana and Brazil.","320":"WASHINGTON\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted oil major Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N a financial hardship waiver this year temporarily freeing its Montana refinery from U.S. biofuel laws, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  FILE PHOTO: A gas pump displays the price for E15, a gasoline with 15 percent of ethanol, and various other ethanol blends at a gas station in Nevada, Iowa, United States, May 17, 2015. REUTERS\/Jim Young\/File Photo  Exxon, which reported earnings of almost $20 billion in 2017, became the largest known company to be awarded a such a waiver by the Trump administration\u2019s EPA under a program meant to protect the smallest fuel facilities from going bust.  Farm state lawmakers have complained that the hardship waivers are being overused in a way that is killing demand for corn-based ethanol, and they were likely to criticize the waiver awarded to one of the world\u2019s biggest and most profitable companies.  The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel each year or buy compliance credits from competitors that do. But it allows the EPA to exempt plants of less than 75,000 barrels per day if they show complying would cause financial hardship.  The EPA has vastly expanded the program under President Donald Trump, but is reviewing how it handles further requests as it seeks to balance the competing interests of refiners and ethanol producers.  Exxon\u2019s waiver was granted before the review began, and covers its 60,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Billings, Montana, for the 2017 compliance period, said the sources, who asked not to be named.  EPA spokesman Michael Abboud declined to comment on whether the refinery received a waiver, but pointed out that the waiver program requires the agency only to consider the financial situation of the refinery and not its owner.  \u201cThis was a decision Congress made when drafting the Renewable Fuel Standard and EPA implements the small refinery exemption program consistent with that explicit direction,\u201d he told Reuters in an emailed statement.  ExxonMobil declined to comment.  Reuters reported earlier this year that Andeavor MRO.N and Chevron CVX.N, both large and highly profitable refiners, were also granted recent EPA exemptions for their small facilities.  The EPA keeps the identities of companies receiving waivers secret, arguing the information is business sensitive. But the agency recently began publishing the numbers of exemptions granted. It said it awarded 29 exemptions to small refineries in 2018 for the 2017 compliance year so far, up from 19 for 2016 and just seven for 2015.  WIND OF CHANGE?  The EPA has attributed the program\u2019s expansion mainly to a lawsuit brought by two oil refiners that challenged its denial of their waiver requests under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.  A federal judge ruled last year the EPA was using too narrow a test to evaluate applications. The EPA, which relies partly on advice from the Department of Energy, has asked DOE to review its scoring system for applications before considering additional waiver requests.  Biofuel backers have argued that the waiver program\u2019s expansion was politically driven by former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, a supporter of the fossil fuels industry who sought ways to lower compliance costs for energy companies.  Republican Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa responded to the news with a call for an overhaul of the waiver process.  \u201cThat Exxon was reportedly granted a \u2018small refiner\u2019 waiver for \u2018hardship\u2019 just goes to show how abused the process has been,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \u201cThere\u2019s no good reason multibillion dollar oil refining giants should be able to skirt the law.\u201d  Pruitt resigned amid a slew of ethics scandals last July and has been replaced in the interim by his deputy Andrew Wheeler.  Trump has said he was likely to nominate Wheeler to serve as the permanent EPA chief. That would require U.S. Senate confirmation, and several powerful pro-corn Senators such as Grassley are agitating for measures to protect ethanol demand.  \u201cI suspect Wheeler would be more invested in maintaining the reputation of the agency,\u201d a biofuels industry participant said, asking not to be named. \u201cHe also would not want to upset people who will have a say in his confirmation.\u201d","321":"Oct 9 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is considering a sale of its Malaysian upstream offshore assets for up to $3 billion, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.

Seven Exxon employees are in Algeria inspecting the country\u2019s geology and other factors for a possible agreement, Kaddour said.  \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see an Exxon agreement soon, before the end of the year,\u201d he said.  Exxon declined to comment.  OPEC  Algeria sees last week\u2019s agreement from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost output as a \u201cgood deal\u201d and the country has increased output by 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day, Kaddour said.  \u201cIf this (OPEC) agreement falls apart, there\u2019s no control on the price\u201d of oil, he said. \u201cYou have Saudi (Arabia) and Russia that want to increase as much as they can produce, and then you have the other side, like Iran and other countries, that do not want that increase.  \u201cWe need to stay together as a group. Keeping that equilibrium alive is the most important thing.\u201d  Kaddour, who took the top spot at Sonatrach last year, has launched a long-term strategy \u201cSH 2030.\u201d It targets $67 billion of additional revenues by 2030, of which 50 percent will be reinvested.  As part of that, Sonatrach is working to boost natural gas exports to Europe and other markets. Exports are the largest sources of hard currency for Algeria, and the company has space available on export pipe to Europe, he said.  The company is spending $10 billion this year to boost its production, Kaddour said.  \u201cWe want to increased our share of the international market in oil and gas,\u201d Kaddour said.  Sonatrach is also in talks with Chevron Corp to start a trading and marketing business for its crude oil and natural gas, Kaddour said. Chevron declined to comment.

The agreement comes as U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp , as part of a consortium with Hess Corp and China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd, ramps up crude output from Guyana\u2019s massive offshore Stabroek block, a large portion of which is in waters claimed by Venezuela.  \u201cGreater security, greater capacity to understand your border space, what\u2019s happening inside your Exclusive Economic Zone - those are all things that give Guyana sovereignty,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a joint appearance with newly-installed Guyanese President Irfaan Ali.  Pompeo is using his four-nation South America tour to ramp up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen a six-year economic collapse and has been indicted in the United States on narcoterrorism charges, to resign.  \u201cWe know that the Maduro regime has decimated the people of Venezuela and that Maduro himself is an indicted narcotics trafficker. That means he has to leave,\u201d Pompeo told reporters during his appearance in Georgetown with Ali.  Venezuela\u2019s information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Maduro, who accuses the United States of seeking to provoke a coup and seize control of the OPEC nation\u2019s vast oil reserves, remains in power despite the 18-month campaign of economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure led by Washington.  The latest salvo in a century-long border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela that is currently being evaluated at the International Court of Justice came in late 2018, when Venezuela\u2019s navy intercepted a vessel conducting a seismic survey on Exxon\u2019s behalf.  A series of offshore oil discoveries in recent years have given Guyana, which has no history of oil production, the potential to become one of Latin America\u2019s largest producers.  \u201cWe have had various difficulties and I think we welcome any help that would enhance our security, that would enhance our ability to protect our borders,\u201d Ali said.

FILE PHOTO: Darren Woods, Chairman & CEO of Exxon Mobil Corporation attends a news conference at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 1, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Wall Street investors are even starting to worry about the once-sacrosanct dividend at Exxon, which in the 20th Century became the world\u2019s most valuable company using global scale, relentless expansion and strict financial controls.  Exxon weathered a series of setbacks last decade and under Chief Executive Darren Woods sought to return to past prominence by big bets on U.S. shale oilfields, pipelines and global refining and plastics. It also bet big on offshore Guyana, where it discovered up to 8 billion barrels of oil, six years of production at its current rate.  But Exxon\u2019s ability to finance that global expansion is no longer assured. This year the company borrowed $23 billion to pay its bills, nearly doubling its outstanding debt. In July, it posted its first back-to-back quarterly losses ever. It faces a full-year $1.86 billion loss, according to Refinitiv, excluding asset sales or write downs.  The looming shortfall of about $48 billion through 2021 was calculated using cash from operations, commitments to shareholder payouts and costs for the massive expansion program Exxon had planned. Now the company is embarking on a worldwide review of where it can cut expenses, and analysts believe the once unthinkable dividend cut has grown more likely.  JOB REVIEWS, BENEFIT CUTS  This year\u2019s sharp drop in oil demand and pricing has shredded Woods\u2019 plan to spend at least $30 billion a year through 2025 to revive production and earnings by expanding in oil processing, chemicals and production, and by taking a commanding role in U.S. shale and liquefied natural gas, markets that then looked promising.  Instead, he must prepare Exxon to operate in a world of weaker demand for its oil, gas and plastics. The company has been dropped from the Dow Jones index of top U.S. industrial companies after 92 years. It is exposing up to 10% of U.S. staff to harsh reviews that could push thousands out of the company, and is taking away lavish retirement benefits that had career employees staying 30 years on average.  Exxon declined to make an executive available for an interview, and a spokesman said details of cost cuts would be disclosed early next year.  \u201cWe remain committed to our capital allocation priorities \u2013 investing in industry advantaged projects, paying a reliable and growing dividend, and maintaining a strong balance sheet,\u201d said spokesman Casey Norton.  A review of projects now underway aims to \u201cmaximize efficiency and capture additional cost savings to put us in the strongest position\u201d as energy markets improve, he said.  (For a graphic on cash from operations and asset sales, click here: )  Oil prices have dropped 35% from the start of 2020 as demand collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Repsol and others have cut billions of dollars off the value of their oil and gas properties, something Exxon has yet to do.  The European majors also are adding renewable energy and electricity to their portfolios, a hedge against permanently reduced oil and gas demand. BP plans by 2030 to reduce its fossil fuel production by 40%. It plans to sell even more fossil fuel properties if oil prices have a sustained rally.  DEBT NEARLY DOUBLES  Exxon\u2019s cash from operations - estimated to be about $17.4 billion this year - is $20 billion below the funds needed for this year\u2019s already pared investment plan and shareholder dividend, a Reuters analysis showed.  The company\u2019s stock price closed Friday at $39.08, off 56% since Woods became CEO. He raised $23.19 billion in new debt this year to bolster finances, but has vowed not to borrow more and as recently as July insisted the dividend was sacrosanct.  Investors say the commitments will be difficult to keep. \u201cAt $41 or $42 [per barrel] crude, you can\u2019t put those puzzle pieces together and have them make sense,\u201d said Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, which holds about $70 million in Exxon shares.  Exxon must cut its dividend if the share price remains depressed, Stoeckle said. \u201cSomething has to give. Wherever the give comes hurts management credibility,\u201d he said.  A cut would be \u201ccataclysmic\u201d for Exxon\u2019s stock, said equity analyst Paul Sankey of Sankey Research, given that executives in July reiterated its importance.  Exxon\u2019s weak cash flow worries investors that hold the stock for its nearly 9% dividend. Matrix Asset Advisors has it on a \u201cwatch list in terms of our conviction and their ability to defend and grow the dividend,\u201d said David Katz, chief investment officer at the New York firm.  SPENDING CUTS AND DEFERRALS  Exxon will slash spending in the Permian Basin shale field this year to about $3 billion from an original $7.4 billion budget, consultancy Rystad Energy estimates.  The company has said it plans to reduce the number of drilling rigs there to 15 or fewer, from 55 early this year, and the company\u2019s pullback \u201cwill continue,\u201d senior vice president Neil Chapman said in a July call. Spending on refining and chemicals plants that take years to design and complete, \u201cis really a question of deferral,\u201d he added.  A $10 billion chemical plant in China remains subject to permits, the Exxon spokesman said. Spending limits will further constrain its oil, refining and plastics businesses and could revive pressure on the company to divest some operations.  \u201cEach of our core businesses could be a powerhouse in its own right,\u201d Woods said when he rolled out the vision in early 2017. At the time, he was pushing back at calls to spin off businesses to boost lagging returns.  Woods stuck to the growth targets last year, putting this year\u2019s potential earnings at $25.1 billion with oil at $60 a barrel and assuming flat refining and chemical margins. That forecast included 2020 cash flow and asset sales targets that have become unreachable since the pandemic hit.  (For a graphic of Exxon's capital and exploration spending, go here: )  Analysts said that Woods must dial back. Project outlays next year could drop to between $10.4 billion and $15 billion, according to ScotiaBank and RBC Capital Markets, half the original outlook.  NO URGENCY FOR LNG  Some project schedules are being quietly stretched to save costs.  Construction at a $10 billion-plus LNG facility in Texas where Exxon holds a 30% stake already was moving slowly and now \u201cthere isn\u2019t the urgency,\u201d said Alex Munton, with consulting and data firm Wood Mackenzie. He expects its startup will be delayed a year, to 2025 at the earliest.  A massive LNG project in Mozambique likely will not get a final investment decision until 2023, as an expansion of Exxon LNG exports in Papua, New Guinea, is delayed by government talks and low LNG prices, Munton said.  \u201cThe reality is that Exxon is not moving forward with either of those in the near term,\u201d Munton said.  In Mexico, Exxon will likely reduce offshore activity after its first well was not commercial, according to people familiar with its operations. It will instead focus on fuel imports and retail sales, they said.  Exxon has begun exploration drilling in Brazil, where the company returned in 2017 to become second only to state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA in holdings of offshore exploration acreage. But \u201cspend and activity deferrals cannot be ruled out as part of any cost-cutting,\u201d said Ruaraidh Montgomery, director at Welligence Energy Analytics.  Other projects already begun, including the $1.9 billion expansion of its Beaumont, Texas, refinery, face an up to one year postponement.  Exxon declined to comment on the LNG, Mexico or Brazil spending.  Other than Guyana, \u201cthere will be no other sacred cow in the near-term budget,\u201d said analyst Paul Cheng of ScotiaBank.","342":"LONDON (Reuters) - Top U.S. and European oil and gas companies are forecast to swing into a second quarter loss after coronavirus lockdowns destroyed fuel demand, hit prices and squeezed margins, analysts said and Refinitiv Eikon data showed.

Theodore Wells, a lawyer for Exxon Mobil, leaves New York State Supreme Court in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 23, 2019. REUTERS\/Jefferson Siegel  The lawyers\u2019 opening statements kicked off a long-awaited trial in a civil lawsuit filed by the attorney general last year accusing Exxon of defrauding investors out of up to $1.6 billion.  The trial, expected to last up to three weeks, will take place before Justice Barry Ostrager in Manhattan Supreme Court without a jury and could feature testimony from Rex Tillerson, who served as Exxon chief executive officer and U.S. Secretary of State.  It is the first of several lawsuits currently pending against major oil companies related to climate change to go to trial.  The attorney general sued Exxon in October 2018 under the Martin Act, a New York state law that had been used primarily to go after financial fraud.  The lawsuit claimed Exxon falsely told investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business using a \u201cproxy cost\u201d of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions, but internally used figures as low as $40 per ton or none at all.  \u201cExxon only ever told its investors about a single set of assumptions,\u201d Kevin Wallace, acting chief of the New York Attorney General\u2019s Investor Protection Bureau, told Ostrager Tuesday.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  \u201cWhat we are saying, and the law demands, is that Exxon not mislead its investors,\u201d he said.  Theodore Wells, a lawyer for Exxon, said that after Tillerson became chief executive in 2006, the company put in place a \u201crobust system\u201d to manage the risk of increasing climate change.  He said the $80 per ton proxy cost represented a \u201cglobal,\u201d \u201cmacro level\u201d assessment of the cost, while lower figures, known as greenhouse gas or GHG costs, were used for particular capital projects.  \u201cThere is no document that says ... proxy costs and GHG costs were one and the same,\u201d he said.  Wells also accused former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman of bringing the case for political reasons.  \u201cThey didn\u2019t stay in their lane of objectivity and fairness,\u201d he said.  Massachusetts is separately investigating whether Exxon concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels play in climate change.  Both Massachusetts and New York began investigating Exxon after news reports in 2015 saying company scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.  Those reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.  Exxon and other oil companies including BP Plc BP.L, Chevron Corp CVX.N and Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.AS face lawsuits by cities and counties across the United States seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels brought on by climate change.","346":"HOUSTON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp signaled in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that higher oil and gas prices and improved chemicals margins would aid fourth quarter results, but the gains would be overshadowed by an up to $20 billion asset write down.

The talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement.  The field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects.  The volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 \u201cunitisation\u201d - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and France\u2019s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said.  The companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.  Across the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last year\u2019s record level of approvals for plants.  Success in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now don\u2019t expect until early 2022.  The FID on Total\u2019s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.  The current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.  It allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the \u201cstraddling\u201d reserves, with a 50\/50 share in phase one of development.  Now Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projects\u2019 annual LNG production, according to the sources.  \u201cThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,\u201d said one of the sources.  Asked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: \u201cAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.\u201d  \u201cExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,\u201d he added.  Total said the operators of the two projects \u201ccontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of development\u201d.  Mozambique\u2019s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reuters\u2019 questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nation\u2019s energy development.  The INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.  BOOSTING PRODUCTION  A Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxon\u2019s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.  Instead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.  This would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovuma\u2019s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.  Mozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.  Reuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.  A fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.  In April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.  The Mozambique government has said it expects Exxon\u2019s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.  In response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: \u201cWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.\u201d  Area 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNG\u2019s licence area.  SHADOW OF INSURGENCY  While Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.  It would mean the company wouldn\u2019t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.  However the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projects\u2019 doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.  Analysts warn the group\u2019s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.  One of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.  \u201cThe investment will not be viable without security,\u201d the official said.

The impairments made by the European majors also came after they lowered their long-term oil prices forecasts as they prepare to increasingly switch to renewable energy in the coming decades to reduce carbon emissions to net zero.  The revisions might nevertheless lead to a sharp rise in oil prices in the coming years as a result of lower investments in new projects, Clint said.  \u201cWe\u2019re staring into the abyss when it comes to supply and demand balances due to a dearth of much needed capital investment.\u201d","356":"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N shareholders soundly rejected climate-related proposals and splitting the chairman and chief executive's roles at the oil major's shareholder meeting on Wednesday.

Exxon\u2019s director slate was approved by an average of 93.6%, the company said in preliminary results.  Influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services this year recommended a vote against the independent chairman resolution.  That was enough to overcome support for the measure by Exxon\u2019s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock Inc, which said it voted in favor of an independent chairman and against the re-election of two directors over the company\u2019s approach to climate risks.

Exxon is also considering selling its assets in the British North Sea after more than 50 years, industry sources told Reuters last month.  The oil major has been focusing more in recent years to growing its onshore U.S. shale production, especially in the Permian basin, as well as developing large oil discoveries in Guyana.","360":"(Reuters) - Canada\u2019s Imperial Oil Ltd is grinding its rail shipments to a near halt and reviewing a multi-billion-dollar oil sands project, due to uncertainty caused by government-ordered production cuts, its chief executive officer said on Friday.  The Canadian province of Alberta ordered mandatory production cuts starting in January to ease an oil glut, lifting Canadian prices sharply. Alberta this week said it would now ease those curtailments slightly.  Integrated producers like Imperial, majority-owned by Exxon Mobil Corp, were hurt by rebounding Canadian prices last month because they weaken their refining margins.  CEO Rich Kruger said Imperial reduced rail shipments in January nearly in half, to 90,000 barrels per day, and plans volumes \u201cnear zero\u201d in February due to the curtailments\u2019 impact.  \u201cWith the stroke of a pen, the government picked winners and losers,\u201d he said on a quarterly conference call. \u201cThe incentive to move crude by rail has been erased. It\u2019s negative, uneconomic.\u201d  A discount of at least $15 per barrel on Canadian heavy oil compared with U.S. prices is needed to make rail economical, but the discount shrank last month to less than half that, Kruger said.  In December, Imperial dramatically increased rail shipments and intended to raise them further, he said.  The cuts were necessary for protecting jobs, said Mike McKinnon, spokesman for Alberta\u2019s energy minister. The government expects the differential between Canadian and U.S. prices to eventually settle into a more sustainable level, he said.  Imperial is scaling back rail shipments as demand for heavy crude from U.S. Gulf Coast refiners climbs with U.S. sanctions against Venezuela taking hold. Imperial has pipeline contracts to ship crude there.  \u201cIt reminds me of an old movie, Planes, Trains and Automobiles - any way we can get it there in the right market conditions makes sense,\u201d Kruger said.  Rail was an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d against full pipelines for Imperial\u2019s plans to build the 75,000 bpd Aspen oil sands project, but it is now re-evaluating its assumptions related to Aspen, Kruger said.  \u201cThe curtailment order, it\u2019s introduced new risk and new uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it short-term?

Earlier, Imperial posted a quarterly profit that beat analysts\u2019 estimates, as cheap crude enhanced margins at its refining division.

REUTERS\/Sergio Moraes\/File Photo  Oil Search\u2019s new Chief Executive Officer Keiran Wulff said he hoped negotiations could resume \u201cwithin weeks\u201d between its partner Exxon and the state.  The government ditched talks in January with Exxon on terms for developing the P\u2019nyang gas field to feed an expansion of Exxon\u2019s PNG liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, amid a push to reap more benefits from resources projects for the impoverished South Pacific nation.  Oil Search\u2019s veteran boss Peter Botten, who just retired as CEO but is still working for the company, is sounding out the government this week on what it would need to resume talks, Wulff said.  \u201cWe would hope to see some sort of formal negotiations recommence between Exxon and the state negotiating team within a reasonable period of time,\u201d Wulff told Reuters in an interview after the company released earnings earlier on Tuesday.  \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that it\u2019s weeks. We don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be months,\u201d he said.  Oil Search reported an 8% fall in annual net profit to $312.4 million, hit by weaker oil and LNG prices, missing analysts\u2019 forecasts of around $339 million, according to Refinitiv IBES estimates.  Oil Search\u2019s growth prospects are largely tied to a combined plan to develop P\u2019nyang and Papua LNG, led by France\u2019s Total SA, to feed three new processing units, called trains, at Exxon\u2019s PNG LNG plant.  All the partners want a three-train development, Oil Search said, as sharing infrastructure would be the most efficient way to develop P\u2019nyang and Papua LNG.  \u201cFor us we\u2019re strongly behind the operator to pursue a three-train development, which is as much in the joint venture\u2019s interest as it is in the state\u2019s,\u201d Wulff said.  He said they would only consider a two-train development without P\u2019nyang \u201cafter all options were exhausted\u201d.  Exxon Mobil had no immediate comment, but Chief Executive Darren Woods said earlier this month the company hoped to revive talks on P\u2019nyang to get to a \u201cwin-win proposition\u201d.  The coronavirus has dampened demand for LNG from China, but Oil Search said it expected that only to be a short term issue.  \u201cWe are confident in our ability to secure LNG offtake agreements once we resume discussions with potential Asian buyers, due to the attractiveness of LNG from PNG,\u201d Botten said in a statement.  If an agreement is reached on P\u2019nyang and early engineering work on a three-train development begins in 2020, Oil Search expects its capital spending this year will be in the range of $710 million to $845 million.","362":"HOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Ill-timed bets on rising demand have Exxon Mobil Corp facing a shortfall of about $48 billion through 2021, according to a Reuters tally and Wall Street estimates, a situation that will require the top U.S. oil company to make deep cuts to its staff and projects.  Wall Street investors are even starting to worry about the once-sacrosanct dividend at Exxon, which in the 20th Century became the world\u2019s most valuable company using global scale, relentless expansion and strict financial controls.  Exxon weathered a series of setbacks last decade and under Chief Executive Darren Woods sought to return to past prominence by big bets on U.S. shale oilfields, pipelines and global refining and plastics. It also bet big on offshore Guyana, where it discovered up to 8 billion barrels of oil, six years of production at its current rate.  But Exxon\u2019s ability to finance that global expansion is no longer assured. This year the company borrowed $23 billion to pay its bills, nearly doubling its outstanding debt. In July, it posted its first back-to-back quarterly losses ever. It faces a full-year $1.86 billion loss, according to Refinitiv, excluding asset sales or write downs.  The looming shortfall of about $48 billion through 2021 was calculated using cash from operations, commitments to shareholder payouts and costs for the massive expansion program Exxon had planned. Now the company is embarking on a worldwide review of where it can cut expenses, and analysts believe the once unthinkable dividend cut has grown more likely.  JOB REVIEWS, BENEFIT CUTS  This year\u2019s sharp drop in oil demand and pricing has shredded Woods\u2019 plan to spend at least $30 billion a year through 2025 to revive production and earnings by expanding in oil processing, chemicals and production, and by taking a commanding role in U.S. shale and liquefied natural gas, markets that then looked promising.  Instead, he must prepare Exxon to operate in a world of weaker demand for its oil, gas and plastics. The company has been dropped from the Dow Jones index of top U.S. industrial companies after 92 years. It is exposing up to 10% of U.S. staff to harsh reviews that could push thousands out of the company, and is taking away lavish retirement benefits that had career employees staying 30 years on average.  Exxon declined to make an executive available for an interview, and a spokesman said details of cost cuts would be disclosed early next year.  \u201cWe remain committed to our capital allocation priorities \u2013 investing in industry advantaged projects, paying a reliable and growing dividend, and maintaining a strong balance sheet,\u201d said spokesman Casey Norton.  A review of projects now underway aims to \u201cmaximize efficiency and capture additional cost savings to put us in the strongest position\u201d as energy markets improve, he said.  (For a graphic on cash from operations and asset sales, click here: )  Oil prices have dropped 35% from the start of 2020 as demand collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Repsol and others have cut billions of dollars off the value of their oil and gas properties, something Exxon has yet to do.  The European majors also are adding renewable energy and electricity to their portfolios, a hedge against permanently reduced oil and gas demand. BP plans by 2030 to reduce its fossil fuel production by 40%. It plans to sell even more fossil fuel properties if oil prices have a sustained rally.  DEBT NEARLY DOUBLES  Exxon\u2019s cash from operations - estimated to be about $17.4 billion this year - is $20 billion below the funds needed for this year\u2019s already pared investment plan and shareholder dividend, a Reuters analysis showed.  The company\u2019s stock price closed Friday at $39.08, off 56% since Woods became CEO. He raised $23.19 billion in new debt this year to bolster finances, but has vowed not to borrow more and as recently as July insisted the dividend was sacrosanct.  Investors say the commitments will be difficult to keep. \u201cAt $41 or $42 [per barrel] crude, you can\u2019t put those puzzle pieces together and have them make sense,\u201d said Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, which holds about $70 million in Exxon shares.  Exxon must cut its dividend if the share price remains depressed, Stoeckle said. \u201cSomething has to give. Wherever the give comes hurts management credibility,\u201d he said.  A cut would be \u201ccataclysmic\u201d for Exxon\u2019s stock, said equity analyst Paul Sankey of Sankey Research, given that executives in July reiterated its importance.  Exxon\u2019s weak cash flow worries investors that hold the stock for its nearly 9% dividend. Matrix Asset Advisors has it on a \u201cwatch list in terms of our conviction and their ability to defend and grow the dividend,\u201d said David Katz, chief investment officer at the New York firm.  SPENDING CUTS AND DEFERRALS  Exxon will slash spending in the Permian Basin shale field this year to about $3 billion from an original $7.4 billion budget, consultancy Rystad Energy estimates.  The company has said it plans to reduce the number of drilling rigs there to 15 or fewer, from 55 early this year, and the company\u2019s pullback \u201cwill continue,\u201d senior vice president Neil Chapman said in a July call. Spending on refining and chemicals plants that take years to design and complete, \u201cis really a question of deferral,\u201d he added.  A $10 billion chemical plant in China remains subject to permits, the Exxon spokesman said. Spending limits will further constrain its oil, refining and plastics businesses and could revive pressure on the company to divest some operations.  \u201cEach of our core businesses could be a powerhouse in its own right,\u201d Woods said when he rolled out the vision in early 2017. At the time, he was pushing back at calls to spin off businesses to boost lagging returns.  Woods stuck to the growth targets last year, putting this year\u2019s potential earnings at $25.1 billion with oil at $60 a barrel and assuming flat refining and chemical margins. That forecast included 2020 cash flow and asset sales targets that have become unreachable since the pandemic hit.  (For a graphic of Exxon's capital and exploration spending, go here: )  Analysts said that Woods must dial back. Project outlays next year could drop to between $10.4 billion and $15 billion, according to ScotiaBank and RBC Capital Markets, half the original outlook.  NO URGENCY FOR LNG  Some project schedules are being quietly stretched to save costs.  Construction at a $10 billion-plus LNG facility in Texas where Exxon holds a 30% stake already was moving slowly and now \u201cthere isn\u2019t the urgency,\u201d said Alex Munton, with consulting and data firm Wood Mackenzie. He expects its startup will be delayed a year, to 2025 at the earliest.  A massive LNG project in Mozambique likely will not get a final investment decision until 2023, as an expansion of Exxon LNG exports in Papua, New Guinea, is delayed by government talks and low LNG prices, Munton said.  \u201cThe reality is that Exxon is not moving forward with either of those in the near term,\u201d Munton said.  In Mexico, Exxon will likely reduce offshore activity after its first well was not commercial, according to people familiar with its operations. It will instead focus on fuel imports and retail sales, they said.  Exxon has begun exploration drilling in Brazil, where the company returned in 2017 to become second only to state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA in holdings of offshore exploration acreage. But \u201cspend and activity deferrals cannot be ruled out as part of any cost-cutting,\u201d said Ruaraidh Montgomery, director at Welligence Energy Analytics.  Other projects already begun, including the $1.9 billion expansion of its Beaumont, Texas, refinery, face an up to one year postponement.  Exxon declined to comment on the LNG, Mexico or Brazil spending.  Other than Guyana, \u201cthere will be no other sacred cow in the near-term budget,\u201d said analyst Paul Cheng of ScotiaBank.","363":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Harris County, Texas sued Exxon Mobil Corp on Thursday over pollution from a fire a day earlier at the company\u2019s Baytown Olefins Plant, according to an attorney for the county.  FILE PHOTO: Smoke rises from a fire at Exxon Mobil's refining and chemical plant complex in Baytown, near Houston, Texas, U.S. July 31, 2019. REUTERS\/Erwin Seba  The fire was being investigated by federal and state agencies. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) were at the scene to determine the cause of a blaze that raged for hours and raised a column of black smoke over the area.  The U.S. Chemical Safety Board, which is authorized to probe industrial chemical accidents, will not investigate the Baytown Olefins Plant fire, said spokeswoman Hillary Cohen in a statement.  The suit by Harris County, which includes Baytown, is the second lawsuit this year against the company involving fires at the plant.  The suit seeks court orders to prevent future fires at the Baytown plant, said Rock Owens, managing attorney for the environmental practice in the Harris County Attorney\u2019s Office.  \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to me for a company to have these kinds of problems with the potential for some kind of disaster,\u201d he said.  He said Harris County also is also asking the state court to order an investigation to determine the root cause of the fire in a propylene recovery unit. The county is seeking similar orders in connection with a lawsuit filed in March over a hydrotreater fire in the Baytown refinery.  Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said the company is reviewing the lawsuit.  Exxon\u2019s giant Baytown refining and petrochemical complex accounts for about 9% of total U.S. polypropylene, according to analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Polypropylene is a component in plastics.  In a statement on Thursday, Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Nordin said the fire has been extinguished and all employees affected by the fire were cleared to return to work. The company has not said what triggered the blaze.  Because of the fire, production at Exxon\u2019s 560,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) Baytown refinery remains cut back, the company confirmed. It did not say by how much production was affected.  Jason Duncan, manager of the Baytown Olefins Plant, said on Wednesday afternoon that 37 workers were treated for minor injuries including burns. Later, Exxon said a total of 66 workers had been examined at a clinic for possible injuries but not all were treated.  Officials ordered Baytown residents to remain indoors on Wednesday with their air conditioning turned off for about four hours after an explosion set off the fire.","364":"LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s biggest asset manager has removed ExxonMobil and four more companies from its 5 billion pounds ($6.3 billion) Future World Funds, and said it would vote against their chairs for failing to confront the threats posed by climate change.  Legal & General Investment Management, the fund arm of insurer Legal & General, with 1 trillion pounds under management, has been among the most vocal asset managers on climate risks, and will also divest from Hormel Foods, Korea Electric Power Corporation, Kroger and Metlife.  The divestment only applies to LGIMs Future World Funds which it says are set up for clients who want to express a conviction on environmental, social and governance (ESG) themes.  \u201cIn all other LGIM (non-Future World) funds that remain invested in those companies that have not met our criteria, we will vote against the election of the chair of the board,\u201d said Meryam Omi, Head of Sustainability and Responsible Investment Strategy, LGIM.  \u201cWe can vote against the chair on any number of issues, so to do so because of a single issue such as climate change sends a powerful message to companies that they should be raising their standards in this area,\u201d she said.  As part of its Climate Impact Pledge, launched in 2016, LGIM has sought to engage with the largest companies in the oil and gas, mining, electric utilities, autos, food retail and financial sectors on climate change and said it would take action.  \u201cExxonMobil Corporation has not met our key minimum requirements, including on emissions reporting and targets,\u201d LGIM said in its report.  LGIM said meeting the 2015 Paris climate agreement goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius would mean cutting fossil fuel use by a third by 2040.  Some institutional investors have pressed Exxon to define a path toward meeting the Paris agreement, but the company has not committed to any targets.  Last month shareholders defeated measures calling for a special board committee on climate change and for a report on the climate risks.  LGIM said Exxon lags behind European peers such as Equinor, BP and Shell which better disclose their company\u2019s potential climate risks.  Exxon was not immediately available for comment.  Hormel Foods, Korea Electric Power Corporation, U.S. retailer Kroger and U.S. insurance company Metlife also failed to meet LGIM\u2019s criteria on climate related risk disclosure, it said.

Exxon expects to add a crude distillation unit (CDU) at its 362,300 barrel per day (bpd) Beaumont refinery and boost refining capacity at plants in Baytown, Texas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Senior Vice President Jack Williams said in a presentation to Wall Street analysts last week.  \u201cIt\u2019s really a full Gulf Coast upgrade,\u201d Williams said, according to a transcript of the meeting confirmed on Monday by Exxon. The project has been under consideration for several years because of the increase in output from Texas and North Dakota shale fields. \u201cWe know this is going to be a long-term resource,\u201d he said.  Sources familiar with Exxon\u2019s plans told Reuters in February that the company was near a final investment decision for a project to expand crude oil processing capacity at the Beaumont refinery to as much as 850,000 bpd.  Williams said the project would increase the integration of Exxon\u2019s Gulf Coast operations by supplying its Baton Rouge and Baytown refineries with products made at Beaumont, reducing third-party purchases. He called the plan \u201cperhaps my favorite example on integration\u201d because it couples production and refining across business groups.  Exxon plans to invest $9 billion in six refinery projects globally in the next eight years and forecasts returns from its downstream to grow by 20 percent on average, the company said.  The expansion would offer a new outlet for the rising shale oil production from the Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico, which is expected to overwhelm U.S. refining capacity in the next few years, said an analyst from energy consultancy IHS Markit.  \u201cThere will still be a sizable surplus of lightweight crude,\u201d said Rob Smith, director of IHS Markit\u2019s oil markets and downstream group.

The discussions, which are no longer active, are indicative of the pressure the energy sector\u2019s most dominant companies faced as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold and crude prices plunged.  The talks between Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods and Chevron CEO Mike Wirth were serious enough for legal documents involving certain aspects of the merger discussions to be drafted, one of the sources said. The reason the talks ended could not be learned.  The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Chevron, which have market capitalizations of $190 billion and $164 billion, respectively, declined to comment.  Exxon and Chevron\u2019s shares nosedived last year after a Saudi-Russian price war and fallout from the novel coronavirus outbreak caused the value of oil to crater. Exxon\u2019s stock was hit hardest, as investors raised concerns about the company\u2019s long-term profitability and spending decisions.  In their talks, the CEOs of Exxon and Chevron envisioned achieving synergies through massive cost cuts to help weather the downturn in energy markets, one of the sources said. At the end of 2019, Exxon employed about 75,000 people and Chevron roughly 48,000.  Following the aborted talks with Exxon, Chevron went on to acquire oil producer Noble Energy in a $5 billion cash-and-stock deal that was completed in October.  A proposed combination last year would almost certainly have triggered an intense antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department, a process that typically takes months to complete. And such a review would also potentially have run up against last November\u2019s U.S. presidential election, raising additional uncertainty about how soon such a deal might be cleared, if at all.  Now, under the Biden administration, the window might be all but closed as Democrats historically have been less sympathetic to such deals, one of the sources said. President Joe Biden has put climate change at the forefront of his agenda, promoting jobs in renewable energy as opposed to traditional ones in the oil sector.

General Motors last week said it would aim to stop selling vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel, which rely on oil, by 2035.  The White House and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  News of the unsuccessful talks emerged as Exxon has come under pressure from some of its shareholders over its strategic direction.  Engine No. 1, a investment firm based in San Francisco, last week nominated four directors to Exxon\u2019s board and is pushing the company to spend its cash better, preserve its dividend, and invest more in clean energy. Exxon is also in the crosshairs of hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which is pressuring the company to cut costs and improve performance.  Exxon reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. Chevron last week reported a surprise $11 million fourth-quarter loss as low margins on fuel, acquisition costs and foreign currency effects overwhelmed improved drilling results.  COMBINED GIANT  A combined Exxon-Chevron would be eclipsed in size only by Saudi Aramco, which boasts a roughly $1.8 trillion market value and has previously pushed many U.S. drillers to the financial brink by flooding the market with oil.  Despite inevitable antitrust concerns, the companies could argue a merger would represent the United States\u2019 best shot at taking on the Saudi state-owned conglomerate and the world\u2019s other largest state-backed oil producers, one of the sources said.  Last year\u2019s Saudi-Russian oil price war, for instance, highlighted the vulnerability of U.S. producers to foreign governments that can effectively dictate the price of crude by forcing energy companies they back to boost or cut output.  U.S. oil companies each compete among one another and set their own varying production targets, with limited ability of Washington to intervene.  Exxon and Chevron, with their powerful balance sheets, withstood turmoil in energy markets following the pandemic that forced some smaller independent oil and gas producers to file for bankruptcy protection.  Yet they also felt the pain. Demand for oil evaporated in early 2020 as governments imposed travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders to slow the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s spread.  At one point in April, the price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures turned negative for the first time ever, signifying sellers needed to pay buyers to take the commodity off their hands. Prices have since rebounded to roughly $52 a barrel.  Exxon and Chevron have both cut jobs over the past year. Exxon late last year left its dividend flat after boosting the shareholder payout each year since 1982.","379":"April 2 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is not required to let its shareholders vote on setting greenhouse gas targets, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Tuesday, agreeing with the company\u2019s request to reject the proposal.

FILE PHOTO - A logo is pictured at French oil and gas company Total gas station in Marseille, February 11, 2015. REUTERS\/Jean-Paul Pelissier  The LNG expansion, which analysts estimate will cost $13 billion, is crucial to the Pacific island nation\u2019s economy as LNG is its biggest export earner, while demand for the fuel is surging in international energy markets.  Prime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill said in the country\u2019s capital of Port Moresby on Friday that \u201cphysical terms\u201d had been agreed. He said negotiations over how revenue would be shared in the community and provincial governments required more work.  \u201cI\u2019d say we are almost 50 to 60 percent through already about our understanding of revenue sharing,\u201d O\u2019Neill said, in response to questions from Reuters.  Disagreements over land-owner rights and revenue-sharing agreements have been an almost constant feature of resource development in PNG.  A non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed on Friday is basically a commitment by the government to finalise a gas agreement in early 2019, which would lead to the development of Papua LNG, run by Total.  The signing was held on the sidelines of the PNG-hosted Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, where Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said he hoped to make progress on the agreement quickly.  \u201cThere is still some work to be done, but we are ambitious and I\u2019d love to come back not in two years but in 10 months or before,\u201d Pouyanne said.  Papua LNG will supply gas from the Elk-Antelope fields for two new processing units, called trains, at Exxon Mobil\u2019s PNG LNG plant.  At the same time, Exxon Mobil plans to develop gas at the P\u2019nyang field to help fill a third new train at the plant. All together the projects will double the plant\u2019s output to around 16 million tonnes a year.  Exxon said in an emailed comment that it was pleased to see progress on the Papua LNG talks.  Oil Search, a partner in both Papua LNG and PNG LNG, said all parties were \u201caligned on the need to ensure that new LNG developments in PNG remain competitive with other new LNG projects worldwide\u201d.  The companies are racing to start exporting from the new trains by 2024, when the LNG market is expected to need new supply to meet rapidly growing demand in Asia. But analysts say that timeline might be hard to meet as a final investment decision may not come until 2020 or 2021.  \u201cUltimately the timeline for Papua will be dictated by Exxon\u2019s patient and disciplined centralised decision making process, and all other parties will just need to fall in line with that,\u201d said Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic.

Others have not yet confirmed commercial finds. Tullow has made several discoveries in the past year, but the company has yet to find enough reserves to make the project work.  In a Monday night Facebook post in response to this story, Ali said the terms of the other deals must be renegotiated because they are \u201ceven more lopsided\u201d than Exxon\u2019s contract. But he said the administration of the Exxon contract should be improved, and that the company should use more Guyanese goods and services.  \u201cAs such we will review that contract to ensure that the administration of the contract brings greater benefit to Guyana,\u201d he wrote.  Granger\u2019s government has defended its deal with Exxon, which includes a 2% royalty and a 50% profit share after the company recoups its costs, noting that attractive terms were needed to secure investment in a risky new location.  That will bring Guyana around $230 million in government revenue in 2020 and nearly $2 billion total by 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a substantial boost for an underdeveloped country of less than 800,000 people whose central government spent just $1.2 billion in 2018.  Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said \u201cthe negotiated terms of the contracts are competitive with other agreements signed in countries at a similar resource development phase.\u201d A Tullow spokesman declined to comment. Repsol and Total did not respond to requests for comment.  Ali, a former housing minister, said it would be premature to say which parts of the other contracts need changing.

Reports of Exxon\u2019s exit plans first emerged last year, but neither the company nor the Romanian government would officially confirm them.  Earlier this week, Romanian Prime Minister Ludovic Orban said state gas producer Romgaz would be interested in joining a consortium alongside OMV Petrom and a third company to develop Neptun Deep. He also said Russia\u2019s Lukoil had requested information about the sale.  \u201cShould Exxon decide to sell, we want a serious partner, one that comes from the region of our partnerships, the European Union, NATO,\u201d Orban told private television station Digi24.  \u201cWe can\u2019t decide for Exxon to whom it will sell its participation, but there are other offers.\u201d  A sale of Exxon\u2019s stake, which requires Romanian government approval, would help edge the oil producer toward its goal of raising $15 billion in proceeds from asset sales by 2021.  In November, people familiar with the matter estimated Exxon\u2019s stake in Neptun Deep could be worth about $250 million.  The company has stepped up a divestment campaign to offset heavy spending in U.S. shale, refining and chemicals, and deep water oil exploration in Guyana and Brazil. Exxon recently sold Norwegian assets to Var Energi AS, a majority owned unit of Italy\u2019s ENI SpA. That sale is expected to provide up to $3.6 billion in cash during the latest quarter.  Several gas producers have spent about a decade and billions of dollars preparing to tap Romania\u2019s Black Sea gas, but they were blindsided by price caps, taxes and export restrictions pushed forward by the previous Social Democrat government.

The company\u2019s stock was removed from the storied Dow Jones Industrial Average after nearly a century of membership, and it is facing questions about whether it can maintain its dividend.

Graphic: Exxon Mobil's total debt soars","398":"Oct 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp was once the largest U.S. publicly traded company in the United States. Now, the oil major is not even the largest energy name, having been surpassed by rivals and even a renewable company, as it tries to maintain its hefty dividend.  It has been an ignominious year for Exxon. It is expected to report a record-setting third straight quarterly loss on Friday as the COVID-19 pandemic crushes demand globally for crude oil and fuel.  Shares are at a two-decade low, down 55% this year. The company\u2019s stock was removed from the storied Dow Jones Industrial Average after nearly a century of membership, and it is facing questions about whether it can maintain its dividend.  Exxon cut employees and project spending, but has stuck by plans to continue paying a dividend that costs nearly $15 billion per year.  Exxon currently has a massive dividend yield of 10%, in large part due to the share price slump. Cutting the dividend would \u201cupset the apple cart pretty significantly\u201d with many investors, said Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, which holds about $46 million in Exxon shares.  The company\u2019s cash balance could be depleted if U.S. oil remains below $45 a barrel due to its debt.  Exxon could sell assets to maintain the dividend, an unappetizing thought for many analysts.  \u201cThe last thing Exxon should be doing is putting itself in a position where it is forced to sell assets purely for the purpose of finding extra cash to pay the dividend,\u201d said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov.  Prior to the pandemic, Chief Executive Darren Woods spent heavily to boost output and turn around sagging profits on a bet on growing demand. It placed big bets on U.S. shale oilfields, global refining, plastics and offshore Guyana, where it struck one of the decade\u2019s biggest oil discoveries.  This year, the company cut capital spending plans by $10 billion to around $23 billion. Its debt has risen by 60% since Woods took over in 2017.  Exxon was once the nation\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company by market capitalization. But in a sign of the changing times, NextEra Energy Inc, the world\u2019s largest producer of wind and solar energy, has surpassed Exxon\u2019s market value, making it the most valuable U.S. energy company.  Exxon at times has also seen its market value drop below rival Chevron Corp.","399":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Exxon Mobil Corporation is shown on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, December 30, 2015.\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Wall Street analysts on Monday gave little credence to the possibility of an Exxon-Chevron mega merger, as news of talks last year between the two largest U.S. oil companies leaked ahead of Exxon\u2019s results that are expected to show the company posting its first-ever annual loss.  Shares in both the companies were down in early trading in New York, despite a rising overall market and weekend gains in global crude prices.  \u201cAt the depths of the market last year... a cost cutting focused merger of the two companies may have made sense and also scale matters in this industry so it would have created by far the largest integrated oil company,\u201d said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors.  However, anti-trust concerns and the new U.S. administration\u2019s stance on big mergers make it unlikely that a deal resurfaces, Kapadia said, adding that buying smaller, hard-hit oil companies gives Exxon and Chevron more value.  As oil producers in Europe adapt to investors\u2019 push for a shift into renewables, it is also possible that Chevron or Exxon could buy the oil producing business of a European major in the coming years, Kapadia said.  Exxon\u2019s year-end results scheduled for Tuesday are expected to be marred by a charge of up to $20 billion on the value of its natural gas properties.  The collapse in oil prices last April briefly pushed crude into negative territory and created a survival crisis for large parts of the U.S. industry.  \u201cGiven the precipitous drop (last year)... it is not surprising that XOM and CVX had a discussion about merging,\u201d said Mark Stoeckle, CEO of Baltimore-based Adams Funds.  \u201cThe sharp snapback in prices likely cooled both companies. There would no doubt be significant cost synergies to be had, but the antitrust issues in a Biden administration would probably be too much to overcome.\u201d","400":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * Futures up: Dow 0.55%, S&P 0.56%, Nasdaq 0.97%  March 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Tuesday at the end of one of Wall Street\u2019s worst first quarters on record, as an unexpected expansion in Chinese factory activity raised hopes of a more stable economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.

(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder)","406":"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)  HOUSTON, March 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp\u2019s $200 million write-down last month on abandoned ventures in Russia - once its next big frontier - points to challenges facing Chief Executive Darren Woods in his second year leading the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil producer.  Some of the biggest bets taken by his predecessor Rex Tillerson, now the U.S. secretary of state, have resulted in billions of dollars in write-downs amid falling production and a stock price that has long lagged peers.  That leaves Woods facing the prospect of slow growth and billions of dollars in new spending that could weigh on results for years. In 2018, the company plans capital spending of about $24 billion - up about a quarter since 2016 - suggesting return on capital will get worse before it gets better as the firm waits for a payoff from new exploration under Woods.  Rivals including Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron , by contrast, have capped or cut their spending after finishing expansion projects. Exxon shares are down 18 percent since Woods took over in January 2017. Shell is up 2 percent and Chevron is down about 3 percent during the same period.  Woods is feeling the heat from investors who could have made more if they held shares in Exxon\u2019s rivals, as well as activist investors who want to see the company take renewable energy more seriously. Analysts are pushing for more transparency on operations, and some have called for Woods to sell assets.  Exxon declined to comment. A State Department spokesperson said Tillerson would have no comment on Exxon matters and referred questions to the company.  Exxon is set to host its annual analyst meeting in New York on Wednesday.  The firm took the $200 million after-tax charge to walk away from its Russia Kara and Black sea ventures with Rosneft . Five years ago, Exxon touted plans to spend more than $3 billion in Russia, but the firm halted operations in late 2014 when the U.S. sanctioned the country over its military operations in Ukraine.  Exxon also took $1.3 billion in charges against Tillerson\u2019s bets on natural gas in Mexico and Canada this year. Last year, it took a $2.13 billion write-down a year earlier - mostly on Rocky Mountain properties tied to Tillerson\u2019s 2010 purchase of natural gas producer XTO Energy Inc. - and disclosed it had reduced estimates of Canadian oil reserves by 3.5 billion barrels.  \u201cThere\u2019s no question that, over the past handful of years, Exxon has been a relative underperformer,\u201d said Hank Smith, co-chief investment officer of the Haverford Trust, which has held Exxon\u2019s shares for two decades and recently added Royal Dutch Shell to its portfolio. \u201cIt\u2019s been frustrating.\u201d  \u2018EPIC FAIL\u2019  Weak results from production have this year cost Exxon its standing as the oil major generating the most cash, a distinction that now goes to Shell.  Now, Exxon is spending more cash on projects that will take time to produce.  In Guyana, where the company is leading development of an offshore field estimated to hold at least 3.2 billion barrels of oil, Exxon and partners have said they must spend more than $4 billion on developing a project not expected to deliver oil until at least late 2019.  More spending awaits Exxon in Qatar, Mozambique and Papua New Guinea for liquefied natural gas projects, and for oil developments in Brazil, Ghana and Mauritania, the company has said.  Exxon paid more than $6 billion last year to double its acreage in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield. Exxon\u2019s production there so far is relatively low compared to peers, about 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Exxon says it plans to triple output there through 2025.  With all Woods\u2019 development plans, it seems unlikely Exxon\u2019s capital spending will decline after this year, said Simmons & Co analyst Guy Baber.  The company did reverse some of the write-downs it took on reserves as oil prices rose. But the company\u2019s inability to translate those gains into robust profits in the final quarter of 2017 was an \u201cepic fail,\u201d said Raymond James oil analyst Pavel Molchanov.  LITTLE DATA FOR INVESTORS  Some investors say it\u2019s too soon to evaluate Woods\u2019 tenure despite Exxon\u2019s lagging returns.  \u201cThere are few decisions that any one person, let alone Woods, could make in the first 12 to 13 months that would be able to really affect the company,\u201d said Mark Stoeckle, portfolio manager of Adams Natural Resources Fund Inc, which holds Exxon\u2019s shares.  Exxon retains supporters on Wall Street. Its shares are recommended for purchase by 29 percent of the 24 analysts that cover the company, according to Thomson Reuters data. Half rate the shares as a \u201chold\u201d and five advise \u201csell.\u201d  Analysts recommending the stock cite the strength of Exxon\u2019s assets.  Others, however, want more information on Exxon\u2019s operations. Of the world\u2019s five largest publicly traded oil producers, Exxon ranks last for providing detailed data to investors, while BP Plc is the best, according to an analysis of quarterly earnings regulatory filings by investment researcher Redburn Ltd.  BP and Shell, for example, offer more than twice as much data as Exxon on each segment of operations, Redburn found.  \u201cExxon Mobil\u2019s greatest challenge for 2018 might not its valuation, assets or growth, but opening up to investors,\u201d said Redburn oil and gas analyst Rob West.","407":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: A sign for Santos Ltd is displayed on the front of the company's office building in the rural township of Gunnedah, located in north-western New South Wales in Australia, March 9, 2018.

The deal helps smooth the way for the planned expansion of PNG LNG, roughly aligning Santos\u2019 13.5% stake in the LNG project and the new gas field.  \u201cThe arrangements we announce today mark an important step toward the proposed expansion at the PNG LNG plant via a 2.7 metric tonnes per annum third LNG train fed by existing Project resources and P\u2019nyang,\u201d said Santos\u2019 Chief Executive Kevin Gallagher.  Oil Search said it would receive roughly $21.6 million for relinquishing a 1.65% stake in P\u2019nyang to Santos, bringing its holding to 36.86%. Exxon will hold a similar stake in the venture after the deal, having relinquished about 12.1% of its stake to Santos.  Santos\u2019 shares rose as much as 2% to a two-week high after the announcement, in a slightly stronger broader market.  POLITICAL RUCTIONS  The P\u2019nyang partners are waiting to seal an agreement with the government for development of the field, but the signing has been delayed amid political ructions in Papua New Guinea.  The government of Prime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill faces a possible vote of no-confidence later this month.  Adding to the pressure a watchdog - in findings O\u2019Neill disputes - said the PM acted improperly when arranging for the South Pacific nation to borrow A$1.2 billion ($830 million) from Swiss bank UBS in 2014.  The Ombudsman Commission said in a December report leaked this week that O\u2019Neill failed to follow correct legal procedures and bypassed parliament in deciding to borrow the money, used to buy shares in oil and gas producer Oil Search Ltd.  \u201cThe leak of the document is clearly political by some in the opposition playing a very dirty game in a desperate attempt to gain support for a change of government,\u201d O\u2019Neill said in a press release late on Wednesday.  PNG\u2019s opposition is maneuvering to call a vote of no confidence after a string of high-profile defections from O\u2019Neill\u2019s government, including finance minister James Marape.  Marape told Papua New Guinea\u2019s National newspaper on Wednesday that he quit because April\u2019s Papua LNG gas agreement with France\u2019s Total and its partners gave too much ground to the majors.","409":"PORT MORESBY (Reuters) - From her red-roofed home near Papua New Guinea\u2019s capital of Port Moresby, Isabelle Dikana Iveiri overlooks a giant plant used by Exxon Mobil Corp to liquefy billions of dollars\u2019 worth of natural gas before it is shipped to Asian buyers.

REUTERS\/David Gray  Dikana Iveiri can also see swaths of muddy shoreline, where mangroves have been felled for firewood by locals who don\u2019t have electricity, gas, or money to buy either.  The $19 billion Exxon-led PNG LNG project was supposed to be a game-changer for PNG, a vast South Pacific archipelago beset by poverty despite its wealth of natural resources.  But much of the promised riches, through taxes to the government, royalties to landowners and development levies to communities, have arrived well below Exxon\u2019s own commissioned forecasts, if at all, according to landowners, the World Bank and the PNG government.  \u201cMy family has been here a long time,\u201d said Dikana Iveiri, one of several landowners interviewed by Reuters near the PNG LNG plant. \u201cOur royalties are not going well; they are using our land but not paying us properly,\u201d she said referring to both Exxon, which pays the royalties and the government, which distributes them.  Since gas exports began more than four years ago, Dikana Iveiri said she had received just one royalty payment in 2017. She was expecting about 10,000 kina ($2,885) based on information given to her by the government and community leaders. She said she received 600 kina.  Exxon, community leaders and the government did not comment on Dikana Iveiri\u2019s specific situation but in a statement to Reuters, Exxon said distribution of royalties and benefits to the LNG plant site landowners started in 2017. Cash payments to individual landowners would depend on how many landowners were in a precinct and were just one of the benefits communities received, Exxon said.  The project employs nearly 2,600 workers, 82 percent of whom are Papua New Guinean and Exxon said it has invested $360 million to build infrastructure and pay for training and social programs.  \u201cWe could not be more pleased to see how the benefits are flowing to the communities at the LNG plant site, to see how investments are being made in important infrastructure such as schools and health that demonstrates the process is a good one and it works,\u201d ExxonMobil PNG Managing Director Andrew Barry told a mining and energy conference in Sydney in December.  Barry said Exxon was hoping royalties would begin flowing in the pipeline and upstream areas \u201cin the not too distant future\u201d.  The government admits it has made mistakes.  PNG Prime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill, who was part of the government but not the leader in 2009, said many of the disputes around PNG LNG stemmed from the way the government and Exxon proceeded with the project without first resolving landowner claims.  \u201cIt should have been done before, it wasn\u2019t only for Exxon and the partners but even the government at the time did not do the proper clan vetting, proper identification of the land owners - they allowed this project to go on without that,\u201d O\u2019Neill told Reuters.  Treasury, the treasurer, and the Prime Minister\u2019s spokesman declined to provide responses to Reuters\u2019 questions about the project.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  (GRAPHIC: ExxonMobil's LNG facilities - tmsnrt.rs\/2QhGSAz)  GAS-POWERED MONEY SPINNER  PNG LNG was completed ahead of schedule and exported 8.3 million metric tonnes in 2017, compared to its anticipated design capacity of 6.9 million tonnes, according to the project\u2019s website.  Exxon does not disclose the project\u2019s revenue or profits but research house Morningstar estimates it has generated $18.8 billion in revenue for Exxon and its partners since production started in 2014.  The project\u2019s break-even price of around $7.40 per million British Thermal Units (mBTU) compares favorably to an average over $10\/mBTU for eight recent gas projects in the region, according to analysis by consultancy Wood Mackenzie and Credit Suisse.  \u201cThe plant capacity has performed phenomenally,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic told Reuters. \u201cOn cost, it\u2019s much lower than peers ... it\u2019s got an ample resource base and it\u2019s got a well-disciplined operator in the form of Exxon.\u201d  The project\u2019s contribution to Papua New Guinea\u2019s economy and government finances is less clear.  PNG\u2019s Treasury does not report project income figures, but government budget papers show tax revenue flowing from PNG LNG has been well below expectations.  In its 2012 budget, the PNG government estimated it would receive $22 billion in revenue over the project\u2019s life to 2040.  In November, the government slashed its revenue forecast in half to $11 billion over the life of the project.  It identified 11 tax concessions, which along with a drop in gas prices, amounted to hundreds of millions in kina in annual revenue forgone.  A 2017 World Bank analysis found the project partners had negotiated favorable methods of calculating royalties to the government that allowed them to take various deductions.  Combined with tax concessions, the project created \u201ca complex web of exemptions and allowances that effectively mean that little revenue is received by government and landowners,\u201d the World Bank said.  Exxon did not respond to questions regarding the World Bank findings and the World Bank declined to provide further comment.  Exxon\u2019s partners, which include Australian-listed Oil Search Ltd and Santos Ltd, and a subsidiary of Japan\u2019s JXTG Holdings Inc, referred Reuters\u2019 questions to Exxon.  Exxon said in a statement to Reuters the project has generated 5 billion kina in revenue for the government and landowners via taxes, royalty and benefit payments. The figure includes revenue to the PNG state-owned stakeholders.  \u201cSOME MISTAKES\u201d  A second LNG project, Papua LNG, led by France\u2019s Total with Exxon and Oil Search as minority partners, is scheduled to finalize an agreement with the PNG government in early 2019.  Papua LNG, a new gasfield using the same but expanded processing plant, could commence production as soon as 2024, according to Total. Analysts estimate it will cost around $13 billion.  \u201cThe experience of the first project developed by Exxon and Oil Search, there was some criticism, some mistakes,\u201d Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne told Reuters in an interview in Port Moresby, referring to relations with landowners.  \u201cSome lessons (are) being taken out \u2026 around the management of landowners and trying to engage at an early stage with them.\u201d  Total has agreed to an undisclosed annual minimum payment to the government and to reserve some gas for local industry, he said.  Exxon did not respond to requests for comment on Pouyanne\u2019s statements.  In its statement, Exxon acknowledged that \u201cdistribution of royalties and benefits in some project areas were delayed since the start of production due to court action by a small number of landowners which prevented the relevant government departments from completing their administrative processes.\u201d  Exxon said it was committed to assisting the government ensure landowners receive royalty and equity dividends as soon as practicable.  Disputes have broken out within communities near PNG LNG facilities as landowners fight to have their claims recognized.  Some clashes have been fatal, said Highlands clan leader Johnson Tape, one of 16 clan leaders with a claim over the Komo Air Field, used by the Exxon project.  \u201cOur clans fought each other, but now there is peace; we are one team fighting Exxon,\u201d said Tape.  Christopher Havieta, the governor of Gulf Province, where gas fields for the new project are located, said locals wanted to avoid the experiences of Exxon\u2019s PNG LNG.  \u201cIt was a foundation project and so a lot of exemptions were made and the end result is we have a lot of social problems that have risen up.\u201d","410":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Exxon Mobil Corporation is shown on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, December 30, 2015.

FILE PHOTO: A pump jack operates in front of a drilling rig owned by Exxon near Carlsbad, New Mexico, U.S. February 11, 2019. Nick Oxford\/File Photo  On Friday, the largest U.S. oil company is expected to report a 79-cents-a-share profit, down from 92 cents a year earlier, according to data provider Refinitiv. With little cash from asset sales and a third straight quarter of weaker year-over-year earnings, Exxon cannot resume share buybacks sought by investors this year, said analysts.  Chief Executive Darren Woods this year set a target of raising $15 billion by trimming its portfolio through 2021, above the average $3.3 billion a year rate between 2017 and 2013. The sales could include more oil-producing properties, compared with prior deals mostly in refining and marketing, he said.  But those goals are proving difficult. In its first quarter, proceeds from sales were just $107 million, the lowest in at least 11 quarters, and analysts expect the second quarter to come in at a similar level. Exxon last quarter agreed to sell a U.S. Gulf of Mexico property for $200 million.  \u201cThere\u2019s not enough cash flow for buybacks, which is what people want to see,\u201d said Jennifer Rowland, analyst at Edward Jones, who has a \u201chold\u201d rating on Exxon. Exxon may have to use debt to help fund its shareholder dividend, she said.  A package of offshore Gulf of Mexico oilfields that Exxon put on the market last autumn has languished, said analysts. More recently, the company has begun to market offshore properties in Nigeria and Norway, according to analysts and people familiar with the matter. Any one could raise several billion dollars in a sale, the people said.  Stephen Greenlee, who oversees divestitures as president of Exxon\u2019s Upstream Business Development group, was not available to address the asset sales, an Exxon spokesman said.  Exxon shares are rated a \"buy\" by just 23% of analysts, below BP PLC's BP.L at 71%, Chevron Corp's CVX.N 74%, Royal Dutch Shell's RDSa.L 80% and Total SA's TOTF.PA 89%, according to Refinitiv.  \u201cThe market is not ready to pay what Exxon thinks these assets are worth,\u201d William Turner, a vice president at researcher Welligence, said of the offshore U.S. properties. \u201cA lot of the recent transactions in the Gulf of Mexico have been going at discounted valuations.\u201d  Exxon\u2019s pitches are not the only going unanswered, said a U.S. merger and acquisition advisor who requested anonymity speaking about M&A matters. \u201cThere has been less activity. I\u2019m not sure if it is the bid\/ask or something else; but they just aren\u2019t there,\u201d the person said.  There is no doubt Exxon\u2019s cash could use a boost. Analysts slashed earnings forecasts to 79 cents a share from 97 cents after the company disclosed operating unit expectations this month.  \"We expect another large funding gap this quarter,\u201d wrote Cowen COWN.O analyst Jason Gabelman, who estimated Exxon's organic free cash flow this quarter will not cover the $3.7 billion needed for dividends.  The two areas expected to show improved margins during the period, crude sales and refining, were offset by weaker natural gas prices and higher maintenance costs. The result was \u201canother disappointing quarter,\u201d wrote Biraj Borkhataria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a client note.

The protest fizzled, with about 41% of the votes supporting the separation at the company\u2019s annual meeting, little more than the more than the 38% approval votes that similar resolutions garnered in recent years.  Shareholders also defeated measures calling for a special board committee on climate change and for a report on the risks of climate change to Exxon\u2019s U.S. Gulf Coast chemical plants.  At Chevron Corp\u2019s annual meeting on Wednesday, a proposal to create an independent chairman received just 26% of votes, and only 8% of votes favored a board committee on climate change.  In contrast, 99% of shareholders at BP Plc last week favored a resolution calling for the British oil company to meet a climate accord seeking to curb a rise in global temperatures. Royal Dutch Shell last year agreed to set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and link them to executive pay.  New York state\u2019s pension fund and the Church Commissioners for England, the endowment fund of the Church of England, had backed the independent chairman\u2019s proposal at Exxon after their resolution seeking emissions goals was struck from the ballot.  The 41% approval for the independent board chair proposal was the largest in the last seven times such a proposal has been considered.

Exxon has multi-billion-dollar expansion programs to find and produce new reserves of oil and natural gas, as well as to expand its refining and chemical footprint. It has projected shale production of 1 million barrels per day in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, as early as 2024.

It also plans to reduce its workforce by 14,000 people over the next two years as losses this year reached $2.37 billion.  Engine No. 1 faces a tough road. Exxon has beaten back past activist efforts to change its climate stance and to split the roles of chairman and chief executive.

Besides pushing Exxon to add new directors with more relevant energy industry experience to the board, the investment firm also wants Exxon to cut costs on projects that are unlikely to earn money, create a better plan for success in the renewable energy sector and to overhaul management compensation to better align with shareholder value creation, the letter said.  Exxon has long faced investor pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but this is the first time an activist firm is mounting a proxy contest that could resonate with both institutional investors concerned about the company\u2019s direction and retail investors worried about dividends, analysts said.  This was the first year since 1982 that Exxon has not raised its dividend and its share price has tumbled 41% in 52 weeks. Its $15 billion a year dividend should be cut because it drains cash that could restructure the business, some analysts said.  Engine No. 1 is run by Chris James, best known for technology investing but who also has considerable energy investment experience, and Charles Penner, who led activist investment firm Jana Partner\u2019s campaign against iPhone maker Apple to let parents limit children\u2019s phone in 2018.  Engine No. 1 owns roughly $40 million worth of stock in Exxon, according to a person familiar with the investment, while CalSTRS owns roughly $334 million, according to Refinitiv data.The campaign\u2019s success will depend largely on how Vanguard Group, BlackRock and State Street, the country\u2019s biggest index funds that are also Exxon\u2019s top three shareholders, react.  BlackRock and State Street are members of Climate Action 100+, an investor group pressing the largest greenhouse gas emitters to act on climate change.

U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan cited public policy and due process considerations in deciding not to enforce the October 2011 award against Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC), which was subsequently set aside by courts in Nigeria.  \u201cWhile this court may have inherent authority to fashion appropriate relief in certain circumstances, exercising that authority to create a $1.8 billion judgment is a bridge too far,\u201d Pauley wrote in a 50-page decision.

Exxon, Shell and their respective lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  \u201cNNPC is very pleased with the decision, and was always confident that there was no basis for a U.S. court to confirm the award,\u201d its lawyer Cecilia Moss said in an interview.  According to court papers, the 1993 contract anticipated that Exxon and Shell affiliates would invest billions of dollars to extract oil from the Erha field, about 60 miles (97 km) off Nigeria\u2019s coast, and share profits with NNPC.  But the affiliates, Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Co Ltd, accused NNPC of unilaterally \u201clifting\u201d more oil than was contractually allowed, at the behest of Nigeria\u2019s government, depriving them of billions of dollars of oil.  Pauley said Exxon and Shell still have \u201cmultiple appeals pending\u201d in Nigeria, and rejected their argument that it might be difficult to collect there.

Exxon posted its third straight quarter of losses on Friday and reduced spending plans for the coming year.  In common with others in the sector, the two are laying off a substantial portion of their workforce and expect to cut costs further as they try to reverse years of weak stock performance, worsened by the impact of movement restrictions.  U.S. oil prices have dropped 41% this year as the coronavirus forced billions of people into lockdowns. Demand recovered in the late northern hemisphere summer, but nations including Germany, India and the United States are again tackling a surge in infections, dampening demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.  The outlook for energy consumption \u201cdepends on when the world - this country and other countries - get control of the pandemic and those activities resume. We don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to be,\u201d said Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber.  Exxon shares were down 1.8% to $32.39 in early trading on Friday. Chevron rose 0.7%. Exxon shares have lost half of their value this year; Chevron\u2019s are down 40%.  Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil producer by production, earned $201 million in the most recent quarter, compared with a profit of $2.9 billion for the year-earlier period. Exxon posted a loss of $680 million, its third straight quarterly loss.  Exxon came into the year with an ambitious spending plan driven by investments in shale and offshore discoveries, particularly off the coast of Guyana. It originally planned to spend $33 billion in capital and exploration investment in 2020, though through three quarters it has instead spent just $16.6 billion.  SHAREHOLDER PAYOUT  Now, however, it is focused on preserving its dividend. Earlier this week, Exxon said it would cut its workforce by about 15% but kept its fourth-quarter dividend at 87 cents a share, making 2020 the first year since 1982 that it has not raised its shareholder payout.  \u201cIt is significant that Exxon is explicitly guiding to maintaining the dividend having reduced capex and potentially adding more divestments,\u201d said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors.  Exxon said its North American dry gas assets, worth roughly $25 billion to $30 billion, could be written down if the company decides those holdings are not part of its long-term investment plans.  Next year, the largest U.S. oil producer said capital spending would be between $16 billion to $19 billion, versus an adjusted plan to spend around $23 billion this year.  The company, once the most valuable in the United States by market capitalization, was this month surpassed in value by wind and solar provider NextEra.  In the top U.S. oil field, the Permian Basin shale field, Chevron expects output to dip to around 550,000 barrels of oil and gas per day, from 565,000 barrels per day this quarter, Breber said. It is likely to maintain that level until the global economy recovers.  Exxon\u2019s Permian output was around 401,000 barrels per day in the third quarter and it said its costs there had dropped 20%.","440":"NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) - U.S. Gulf Coast CBOB gasoline cash differentials rose on Wednesday, traders said, after news that a fire broke out at Exxon Mobil Corp\u2019s Baytown, Texas, refining and chemical plant complex.

Chevron Corp on Friday reported a 36% drop in third-quarter profit. Prices have fallen for oil and gas as U.S. shale producers keep pumping more oil amid slowing global consumption growth.  Exxon has been investing in major projects to boost production at a time when investors have been pressing oil companies to cut spending and increase returns to shareholders. It spent $7.7 billion in the third quarter, up from $6.6 billion the same period the year prior and higher than what analysts expected.  Exxon\u2019s cash flow, a closely watched metric by investors, fell 24% from a year ago. Investors have been looking for the company to improve cash flow to cover its dividends and capital expenses.  Despite rising output from U.S. shale, profits in Exxon\u2019s oil and gas production unit were down 49% to $2.17 billion on weaker prices, its lowest earnings in two years.  Its refining business earned $1.23 billion, down 25% from last year, on lower margins for its gasoline and diesel.  Its chemicals business was down 66% year-over-year. Results have been weaker because of global overcapacity in plastics and higher project expenses.  Exxon\u2019s oil equivalent production rose about 3% to 3.89 million barrels per day, the fourth quarter in a row of year-over year gains.  Its production in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, rose 7% from the second quarter to around 293,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily.","443":"May 14 (Reuters) - The development plan of Exxon Mobil Corp\u2019s Rovuma liquefied natural gas (LNG) project received the approval of the Mozambique government, the company said on Tuesday.

Houthi authorities gave long-awaited approval in November for a visit to assess the tanker. A U.N. team, which includes a private company contracted by the world body to do the work, aims to travel to the tanker early next month.  \u201cWe are continuing to prepare for the Safer tanker assessment and are broadly on track with this work,\u201d U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Friday.  \u201cHowever we have to look at potential impact of the (U.S. designation) on the Safer mission \u2013 there are questions about potential legal jeopardy for the people who are going to do the mission, which of course we all want to avoid,\u201d he said.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the move against the Iran-aligned Houthis on Sunday. It will come into effect next Tuesday, the last full day in office of Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.  Democratic President-elect Joe Biden takes office next Wednesday. The designation could be revoked by Biden\u2019s administration.  The Houthis control the area where the tanker is moored and the national oil firm that owns it.  The designation freezes any U.S.-related assets of the Houthis, bans Americans from doing business with them and makes it a crime to provide support or resources to the movement. U.N. officials are worried the designation will scare private-sector companies away from any business related to Yemen.  When asked about the U.N. concerns about the tanker mission, a State Department spokesperson said: \u201cWe have expressed our readiness to work with relevant officials at the United Nations, with international and nongovernmental organizations, and other international donors to address sanction implications.\u201d  Washington has said it will issue licenses and exemptions to allow the United Nations and aid groups to continue working in Yemen, which the United Nations describes as the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the people in need.

A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis.

Reuters had first reported details of the deal on Feb. 1, based on sources familiar with the matter.  \u201cGolden Pass will provide an increased, reliable, long-term supply of liquefied natural gas to global gas markets, stimulate local growth and create thousands of jobs,\u201d said Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods in a press release.  Executives from Exxon and Qatar Petroleum were due to make a joint announcement with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry Tuesday afternoon, the Energy Department said on Monday.  Worldwide consumption of LNG is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, triggering a race among oil and gas companies eager to dominate the market.  The expansion is part of Qatar Petroleum\u2019s plans to invest about $20 billion in the United States as the company seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas business.  Qatar, a tiny but wealthy country, is one of the most influential players in the LNG market with annual production of 77 million tonnes. It plans to boost capacity 43 percent by 2023-2024.  Currently, Exxon has a 30 percent stake in Golden Pass and Qatar Petroleum holds a 70 percent stake. The two have been strengthening a global alliance across LNG projects from the United States to Mozambique.  The Golden Pass project is one of many that could be approved this year. Companies are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year.  Qatar left the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year, allowing it to expand in the United States without concerns about proposed legislation that could limit OPEC members\u2019 investments in the country.

Output at the offshore Liza field, which Exxon operates in a consortium with Hess Corp and CNOOC Ltd has been restored to between 80,000-90,000 barrels per day (bpd), after falling to between 25,000-30,000 bpd, according to Vincent Adams, head of Guyana\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency.  Exxon had slashed output to avoid excessive flaring of natural gas produced alongside crude oil, as the equipment issues prevented it from reinjecting sufficient quantities of the gas back into the reservoir. Plans to build a gas pipeline to Guyana\u2019s coast have not yet gotten off the ground.  Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier this week, it called the outage temporary and said the field would be able to produce at full capacity once the equipment was fixed.  Guyana, a poor country with no history of oil output, joined the ranks of the world\u2019s crude producers in December. Exxon and its partners have discovered more than 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent in recoverable resources off the coast, and before the equipment issues had planned for output to rise to 120,000 bpd by June.","450":"A sign is seen at the entrance of the Exxonmobil Port Allen Lubricants Plant in Port Allen, Louisiana, November 6, 2015.

Exxon\u2019s Chapman said the company remains committed to selling $15 billion worth of assets through 2021.  The sales are needed to finance shareholder returns and major projects, but Exxon reported just $33 million in asset sales for the period, the lowest in at least 12 quarters. That follows proceeds from sales of $107 million in the first quarter.  Exxon\u2019s chemicals business fell to a loss in the United States for the first time in at least three years.

Woods in March told Wall Street investors that the expansions should help double Exxon\u2019s earnings by 2025 to about $31 billion.  Still, Exxon\u2019s first-quarter earnings fell short of expectations as weakness in its chemical and refining operations offset a boost from higher crude prices.  By voting to keep the roles combined, shareholders effectively gave support to Woods to lead the board and employees as they jointly try to meet those goals.  \u201cNo one in our industry can match our opportunity set today,\u201d Woods told fellow shareholders at the company\u2019s annual meeting in Dallas.  Shares of Exxon rose 3.4 percent to $81.13 on Wednesday after an analyst upgraded the company\u2019s stock, saying its low valuation relative to peers presented a buying opportunity.  \u201cCLIMATE CRIMINAL\u201d  Woods vowed that he would continue to work to address climate change, especially through biofuels research.  But outside the Dallas meeting, about 30 people gathered to protest what they said was Exxon\u2019s lack of accountability for its impact on global climate change.  There were no climate-related proposals for Exxon\u2019s shareholders to consider at this year\u2019s meeting after one was approved last year requiring an annual carbon report. Protesters on Wednesday said they were biding their time this year.  \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of optimism they\u2019ll (Exxon executives) will make good on it, but if they don\u2019t, we\u2019ll be back next year with an even stronger shareholder proposal,\u201d said Molly Rooke, a former Exxon employee who now volunteers with the environmental group 350.org.  Rooke\u2019s fellow protesters held a bevy of signs outside the meeting emblazoned with such slogans as \u201cExxon Mobil, Climate Criminal\u201d and \u201cArrest Exxon.\u201d  Shareholders also rejected a proposal that would have forced Exxon to provide greater disclosure on its lobbying expenditures and change its bylaws to how special meetings are called.  Shareholders approved a full slate of 10 nominees to the company\u2019s board of directors.","469":"(Adds closing price)  April 26 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Friday reported a 49 percent fall in first-quarter profit, missing forecasts due to a weakness across its major businesses that showed the turnaround at the company remains a work in progress.  The largest U.S. oil producer posted its first loss in its refining business since 2009 on higher maintenance costs and reported lower profits in chemicals and oil and gas.  \u201cIt was a tough market environment for us this quarter,\u201d Exxon Senior Vice President Jack Williams said on a call with analysts.  First-quarter profit fell to $2.35 billion, or 55 cents a share, from $4.65 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year ago.  Cash flow from operations of $8.3 billion was offset by capital spending and dividend payments of $10.4 billion.  \u201cThey had a large $2 billion cash flow shortfall that I don\u2019t think investors will be comfortable with,\u201d said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones.  Exxon continues to spend heavily to boost its oil and gas output, which had been on a years-long slide. Chief Executive Darren Woods has said he believes the company has an opportunity to invest even as peers have focused more on improving cash flow and share buybacks.  Shares fell 2.1 percent to close at $80.49 on Friday.  Analysts had expected Exxon to earn 70 cents per share, according to Refinitiv Eikon estimates.  Maintenance and production curtailments in its Canadian oil production, as well as weak oil and natural gas prices, pushed profits down in its oil and gas unit by 10.3 percent, the company said.  \u201cClearly, the corner is further away than we expected and we expect this to lead to underperformance in the near term,\u201d RBC Capital Markets said in a client note.  Exxon\u2019s oil and gas production rose 2 percent overall to 4 million barrels per day (bpd), up from 3.9 million bpd in the same period the year prior.  The company\u2019s growing output in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. shale basin, was a bright spot, rising to 226,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the first quarter.  It said it remains on track to produce 1 million boepd by 2024. Rivals Chevron Corp and Occidental Petroleum Corp are battling to take over Anadarko Petroleum Corp .  \u201cI would be surprised if over time we did not pick up some more Permian acreage,\u201d Williams said when an analyst asked about possible acquisitions, but added that Exxon \u201cdoesn\u2019t need to.\u201d  Exxon\u2019s refining business lost $256 million in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $940 million in the same period last year.  Its chemicals business earned $518 million, down 53 percent from profits of $1.1 billion during the same period last year, while its upstream business, which pumps oil and gas, had a profit of $2.9 billion, down 18 percent.

Rivals Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and BP Plc BP.L have disclosed massive spending cuts and writedowns due to the price drop.  Exxon faces a loss for the quarter of $2.3 billion, or 57 cents per share, according to estimates from Refinitiv IBES. It would be the second this year after a $610 million first-quarter deficit. Results are due out July 31.  (For a graphic on results by quarter, click here: tmsnrt.rs\/3gdqWI9)  The filing did not refer to asset writedowns. However, in a change from prior quarterly updates, Exxon noted the list may not include all charges. Shell outlined an up to $22 billion charge and BP an up to $17.5 billion writedown on the oil demand and price drops.  Exxon\u2019s oil and gas operations will swing to a loss compared with the first quarter because of sharply lower prices. That drop reduced the unit\u2019s operating profit by between $2.5 billion and $3.1 billion, the company said in its investor snapshot of operations.  Refining results will fall by between $800 million and $1.l billion compared with the first quarter on weaker margins and logistics differentials, it said.

Guyana says Caracas agreed to relinquish the area after a ruling by an international tribunal in 1899, but Venezuela later backtracked on that decision. The U.N. earlier this year referred the dispute to the International Court of Justice, a move welcomed by Georgetown but criticized by Caracas.

As part of a consortium with Hess Corp HES.N and China's CNOOC Ltd 0883.HK, Exxon has made 18 discoveries totaling some 8 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas in Guyana's massive Stabroek block, southwest of Kaieteur. Production of light, sweet crude from Stabroek's Liza-1 well began last year.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  ConocoPhillips, the third partner in the existing import terminal, plans to sell its 12.4 percent stake and does not plan to participate in the expansion, the people said.  LNG demand is soaring. Worldwide consumption of the fuel is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, triggering a race among oil and gas companies eager to dominate the market.  Golden Pass LNG began as a receiving and regasification facility in Sabine Pass, Texas able to handle up to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas imports per day.  However, as U.S. gas production has soared to new records, bolstered by shale production, the demand for export capacity has increased. The potential $10 billion expansion, first announced in 2014, would focus on this new market dynamic.  It is part of Qatar Petroleum\u2019s plans to invest some $20 billion in the United States as the company seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas footprint.  The most likely buyer for ConocoPhillips\u2019 stake is Exxon Mobil, two of the people said, adding that the existing partners do not want to bring in another participant, as plans for the project are in advanced stages.  Currently, Exxon has a 30 percent stake in the LNG export project, and Qatar Petroleum holds a 70 percent stake. The two have been strengthening a global alliance across LNG projects from the United States to Mozambique.  Exxon expects this year to \u201csanction\u201d the Golden Pass export terminal and another LNG project in Mozambique, Chief Executive Darren Woods said Friday on a conference call with analysts.  The company has been \u201cworking very closely with QP (Qatar Petroleum), our partner in Golden Pass, to advance that investment and look forward to announcing something here in the very near term,\u201d Woods said.  Qatar was the world\u2019s largest LNG producer in 2017 and has annual output of 77 million tonnes.  Exxon and ConocoPhillips declined to comment, while Qatar Petroleum could not immediately be reached for comment.  ConocoPhillips\u2019 stake sale led to delays in announcing the final decision to proceed with the project, one of the people said. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private. The move comes as ConocoPhillips hones its focus on international projects.  The Golden Pass project is one of many that could be approved this year. Firms are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year. That\u2019s well above the previous record of about 45 million tonnes in 2005 and triple last year\u2019s 21 million tonnes, Wood Mackenzie\u2019s research director for global gas and LNG, Giles Farrer, said last month.  More than 320 million tonnes of LNG was shipped globally in 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon shipping data.

Exxon was slower than rivals to react to this year\u2019s oil price decline and borrowed $23 billion to shore up a balance sheet strained by the losses and a nearly $15 billion annual dividend payment to shareholders.  Royal Dutch Shell and BP have outlined up to 15% workforce cuts while Chevron has asked employees to reapply for their jobs.  Woods said the demand loss is five times the decline of the 2008 financial crisis, but \u201cindustry under-investment today will increase the need for our products in the near future.\u201d  All oil companies face the same loss of demand, but Exxon has the burden of promising to keep its huge dividend without adding new debt, said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  Exxon is hoping to raise up to $2 billion from the sale of its 6.8 percent in the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) field in the Caspian Sea, according to industry sources.  Rival Chevron said in a statement to Reuters it had also decided to launch the sale of its 9.57 percent stake in ACG as well as its 8.9 percent interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline.  Exxon spokeswoman Julie King declined to comment, saying \u201cwe don\u2019t comment on market rumors or speculation\u201d. A spokesman for Azerbaijan\u2019s state energy company Socar said: \u201cThe report is about Exxon and there is no need for Socar to get involved.\u201d  For both companies, the sale would mark the end of a 25-year involvement. Exxon and Chevron were among five U.S. oil companies that helped create Azerbaijan\u2019s current oil industry soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and acquiring a stake in ACG in 1994.  The deal was dubbed by Azerbaijan and partners as the \u201cthe contract of the century\u201d thanks to the field\u2019s large reserves and hopes of future major discoveries that would help Europe diversify away from Russian oil and gas.  Even though the project is operated by British oil major BP BP.L, it had received substantial U.S. government support and a total of five American companies initially participated in the deal, including Exxon, Amoco, Unocal, Pennzoil and McDermott.  BP said it had no information about Exxon\u2019s or Chevron\u2019s plans.  The ACG project received particular Western support due to hopes it would help cut Europe\u2019s reliance on Russian energy, but those hopes faded as new large discoveries failed to materialize.  Most U.S. companies sold out of the project or were acquired by rivals, while U.S. support to the Azeri administration also shrank.  Azerbaijan also became more assertive in controlling its energy wealth by building up large stakes in its energy projects via state company Socar.  Other than Exxon and Chevron, BP holds a 30.4 percent stake in ACG and Socar a 25 percent stake.  The ACG fields still account for the lion\u2019s share of Azeri oil output. They produced around three quarters of overall Azeri crude output, or nearly 600,000 barrels per day, in the first half of 2018.

FILE PHOTO: A logo of Exxon Mobil is displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  But shares still fell to their lowest level in more than two years after the company said the spending would not boost near-term production, and investors who had expected large share buybacks were disappointed that executives did not announce any.  Exxon was once the industry\u2019s profit and cash-flow leader, but sagging output and a sliding share price have pushed total return, or share appreciation plus dividends, into negative territory over the last five years, according to Thomson Reuters data.  By comparison, total returns are up 16 percent for Chevron Corp CVX.N and 40 percent for Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L.  Exxon\u2019s growth plan will require billions of dollars in spending spread across U.S. shale fields, along with refinery expansions and deepwater megaprojects. The company said investments should drive profit to $31 billion in 2025 with crude prices at or above current levels.  It was the first time Irving, Texas-based Exxon has given an earnings forecast so far in advance. Shares closed down 2.5 percent at $74.26, the lowest close since January 2016.  Darren Woods, who became chief executive in January 2017 after predecessor Rex Tillerson retired and became the U.S. secretary of state, also said he was committed to being more transparent with investors.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot different today, not just style,\u201d Woods said at the company\u2019s annual analyst day in New York. \u201cMy objective is to get this organization focused on driving value and turning that value into results that you all will see.\u201d  Exxon said projects in Guyana and the Permian Basin region of Texas and New Mexico, as well as refining and chemical plant expansions, should drive earnings gains. Exxon reported an adjusted profit of $15 billion in 2017.  To achieve its goals, Exxon said it will boost spending on capital projects to $24 billion this year, $28 billion next year and an average of $30 billion from 2023 to 2025. Meanwhile, peers including Chevron are cutting spending or promising to hold budgets flat.  \u201cCapex is the price you pay for cash flow,\u201d said Woods, who added that every dollar in capital spending by Exxon in the past decade has generated $1.20 in operating cash flow.  Woods said he expected production to grow about 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe\/d), to about 5 million boe\/d in 2025 as 25 projects come online.  When an analyst asked if he would resign if the targets were not met, Woods did not directly answer, but said he intended to meet the long-range goals.  Tom Ellacott, senior vice president at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, noted that in the near term, Exxon\u2019s production will be flat, and growth in the next decade will require hitting goals at five key development regions.  In the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield, Exxon plans to triple production by 2025 at recently purchased low-cost acreage. The expansion highlights the increasing importance of U.S. shale alongside the company\u2019s global megaprojects.  NO EASY FIXES  Several analysts viewed the higher spending as problematic, even as they welcomed the pledge of greater transparency by a company that has been criticized for giving few operations details in recent years.  \u201cTo us this highlights that there are no easy fixes to rejuvenate Exxon\u2019s portfolio, and it is likely to take time for this investment to flow through into higher earnings, cash flow and returns,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria.  Exxon\u2019s operating margin, which measures profit after expenses, dipped to 5.1 percent last year, far below the industry median of 13.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Several analysts pushed Woods for still more transparency, asking him directly to participate in quarterly earnings conference calls. Unlike CEOs of most public companies including oil majors, Exxon CEOs historically have not joined the calls, where analysts can ask for operations details and outlooks.  \u201cPlease disclose more and meet us more. We would be greatly appreciative,\u201d Wolfe Research analyst Paul Sankey said to Woods at the meeting. Woods did not commit to being on the calls, but said he has been meeting more with investors in the past year.  Chevron on Tuesday said it should be able to raise production 4 percent to 7 percent this year and buy back shares for the first time in at least three years even without a substantial rise in oil prices.","505":"(Reuters) - A trial in which Exxon Mobil Corp stands accused of defrauding investors out of up to $1.6 billion by hiding the true cost of climate change regulation is expected to wrap up this week.

The following is a summary of how this litigation is playing out across the country:  ** Exxon is the first case to go to trial against a major oil company over climate change.  ** The New York attorney general has accused the Texas-based company of using two sets of books to hide the true cost of climate change from investors.  ** Exxon has assailed the lawsuit as political. The company has said the two sets of figures used to calculate dollars per ton of carbon emissions served different purposes - evaluating global demand and planning for specific capital projects.  ** The Massachusetts attorney general filed a similar lawsuit in October accusing Exxon of misleading investors and consumers for decades about the role fossil fuels played in climate change. Exxon has denied the allegations.  ** If the New York and Massachusetts lawsuits are successful, other attorneys general could bring similar cases, said Robert Percival, who heads the environmental law program at the University of Maryland.  ** In addition to the litigation by attorneys general, Baltimore, Rhode Island and about a dozen local governments have sued oil and gas companies including BP Plc and Chevron Corp over climate change. The lawsuits claim the companies created a public nuisance by producing the fossil fuels that contributed to global warming. They seek funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against extreme weather and rising sea levels brought on by climate change.  ** The companies deny the claims. They say the lawsuits will do nothing to stop climate change and that they are working to address the issue.  ** Meanwhile, teenagers across the country have filed more than half a dozen lawsuits accusing states and, in one case, the U.S. government of violating their constitutional rights to life, liberty and property by failing to implement policies that curb climate change. Governments have argued there is no constitutional right to a clean environment and that Congress and the White House, not the courts, should set climate change policy.","506":"FILE PHOTO: A sign is seen in front of the Exxonmobil Baton Rouge Refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, November 6, 2015.

Sonatrach gave no further details of the September 25 and 26 meetings but the energy producer has said it wants to boost output to increase revenues after a decline in prices hit its budget.  Some 95% of Algeria\u2019s foreign revenue comes from oil and gas sales. Since energy prices dropped in 2014, its foreign exchange reserves have fallen to $72.6 billion from $178 billion.  The talks with foreign oil majors come at a sensitive time for Algeria after mass protests in February unseated veteran president Abdleaziz Bouteflika, creating a constitutional limbo that the army hopes to resolve with an election in December.  Algeria, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a major gas supplier to Europe, has struggled to lift production to meet rising domestic demand, while foreign investors have often baulked at contract terms.  Sonatrach has a deal with Britain\u2019s BP and Norway\u2019s Equinor to develop Algeria\u2019s shale gas reserves, but industry sources said in March that talks with Exxon on developing a gas field had stalled.

FILE PHOTO: A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Sergio Moraes  Last Thursday, the Church Commissioners for England joined growing investor campaigns to demand changes at Exxon and backed calls for a board refresh and development of a strategy for the largest U.S. oil company\u2019s transition to cleaner fuels.  Several of Exxon\u2019s rivals this year have set longer-term climate ambitions, including Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.  Exxon said it would start reporting so-called Scope 3 emissions in 2021, a large category of greenhouse gases emitted from fuels and products it sells to customers, such as jet fuel and gasoline.  By 2025, Exxon would reduce the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions by 15% to 20% from 2016 levels. It did not set an overall emissions target, however, and reducing intensity means that emissions still could rise if oil and gas output grows.  The reduction would be supported by a 40%-50% decrease in methane intensity and a 35%-45% decrease in flaring intensity across Exxon\u2019s global operations, with routine natural gas flaring eliminated within a decade, the company said.  Since the 2015 Paris climate accord set a goal of keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F), pressure from investors has increased and some of Exxon\u2019s peers have agreed on more ambitious targets. Exxon said its goals were in line with the Paris accord, which the United States exited under President Donald Trump but that President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin.  \u201cWe certainly recognize the direction of travel that Paris sets out and the ambitions for society to get to net zero as early as possible before the end of the century,\u201d Peter Trelenberg, ExxonMobil director of greenhouse gas and climate change, told a news conference on Monday.  \u201cWhat we have tried to do is to develop specific actionable plans that we can hold our organization accountable to drive continuous improvement in emissions.\u201d  Further goals would be set as the 2025 targets are met, Trelenberg said.  \u2018NOTABLE TURN\u2019  The targets are \u201cencouraging news and doubtless a response in part to expanding shareholder pressure,\u201d said Timothy Smith, director of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) shareowner engagement at Boston Trust Walden Co, which has backed several shareholder proposals seeking improved disclosure at Exxon and other companies.  \u201cThey had long opposed detailing Scope 3 emissions, so this is a notable turn for them. And Exxon is known for its strength in managing policy pledges it makes.\u201d  The new targets do not address product emissions, a \u201cmain source of risk,\u201d said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at sustainability nonprofit Ceres. \u201cAt a time when even U.S. peers like Occidental and ConocoPhillips have set net-zero targets for their operational emissions and committed to addressing their product emissions, this effort from Exxon falls short.\u201d  Exxon said it would meet goals it set in 2018 by the end of this year to cut methane emissions by 15% and flaring by 25% compared with 2016 levels.  Last week, Engine No. 1, a $250 million California-based firm, called for expanded spending and pay cuts at Exxon, a board shake-up and a shift to cleaner fuels. Its views were supported at least in part by the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (CalSTRS) and hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which has $50 billion under management.

Oil Search had first hoped the projects to fuel an expansion of Exxon Mobil\u2019s PNG LNG plant would be approved in 2019, but talks with the government took longer than expected after an earthquake hit the country a year ago.  \u201cIt was a very tough year in Papua New Guinea for a range of reasons and it started with the earthquake,\u201d Oil Search Chief Executive Peter Botten said.  The quake killed more than 100 people in the rugged highlands region of one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, destroyed homes, roads and runways and knocked out gas and oil facilities.  It also stoked long-running antagonism against the PNG LNG project, as the country\u2019s take from the development has been much lower than anticipated and the government has been slow to pay out royalties to local communities.  Some people even blamed oil and gas operations for triggering the quake.  \u201cIn that context, we were doing a lot of negotiations on major projects and those sensitivities, I think, have been really well addressed,\u201d Botten told Reuters after the company reported its annual results.  Total is set to sign an agreement with the government by early April on its Papua LNG project, and Exxon Mobil is expected to follow soon after on terms for an expansion of its PNG LNG plant and development of a new gas field, P\u2019nyang, Botten said.  Total\u2019s Elk and Antelope fields, new gas from PNG LNG fields and P\u2019nyang are set to feed gas into three new processing units at PNG LNG, roughly doubling its output to 16 million tonnes a year, at a cost of around $13 billion, according to analysts.  \u201cI\u2019m very confident that a 2020 final investment decision is very achievable,\u201d Botten said.  Oil Search, which has a 29 percent stake in the PNG LNG project, posted a 13 percent rise in annual profit, boosted by higher prices for its LNG and oil, which offset a loss of output after the earthquake.  Net profit for the year ended Dec. 31 rose to $341.2 million from $302.1 million a year earlier, but fell short of analysts\u2019 forecasts around $360.83 million, according to Refinitiv data.  Oil Search raised its full year dividend to 10.5 cents from 9.5 cents in 2017.  Oil Search\u2019s shares fell 1.5 percent in a slightly firmer broader market.

Shares were down 3% to $62.86 in early trading. The stock has dropped about 29% since Chief Executive Darren Woods took over three years ago.  Exxon\u2019s full-year profits of $14.3 billion fell short of the potential $25 billion that Woods forecast last March at the company\u2019s investor day.  \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that 2019 was a challenging year for a number of our businesses,\u201d Woods said on a Friday morning call with analysts, noting that prices and margins are near or at 10-year lows for natural gas, refining and chemicals.  Exxon is betting that a growing global middle class will drive demand for its products despite what Woods called the \u201cshort-term impact\u201d of excess supply. \u201cWe believe strongly that investing in the trough of this cycle has some real advantages,\u201d he said.  Its production in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. shale field, was up 54% from a year ago to around 294,000 barrels of oil and gas daily. But quarterly profits on U.S. production were down 74% as the company spent heavily to boost output and suffered from lower natural gas prices.  Overall, the exploration and production business, its largest, benefited the most from the sale of production assets in Norway for $4.5 billion to V\u00e5r Energi AS.  Analysts said the weakness across its businesses means Exxon will still have to borrow to cover its shareholder dividend. Investors have been pushing oil companies to improve their returns by increasing dividends or share buybacks. Exxon has frozen its share repurchases except for offsetting dilution for employee awards.  \u201cUnlike its peers, the company is not generating free cash flow given its large capital spending program,\u201d said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones.

Oil majors have added and expanded plants to boost plastics production but now face a global chemicals glut and tariffs on U.S. exports to China. Exxon\u2019s chemicals business regularly generated $1 billion in quarterly profit as recently as 2018.  Its refining business earned $898 million, down 67% from last year, on lower margins.  Net income attributable to Exxon fell to $5.69 billion, or $1.33 per share in the quarter from $6 billion, or $1.41 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items, per share earnings were 41 cents, below Wall Streets expectation of 43 cents, according to Refinitiv. Analysts earlier this month had slashed estimates from 71 cents after the company warned of weakness in chemicals and refining.  The largest U.S. oil producer\u2019s oil and gas output rose less than 1% to 4.02 million barrels per day in the quarter, the sixth quarter in a row of year-over year gains.  Earlier this week, the company raised its Guyana oil estimates by 2 billion barrels, bringing total recoverable oil and gas resources from the discovery to more than 8 billion barrels.","522":"(Refiles to fix link to chart)  HOUSTON, July 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is preparing deep spending and job cuts, according to people familiar with the matter, as it fights to preserve a 8% shareholder dividend with a multi-billion-dollar quarterly loss looming.  It was unclear how extensive the cuts will be. The largest U.S. oil company slashed this year\u2019s budget by 30% in April, but Chief Executive Darren Woods\u2019s turnaround through rebounding demand and increased asset sales have not panned out and losses are climbing.  On Friday, Exxon is expected to report a $2.63 billion second-quarter loss, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, on sharply lower prices and weaker production, the first back-to-back quarterly losses in at least 36 years. Shares are down 35% so far this year as the coronavirus pandemic has crushed fuel demand.  The latest cost cuts are needed to preserve the company\u2019s nearly $15 billion annual payout to shareholders in the face of rising losses, the people said. Exxon will not generate enough cash from production operations to cover this year\u2019s dividend, analysts have said. It borrowed $18 billion earlier this year to bolster cash.  (For a graphic on Exxon's quarterly results, click: tmsnrt.rs\/3fbJW8P)  Woods so far this year held to the view that oil, natural gas and petrochemicals demand would rebound following an historic crash that saw global consumption fall by roughly one-third and U.S. prices plunge into negative territory in April.  Rivals BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell and Total have slashed up to $45 billion in the combined value of their oil and gas properties. Meanwhile, Exxon\u2019s 2019 plan to raise $15 billion by 2021 through asset sales has gotten off to a slow start, fizzling this year due to lackluster demand from potential buyers.  With energy prices expected to remain lackluster for years, Woods has turned to spending and staff cuts, and a business restructuring to salvage the payout. Rival Chevron Corp has stood out as producing enough cash from operations to cover its dividend.  Even if it does retain its full dividend this year, a cut is \u201ca real possibility in 2021,\u201d given the outlook for oil, said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones. \u201cThere is only so much Exxon can continue to lean on its balance sheet before they start to jeopardize\u201d the payout, Rowland said.  The dividend, which yields about 8% at Wednesday\u2019s closing price of $44.03 a share, is sacrosanct at Exxon, which until this year raised the payout annually for 37 years. Its market value, however, has dropped by half since Woods took over in January 2017.  Exxon has no plans for layoffs due to the pandemic and no percentage targets to reduce its workforce through this year\u2019s employee reviews, said spokesman Casey Norton.  \u201cWe are continually monitoring market conditions and our deep portfolio has flexibility to adjust our plans,\u201d Norton said.  Still, Exxon late last year changed its employee review system, internally referred to as forced ranking. The revision could increase the number of workers who land in the bottom category - to between 8% and 10% up from 3% last year. Those in the bottom category can either strive to meet their manager\u2019s performance goals or leave with 90 days\u2019 pay, person familiar with the matter said.  The ranking applies only to its U.S. professional staff. It has 74,900 employees worldwide, and about 40% are in the United States.  In April, Exxon slashed this year\u2019s capital spending budget to $23 billion, down $10 billion from the start of the year and to the lowest in four years. At the time, Woods said he could further revise spending this year or next.  Prior to the pandemic, Woods had vowed investments in new fields, new and expanded chemical and refining operations would revive Exxon\u2019s earnings and production.  In early 2019, he predicted investments in production and refining could produce a $4 billion increase in earnings this year over last and reach up to $21.5 billion by 2025 at $40 a barrel oil, slightly below the current price.  Woods also set a target to bring in $15 billion from asset sales between 2019 through 2021. Last year, it the sales brought in nearly $3.7 billion but proceeds this year are only $86 million.  \u201cIt has fallen a bit behind schedule but there have been reports there are several packages out,\u201d said Cowen analyst Jason Gabelman, who expects Exxon to reiterate the asset sale target on Friday.  Wall Street will watch for new capital and operating expense cuts \u201cand other available levers to defend the dividend,\u201d Gabelman said.","523":"March 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp:  * SAYS ITS PAPUA NEW GUINEA OPERATIONS ARE \u2018UNSCATHED\u2019 AFTER EARTHQUAKE  * SAYS IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA \u2018THE INTEGRITY OF OUR FACILITIES HAS BEEN VERY, VERY GOOD\u2019 AFTER EARTHQUAKE  * CEO DARREN WOODS SAYS HIS MAIN FOCUS IS BOOSTING RESULTS FOR COMPANY  * CEO WOODS SAYS NOT TRYING TO COMPETE WITH LEGACY OF PREDECESSORS LEE RAYMOND, REX TILLERSON  * CEO WOODS: \u2018WE SHOULD DO A HELL OF A LOT LESS TALKING AND A LOT MORE DELIVERING RESULTS\u2019  * CEO WOODS DECLINES TO SAY, WHEN ASKED, IF WILL RESIGN IF COMPANY DOES NOT MEET 2025 PROFIT TARGETS  * CEO WOODS: \u2018I HAVE EVERY INTENTION OF MEETING THOSE TARGETS\u2019  * SAYS CONTINUES TO SUPPORT TAX ON CARBON  * SAYS THINKS BIOFUELS NEED PRICES HIGHER THAN $100\/TON TO BE COMPETITIVE IN MARKET  * SAYS DOES NOT SEE ENOUGH INCENTIVES TO GROW CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION IN MARKETPLACE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reporting By Ernest Scheyder)","524":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil and Chevron are expected to report lower quarterly earnings per share when compared with last year\u2019s first quarter, though their stocks have outperformed smaller companies with both in the midst of aggressive expansion plans in shale oil.

Exxon\u2019s fourth-quarter Permian oil and gas output was 300,000 bpd; it plans to boost that to more than 1 million bpd by 2024, it said last month.  Chevron has bid $33 billion to take over Anadarko Petroleum to expand its reach. On Wednesday, rival Occidental bid $38 billion on Anadarko, kicking off the first takeover battle for an oil company in years.  U.S. oil prices are up more than 40 percent since late last year and refinery margins have improved, which could help position the majors for better results ahead, said Fernandez of Piper Jaffray & Co\u2019s Simmons Energy.  \u201cIf you get some weak results, shares might trade weaker on that day, but I think investors are largely going to be able to brush that off,\u201d Fernandez said.","525":"MOSCOW, March 1 (Reuters) - Russia\u2019s oil giant Rosneft said on Thursday the decision by Exxon Mobil Corp to withdraw from some joint projects with Rosneft was expected, RIA news agency reported citing spokesman Mikhail Leontiev.

The ruling by Justice Barry Ostrager in Manhattan Supreme Court followed a trial featuring testimony from investors, experts and former Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson.  The judge found that the New York State Attorney General\u2019s case failed to produce evidence that investors were misled. It was the first of several climate change lawsuits against major oil companies to go to trial.  Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement that her office \u201cwill continue to fight to ensure companies are held responsible for actions that undermine and jeopardize the financial health and safety of Americans.\u201d She did not say whether she would appeal.  Exxon said that the ruling affirmed the company\u2019s position that the investigation was \u201cbaseless.\u201d  \u201cWe provided our investors with accurate information on the risks of climate change,\u201d spokesman Casey Norton said in a statement.  The state\u2019s 2018 lawsuit said Exxon Mobil caused investors to lose up to $1.6 billion by falsely telling them it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business.  It said Exxon told investors it was projecting the impact of future regulations by using a \u201cproxy cost\u201d of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions in wealthy countries by 2040, but internally used figures as low as $40 per ton or none at all.  Exxon Mobil countered that the proxy cost and the internal greenhouse gas costs were distinct and used for different purposes.  Ostrager\u2019s decision said the evidence supported the company\u2019s argument that the two types of projected costs were \u201cdifferent metrics.\u201d  \u201cWhat the evidence at trial revealed is that Exxon Mobil executives and employees were uniformly committed to rigorously discharging their duties in the most comprehensive and meticulous manner possible,\u201d the judge wrote.  In October, as the New York trial was getting underway, Massachusetts announced its own lawsuit against Exxon, including allegations about proxy costs similar to those Ostrager rejected. Unlike New York\u2019s lawsuit, Massachusetts accuses Exxon of misleading consumers, not just investors.  Cities and counties across the United States have also sued Exxon and other oil companies seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels caused by climate change. The companies have denied liability.","527":"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - ExxonMobil PNG said on Tuesday it was investigating reports of vandalism on its Angore gas pipeline construction project in Papua New Guinea, amid ongoing tension in the Highlands region of the South Pacific nation.

The government declared a state of emergency and sent troops into the highlands region on the weekend after rioters went on a rampage protesting a failed court challenge to a provincial governor\u2019s election.  The 11-km (7-mile) Angore pipeline is being built to connect the Angore gas field to the Hides gas conditioning plant.  \u201cWe are investigating reports of vandalism relating to the Angore pipeline construction project,\u201d an ExxonMobil spokeswoman said in emailed comments.

REUTERS\/Jessica Rinaldi\/File Photo  It was the second consecutive quarter of weakness in Exxon units that make gasoline, plastics and related products. Exxon blamed weak margins for the income drop in those segments.  Shares of Irving, Texas-based Exxon fell 2.5 percent to $78.86 in premarket trading.  The company posted net income of $4.7 billion, or $1.09 per share, compared to $4.01 billion, or 95 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Profit jumped more than 50 percent in the company\u2019s upstream division, which pumps oil and natural gas, thanks largely to rising commodity prices.  In the downstream refining unit, though, profit fell 12 percent, and in the chemical unit, profit dropped 14 percent.  Production fell 6 percent to 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe\/d).  Exxon said earlier this month it resumed production at the Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (LNG) project a fortnight ahead of schedule after it was shut down in the wake of a deadly earthquake in February.  The shutdown cut quarterly earnings by $80 million and production by about 25,000 boe\/d, Exxon said. The company has struggled in the past 16 months to unwind some of the biggest bets taken by former Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, who left to become U.S. secretary of state in early 2017 before being fired by President Donald Trump last month.  Exxon has recorded billions of dollars in writedowns amid falling production since Tillerson left, and successor CEO Darren Woods has moved quickly to try to repair operations.  Woods laid out a bold plan last month to double annual earnings by 2025 through heavier investments in U.S. shale, Guyana and several LNG projects around the world.  The company plans to hold a conference call with investors to discuss quarterly results on Friday morning.

This will leave around 450 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas in the ground, Wiebes said, with an estimated value of approximately 70 billion euros ($81.5 billion).  The decision to halt Groningen production forced the government to broker a new deal with Shell and Exxon Mobil, whose 50-50 joint venture NAM is responsible for the field.  NAM will be required to pump as much gas as the government says is needed in the coming years. In return, it will see its share of the revenue from Groningen rise from 10 to 27 percent, Wiebes said, starting this year.

Rival Mozambique gas developer Anadarko Petroleum last week announced its first binding long-term LNG sales from its planned project.  In a presentation, Kretschmer also said Exxon expected to expand its existing LNG export operations in top producer Qatar, in addition to already announced expansions in Papua New Guinea.  Qatar rocked the LNG industry last year when it said it plans to raise its liquefaction capacity by 30 percent from 77 million tonnes a year, either by building new production units or expanding existing ones.  Exxon is one of three main Western partners in Qatari LNG facilities, but the Gulf state has not yet publicly disclosed which companies will benefit from the expansion.

Exxon is exploring a sale of its Malaysian oil-and-gas producing assets, among a number of other properties worldwide, confirmed spokeswoman Julie King.  The oil major has no agreements with potential buyers for the Malaysian properties and will continue to operate the fields as it explores their sale, she said. Exxon has said it aims to sell $15 billion in assets by 2021.  Bank of America declined to comment.  Irving, Texas-based Exxon has ramped up sales of assets around the world in recent months. Those it has offered or sold include production in Norway, Australia, Nigeria, Azerbaijan and Britain.  In Malaysia, Exxon operates 35 oil and gas platforms in 12 offshore fields and has working interests in another 10 platforms in five fields in the South China Sea, according to its website.  The operations produce 15% of Malaysia\u2019s oil output of 600,000 barrels per day and half of its natural gas output of over 2 billion cubic feet per day.  The fields are operated under a 50% and 78% stake in two large production sharing contracts (PSC), consultancy WoodMackenzie said in a note.  \u201cThe Malaysian assets are both operated and generally highly mature, with a significant amount of ageing infrastructure. A buyer will need to have strong operating credentials, and be recognised by (Malaysian national oil company) Petronas to be a suitably qualified and reputable operator,\u201d one banker said.  Exxon, which has operated in Malaysia for more than 125 years, will continue to operate other businesses in the country after any sale.

One source said Exxon was soon due to open a \u201cdata room\u201d - which would provide technical information on the fields, such as seismic and production details - in Nigeria.  The discussions focused on a number of onshore fields Exxon shares in joint ventures with Nigerian state oil firm NNPC, including oil mining leases 66, 68, 70 and 104, one source said. Exxon\u2019s share of oil production in those fields reached 120,000 bpd in 2017, the last year for which data was available.  Exxon is also weighing the possible sale of stakes in offshore fields in Nigeria, two sources said.  It is looking into offering for sale assets in Equatorial Guinea and Chad, according to two sources.  The Nigerian government has in the last decade supported a drive by domestic firms such as Oando, Seplat and privately held Aiteo to expand their operations in the country as international companies including Royal Dutch Shell sought to lower their presence due to oil spills resulting from pipeline sabotage.  Exxon recently launched the sale of its stake in Azerbaijan\u2019s largest oilfield, which would mark its retreat from the former Soviet state after 25 years.  Exxon announced earlier this year plans to boost its capital spending from $26 billion in 2018 to $30 billion in 2019 and up to $35 billion next year as it seeks to develop oilfields in Guyana and the U.S. Permian basin as well as gas projects in Mozambique and the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Siemens said the Gas and Power division, which includes its oil and gas, conventional power generation, power transmission and related services businesses, will be set up as a standalone company with the aim of a public listing by September 2020.  Last week Reuters, citing sources familiar with the matter, reported that Siemens was considering carving out the unit, whose 2018 profit fell by 75 percent to 377 million euros ($421 million) as revenue dropped 19 percent.  \u201cThe new company won\u2019t have to compete for resources with higher margin business like smart infrastructure and digital industries,\u201d Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser told reporters.  Siemens also plans to include its 59 percent stake in wind energy company Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy in Gas and Power.  The decision to separate the business, which will be led by Gas and Power head Lisa Davis, was approved by Siemens supervisory board, which met on Tuesday ahead of its second quarter figures on Wednesday.  The Munich-based company said it would remain an anchor shareholder in Gas and Power with between 25 and 50 percent.  \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do; it\u2019s necessary and courageous to trigger the planned changes when the company is doing well,\u201d Siemens chairman Jim Hagemann Snabe said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  STARVED  Unions also supported the decision, saying the business was better off outside Siemens.  \u201cIf the unit were to stay part of Siemens, investments would be further reduced. Thus the business would literally be starved to death,\u201d Siemens works council head Birgit Steinborn, who is also deputy chairwoman of the company, said in a statement.  \u201cWith the planned initial public offering in Germany, co-determination will be maintained and Siemens remains committed to keeping jobs in Germany and Europe. In a joint venture, for example with a Japanese competitor, we would have seen that at great risk,\u201d she added.  Siemens is targeting cost cuts of 2.2 billion by 2023 by cutting 10,400 jobs - mainly administration and support roles - at its remaining core units, including 3,000 at Smart Infrastructure and 4,900 at Digital Industries. The company will shed at least 10,400 jobs in the overhaul.  At the same time, Siemens plans to create 20,500 jobs by 2023, resulting in a net increase.  For its Smart Infrastructure unit - which makes fire safety and security products, grid control or energy storage systems for buildings - Siemens is now targeting a profit margin of 13-15 percent by 2023.  Digital Industries - which among other products offers industrial software and automation solutions for companies - is targeting a margin of 17-23 percent.  Kaeser stressed that Siemens has many options and plenty of time available for its rail unit Siemens Mobility.  Siemens tried to combine Mobility with listed peer Alstom, but scrapped the deal earlier this year as antitrust concerns mounted. Analysts expect that Siemens will eventually opt for a stock market listing for the unit.","549":"FILE PHOTO: Cars are seen infront of the head office of Angola's state oil company Sonangol in the capital Luanda, Angola June 7,2016.

Exxon Mobil\u2019s director general in Angola Andre Kostelnik, said the new field of exploration can be viewed as the resurgence of oil activity in the country.  The signs of fresh exploration in Angola comes after a period of near-paralysis due to a lack of drilling success, a slump in oil prices and a deteriorating relationship between Sonangol and the oil majors.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The oil giant was grilled at an Australian Senate hearing on tax avoidance, after having paid no tax since 2013, despite reporting billions of dollars in income from operations in the country. The hearing is part of a broader inquiry in corporate tax avoidance in resource-rich Australia.  The country\u2019s tax authorities are battling major miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto as well as oil and gas giants over booking income in countries like the Netherlands and Singapore, where tax rates are lower.  \u201cThe only reason we\u2019re not paying tax at the moment is because we just invested A$21 billion ($16.5 billion),\u201d ExxonMobil Australia Chairman Richard Owen told the Senate panel.  The company said it is in a tax loss position in Australia as it soaks up the cost of investing heavily in new gas production in the Bass Strait and the huge Gorgon gas project off Western Australia, both ramping up since 2017.  It expects to start paying A$600 million a year in corporate tax from 2021, the company\u2019s tax manager, Stuart Brown, said. Gorgon is unlikely to start paying petroleum resource rent tax until the mid-2030s, he said.  However, over the past decade ExxonMobil Australia had an effective tax rate of more than 50 cents in every dollar, including income tax and the petroleum resource rent tax.  ExxonMobil is undergoing an Australian tax audit regarding one inter-company, or related party, loan. But even if the Australian Taxation Office prevails in the dispute, it would have a \u201cvery, very small impact on our tax losses\u201d, Brown said.  The government won a landmark case against Chevron Corp last year over a contested tax bill of A$340 million ($267 million) stemming from a related party loan at an abnormally high interest rate that lowered the oil giant\u2019s taxable income in Australia.  ExxonMobil said the facts in its loan under audit were very different from Chevron\u2019s. Interest rates on the loan were set at around 3-5 percent, it said.  The Senate probe into corporate tax avoidance, which began in 2014, is due to issue a final report by the end of May.","553":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Production at Exxon Mobil Corp\u2019s 560,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) Baytown, Texas refinery was unaffected on Thursday by a closure of the upper Houston Ship Channel because of a protest by Greenpeace USA.

While firmly denied by Exxon and debunked by geologists, the accusations suggest that the project known as PNG LNG, one of the most successful liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments in the world, is sorely lacking goodwill from at least parts of the local population.  The concerns about the project \u2013 the country\u2019s biggest revenue earner - are even being expressed at senior levels in the Papua New Guinea government.  PNG\u2019s Vice Minister for Petroleum and Energy, Manasseh Makiba, told Reuters in a phone interview there should be an inquiry to respond to local concerns that mother nature had reacted after the ground was disturbed by drilling.  Graphic on Papua New Guinea's earthquakes and aftershocks: reut.rs\/2tq3zY6  \u201cIt could be man-made but that cannot be confirmed until a proper scientific inquiry can be done,\u201d said Makiba, who represents parts of the quake-hit area. \u201cWe need to resolve that.\u201d  PNG\u2019s Minister for Finance James Marape has also demanded answers from the company.  \u201cIn a world of science and knowledge, I now demand answer(s) from Exxon and my own government as to the cause of this unusual trend in my Hela,\u201d wrote Marape on his private feed on Facebook, referring to the quake-struck province.

Around Exxon\u2019s operation, communities remain fearful as the death toll climbs, with 18 more killed by a 6.7 magnitude aftershock on Wednesday.  Papua New Guinea straddles the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire.  Chris McKee, acting director of the Geohazards Management Division in Port Moresby, said there was no link between the project and seismic activity, which has included more than 120 quakes of magnitude 4.5 and greater in the week after the initial hit.  Graphic on Papua New Guinea government revenue and LNG income - reut.rs\/2D3KAlP  \u201cEarthquake activity has been going on much longer than the oil and gas industry presence in the region - there is no connection at all,\u201d McKee said.  Scientific evidence strongly suggests the earthquake was \u201cnaturally occurring and consistent with prior events\u201d, an Exxon spokeswoman said in a statement.  CORPORATE SUPPORT  Led by Exxon, with a one-third stake, and its Australian partners Oil Search OSH.AX and Santos STO.AX, PNG LNG could be shut for months as it inspects pipelines, the processing plant and the gas field for damage.  Exxon said it was giving $1 million to assist communities affected by the earthquake and was providing on-the-ground support to relief agencies so that resources could reach areas in greatest need.  \u201cLogistics remains a challenge with roads cut and communication with remote communities difficult,\u201d a company spokeswoman said. \u201cWe are continuing to provide logistics and human resources to help aid agencies to deliver support to our communities for the long term as they recover from this event.\u201d  Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten said he had not witnessed any local animosity toward the LNG project.

SHAKY GROUND  Exxon has previously faced resentment in PNG, which contains vast natural resources but remains desperately poor.  Martyn Namorong, national coordinator for landowner rights and governance lobby group PNG Resource Governance Coalition, said the quake had reawakened concerns raised in 2012 when a landslide tore through a quarry used by Exxon, killing at least 25 people.

People are wondering what might be the contributing factor of oil and gas extraction,\u201d said Namorong, referring to the quake.  Exxon said at the time it had closed the Tumbi quarry five months before the landslide.  \u201cTumbi was a tragic event that had its own unique set of circumstances,\u201d Exxon told Reuters in an email, without elaborating.  Concerns flared again last year when the oil major had to evacuate staff due to unrest in Hela province, where the project\u2019s Hides Gas processing unit is located.  The trouble was linked to national elections and disputes over royalties from the PNG LNG project, which generates around $3 billion in sales per year at current LNG prices LNG-AS.  \u201cPEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED\u201d  The earthquake forced a closure of the Hides Gas processing facility which feeds a 700-km (435 miles) pipeline snaking through the jungle to the LNG plant and export terminal near Port Moresby.  The disruption in Papua New Guinea comes shortly after Exxon reported disappointing results, with PNG LNG a rare bright spot. Its shares have underperformed compared with its main competitors Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, Chevron CVX, BP BP.L and Total TOTF.PA.  \u201cPNG LNG had reportedly been running at a very healthy 20 percent above nameplate capacity... There will be some hit to the PNG industry,\u201d said Readul Islam, research analyst at consultancy Rystad Energy.  If repairs take long, the quakes could even delay plans with France\u2019s Total to double output to around 16 million tonnes per annum at an estimated cost of $13 billion.  The companies plan to add three new LNG units, or trains, with two underpinned by gas from the Elk-Antelope fields, run by Total, and one underpinned by existing fields and a new Exxon-run field.  Repairs have been complicated by landslides blocking roads and the closure of the Komo airfield, which is the main lifeline of the region to the outside world.  Oil Search\u2019s Botten said, importantly, the integrity of the gas facilities had been maintained and there were no leaks.  Still, the aftershocks have kept the local population on edge.  \u201cThe people are terrified,\u201d said Australian Sally Lloyd, from near the quake zone in Mount Hagen. \u201cThey think the world is coming to an end.\u201d","555":"A sign is seen at the entrance of the Exxonmobil Port Allen Lubricants Plant in Port Allen, Louisiana, November 6, 2015.

One only has to look at current market conditions to realize that this is simply not true.\u201d  Plummeting demand for oil due to the pandemic, coupled with a flood of supply resulting from a Saudi-Russia price war, led U.S. oil futures prices to crash 54% in March.  COVID-19 is the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Pattern wages refers to the national pattern agreement reached in January 2019 between the USW International and U.S. refiners that sets wage increases for all USW-represented workers.  Under the proposal rejected in January, pay was set to go up 3.5% in the first year and 4% in the second year. In the third year, the increase would match the pay hike in the new national agreement the USW will negotiate for oil industry workers with energy companies in January 2022.  Brooks said the company has suggested the pay proposals would be less if the two sides go back to the bargaining table.  Negotiations for a new contract to replace the current pact that expires on May 15 began in December with a company-proposed three-year extension that was rejected in January by workers in the 560,500 barrel-per-day refinery and the complex\u2019s laboratory.  Chemical plant workers accepted the extension.  The sticking point for refinery and lab workers is Exxon\u2019s proposal to lengthen by six months the time before a new workers\u2019 wages reach the same level as veteran workers.  Even though the current contract expires on May 15, the refinery and lab workers could not walk off their jobs for 60 days nor could Exxon lock them out under an agreement between the company and the union.","562":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The head of Papua New Guinea-focused energy firm Oil Search Ltd said he did not expect to make any significant new concessions on a gas deal it and ExxonMobil Corp hope to strike with the South Pacific nation\u2019s new leader.

Marape, a former finance minister, has promised he would be \u201ctaking back\u201d the economy and revising resource-sector laws after the resignation of his predecessor, Peter O\u2019Neill.  Marape said on Wednesday that he wanted to increase the amount of revenue flowing from resource projects, after years of underwhelming returns most notably from the gargantuan PNG LNG project, run by Exxon in partnership with Oil Search and others.  But changes would be gradual, Marape said, and unlikely to take effect before 2025.  Papua LNG, operated by Total, plans to develop the Elk and Antelope gas fields to feed two new liquefied natural gas processing units, called trains, at the PNG LNG plant.

Exxon said that because it is incorporated in Texas and New Jersey, Healey had no basis to seek documents to conduct a Massachusetts-based investigation.

Prime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill said in the country\u2019s capital of Port Moresby on Friday that \u201cphysical terms\u201d had been agreed. He said negotiations over how revenue would be shared in the community and provincial governments required more work.  \u201cI\u2019d say we are almost 50 to 60 percent through already about our understanding of revenue sharing,\u201d O\u2019Neill said, in response to questions from Reuters.  Disagreements over land-owner rights and revenue-sharing agreements have been an almost constant feature of resource development in PNG.  The non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) is basically a commitment by the government to finalise a gas agreement in early 2019, which would lead to the development of Papua LNG, run by Total.  Held on the sidelines of the PNG-hosted Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said he hoped to make progress on the agreement quickly.  \u201cThere is still some work to be done, but we are ambitious and I\u2019d love to come back not in two years but in 10 months or before,\u201d Pouyanne said.  Papua LNG will supply gas from the Elk-Antelope fields for two new processing units, called trains, at Exxon Mobil\u2019s PNG LNG plant.  At the same time, Exxon Mobil plans to develop gas at the P\u2019nyang field to help fill a third new train at the plant. All together the projects will double the plant\u2019s output to around 16 million tonnes a year.  Exxon representatives attended the MOU signing, but the company was not immediately available for comment.  The companies want to make a final investment decision on the expansion in 2019, racing to start exporting from the new trains by 2024, when the LNG market is expected to need new supply to meet rapidly growing demand in Asia.  Analysts expect the expansion to cost around $13 billion, well below the $19.5 billion cost of the original project, which involved building a wide range of infrastructure from scratch, including a 700-km (435 mile) pipeline through the nation\u2019s rugged highlands down to the coast and underwater to the plant site near Port Moresby.

Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape on Friday called off negotiations with Exxon on the P\u2019nyang field, blaming the energy giant for failing to budge on a proposed deal that was \u201cout of the money\u201d.  The expansion of liquefied natural gas exports is crucial for the impoverished Pacific nation, but is vying with several proposed LNG projects in Australia, Mozambique, Qatar, Russia and the United States.  One of Exxon\u2019s partners in the PNG project, Oil Search Ltd, said on Monday the terms the government had sought would have made the project unprofitable.  \u201cUnder the terms proposed by the State, the joint venture partners were unable to obtain a return on their investment that made the project investable and bankable,\u201d Oil Search said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.  Shares in Oil Search fell as much as 11.5% early on Monday in their first session since the collapse of the talks, on track for their worst one-day fall in more than four years.  The P\u2019nyang agreement was one of two agreements needed for Exxon and its partners to go ahead with a $13 billion plan to double LNG exports from the Pacific nation. The other agreement, the Papua LNG pact, was sealed with France\u2019s Total SA in September.  The government was seeking terms on P\u2019nyang that would give the state more than the 45%-50% take that PNG is set to reap on the returns from the Papua LNG project, and well above the terms Exxon negotiated in 2008 for its PNG LNG project, a person close to the negotiations said.  P\u2019nyang and Total\u2019s Papua LNG project were designed to feed three new processing units, called trains, at Exxon\u2019s PNG LNG plant, with the two projects sharing infrastructure in order to save $2 billion to $3 billion dollars on construction costs.  Oil Search said on Monday it would now focus its attention on the Papua LNG project, which will feed two new trains, adding 5.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to the plant\u2019s 8 mtpa capacity. Joint venture partners are set to meet \u201cin the short term\u201d to plan their next steps, it said.  Bank of America analysts estimated that separating the projects would pare the cost savings by a third and delay first production from Papua LNG by 18 months to 2026.  \u201cThe two projects are rather entwined. There\u2019s a bit of uncertainty now. Everything\u2019s going to be delayed for quite a period of time,\u201d said Andy Forster, senior investment officer at Argo Investments, which owns Oil Search shares.  Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on Friday the company hoped to revive talks on P\u2019nyang to get to a \u201cwin-win proposition\u201d but flagged that the company was in no hurry as it had other projects it could advance elsewhere.  \u201cBut I also think we\u2019ve got some time given all the other opportunities in front of us and, frankly, given where we\u2019re at today in the supply-demand balance of LNG,\u201d Woods told analysts on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call last Friday.  A global glut of LNG has driven spot LNG prices to more than 10-year lows below $4 per million BTUs (mmBTU), posing challenges for projects looking to line up long-term customers.  PNG Prime minister James Marape, who came to power last May on a pledge to reap more benefits from the country\u2019s abundant mineral and energy resources, on Sunday said he was comfortable with the hard line he had taken.  \u201cI am sorry but if you show little respect to our motive to gain extra for the country, you will lose my support,\u201d Marape said in a post on Facebook.

Exxon posted its third straight quarter of losses and reduced spending plans for the coming year.  In common with other energy majors, the two are laying off a substantial portion of their workforce and expect to cut costs further as both try to reverse years of weak stock performance, worsened by the impact of movement restrictions.  U.S. oil prices have dropped 41% this year as the coronavirus forced billions of people into lockdowns. Demand recovered in the late northern hemisphere summer, but nations including Germany, India and the United States are again tackling a surge in infections, stemming demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.  The outlook for energy consumption \u201cdepends on when the world - this country and other countries - get control of the pandemic and those activities resume. We don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to be,\u201d said Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber.  Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil producer by production, earned $201 million in the most recent quarter, compared with a profit of $2.9 billion for the year-earlier period. Exxon posted a loss of $680 million, the third straight quarterly loss.  Exxon came into the year with an ambitious spending plan driven by investments in shale and offshore discoveries, particularly off the coast of Guyana. It originally planned to spend $33 billion in capital and exploration investment in 2020; through three quarters it has instead spent just $16.6 billion.  Next year, the largest U.S. oil producer said capital spending would be between $16 billion to $19 billion, from an adjusted plan for spending around $23 billion this year.  Earlier this week, Exxon said it would cut its workforce by about 15% and kept its fourth-quarter dividend flat at 87 cents a share, making 2020 the first year since 1982 that it has not raised its shareholder payout.  The company, once the most valuable in the United States by market capitalization, was this month surpassed in value by wind and solar provider NextEra.  In the top U.S. oil field, the Permian Basin shale field, Chevron expects output to dip to around 550,000 barrels of oil and gas per day, from 565,000 barrels per day this quarter, Breber said. It is likely to maintain that level until the global economy recovers.  Exxon\u2019s Permian output was around 401,000 barrels per day in the third quarter and it said its costs there had dropped 20%.","575":"BOSTON (Reuters) - The state of Massachusetts sued Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N on Thursday, accusing the oil giant of misleading investors and consumers for decades about the role fossil fuels play in climate change.

Healey, a Democrat, and her New York counterpart launched investigations into Exxon following news reports in 2015 saying company scientists determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.  Those news reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.  Healey in 2016 issued a so-called civil investigative demand to Exxon seeking documents to determine whether it had violated Massachusetts consumer-protection law through its marketing and sale of fossil fuel products.  The company fought the records request, and while courts have sided with Healey, the company to this day has not provided her office any records. The state built its lawsuit on evidence from other sources, including New York\u2019s case, Healey said.  In its 2018 lawsuit, New York accuses Exxon of falsely telling investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business, defrauding investors out of up to $1.6 billion.

Rowland expects refining and marketing to return to profitability due to higher margins while chemicals should continue to post weaker results given lower margins and scheduled maintenance.  In April, the company reported first-quarter profit that slumped 49% to $2.4 billion and missed analysts\u2019 estimates due to a weakness across its major businesses.

The 7.5 magnitude quake led Exxon to shut its $19 billion LNG facility, the country\u2019s biggest export earner, amid fears of damage to gas field infrastructure and the pipeline that carries gas to the coast.  Exxon planned a full visual inspection of the pipeline route, while specialist engineers would need \u201ca little bit time\u201d to assess damage to the project, company officials said.  \u201cWe have had no indications that the PNG LNG pipeline has sustained damage and will be undertaking a full visual inspection of the pipeline right of way as part of our ongoing assessments,\u201d ExxonMobil\u2019s PNG spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters.

FILE PHOTO: Darren Woods, chairman & CEO of Exxon Mobil Corporation, attends a news conference at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 1, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Another year of poor profit could require Exxon to re-evaluate its bold spending plans or weaken its ability to weather the next oil-price downturn, say oil analysts. Exxon already must borrow or sell assets to help cover shareholder dividends.  The world\u2019s biggest publicly traded oil firm after Saudi Arabian Oil Co 2222.SE, Exxon was long considered one of the best-managed majors and most capable of coping with volatile prices due to its size.  Those advantages have slipped in recent years, however, with the drop in once-steady earnings from chemicals. Its total shareholder returns of negative 13% in the five years through this month compare with a 25% gain at Chevron Corp CVX.N and 82% at BP Plc BP.L, according to Refinitiv.  Two years ago, CEO Woods promised to restore flagging earnings by heavily investing in operations even as rivals cut spending. The plan to crank up chemicals, refining and increase oil output pushes capital expenditures to as much as $35 billion this year, up from $19 billion in 2016, the year before Woods took over as CEO after running Exxon\u2019s refining and chemical businesses.  Last March, he forecast potential earnings could hit $25 billion this year and nearly $31 billion in 2021, close to the $32.5 billion it earned in 2014 before the oil-price collapse.  The hoped-for payoff, however, has run headlong into a global chemicals glut, tariffs on U.S. exports to China, and lower margins in fuels. Exxon\u2019s refining profit last year fell on equipment outages.  The company declined to comment ahead of quarterly earnings, expected on Friday.  On Monday, Exxon shares traded under $65 - close to their level of 10 years ago.  The company recently telegraphed weak fourth-quarter results because of chemicals and refining businesses. Wall Street cut profit forecasts through 2021 on the sour outlook for both. Exxon \u201cseems to be tracking way behind their own expectations,\u201d said Evercore ISI analyst Doug Terreson, who slashed his quarterly forecast by a third, to 55 cents a share.  To see a graphic on Exxon's chemicals and refining profit, please click here -  CHEMICALS OVERBUILD  In chemicals, Woods expanded the company\u2019s output of polyethylene, a business where it has 9% of global production capacity, to benefit from demand for plastic bags, food packaging and consumer goods. Output rose last summer at the depth of the U.S.-China trade dispute, and industry margins for a key polyethylene fell 30% compared with levels between 2016 and 2018, said James Wilson, analyst at pricing provider ICIS.  \u201cThe industry ended up overbuilding,\u201d said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst with investment firm Raymond James. \u201cExxon, of course, is among the companies that led that build-out.\u201d  In refining, outages and higher maintenance costs at Exxon refineries in the United States, Canada and Saudi Arabia hurt profit, according to regulatory filings.  Crude oil prices and slack global demand from the trade dispute are squeezing profit across the industry, said Garfield Miller, chief executive at Aegis Energy Advisors.  This month, an Exxon regulatory filing implied a loss in chemicals of about $200 million for the fourth quarter, and refining earnings of just $400 million.  In contrast, chemicals and refining delivered $7 billion to $11 billion annually for Exxon between 2013 and 2018. In the first nine months of last year, the combined profit was $2.37 billion. Exxon\u2019s regulatory filing indicates 2019 earnings for the two at about $2.52 billion, the lowest in at least a decade.  Woods has halted the company\u2019s oil output declines by ramping up in shale. Oil volume has risen year-over-year for five straight quarters, reversing annual declines between 2016 and 2018.

Global demand for the plastic resins and pellets that Exxon makes is rising, said Marc Levine, chief executive of Plantgistix, which provides logistics for U.S. plastic manufacturers.  \u201cThis is the first time in my lifetime and in the plastics industry\u2019s lifetime where we make plastics resin for export,\u201d said Levine.  China in 2018 placed an additional 25% tariff on U.S. polyethylene imports, a move that helped send North American margins to the lowest levels since 2011, said Joel Morales, a polymers analyst at consultancy IHS Markit.  \u201cImagine having a lot of something and your biggest, easiest consumer you can\u2019t do business with,\u201d Morales said.  The January U.S.-China agreement does not remove Chinese or U.S. tariffs on chemicals, plastics or oil.  Exxon has ramped up asset sales, aiming to collect $15 billion by next year to balance spending. So far, results have been tepid. It expects to receive about $3.6 billion from selling Norwegian oil and gas production assets.  Weak demand for those assets comes as rivals have written off the value of their own properties. BP, Chevron, Equinor ASA EQNR.OL, Repsol SA REP.MC and Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L last year cut a total of $22 billion primarily on U.S. assets due to sharply lower gas prices.

The unions are holding talks with the French oil sector employers federation UFIP over wages on Thursday.  Defresne said refineries affected by the strike included all four of Total\u2019s refineries in France.

As of now, only one refinery in France, Exxon Mobil\u2019s 240,000 bpd Port-Jerome-Gravenchon refinery, was not affected by the strike, Defresne said.  A spokeswoman for Total said output and products deliveries at three of its four refineries and a depot were slightly impacted by the strike.

The project will include 90 wells, a central production facility and export infrastructure connected to a pipeline and refineries, the company said.  Exxon began a pilot project in the 99,000-acre Bajo del Choique-La Invernada block, located about 114 miles northwest of Neuqu\u00e9n city, in 2016 after successful results from an initial exploration.  The company\u2019s development in Argentina has been slow due to several reasons, including the geographic remoteness of the country from U.S. shale operations as well as government controls on natural gas prices.  However, the country last month awarded permits for hydrocarbon exploration in 18 areas off its southern coast to companies, including Exxon, to boost its reserves, which fell in the last decade due to regulations that discouraged foreign investment in the energy sector.

After several years investigating the company\u2019s communications with shareholders, Barbara Underwood unveiled a suit that claims the $340 billion oil giant has misled investors about how climate change regulation would affect its business. Shareholders weren\u2019t dupes, though. Their revolt last year forced the company to start addressing the issue. Legal heat should prod Exxon\u2019s owners to demand more than baby steps.  The world\u2019s largest independent, publicly-traded oil company was already on the defensive with climate change. Last year shareholders voted to demand that the company disclose more about how carbon-related environmental risks would affect its business. Then there are the rolling lawsuits, including one earlier this year when two California cities sought to make Exxon pay for coastal flooding.  The New York state AG\u2019s lawsuit claims that Exxon didn\u2019t properly account for future regulatory changes when it was valuing its businesses. Exxon called the claims \u201cbaseless\u201d and said it is looking forward to refuting them. The company has some tricks up its sleeve. With California, for example, it used some of the government\u2019s disclosures in bond documents to show that the municipalities had hedged their assumptions about climate change when it was trying to raise debt.  Exxon, under pressure from shareholders, has made some changes since Chief Executive Darren Woods took over from Rex Tillerson at the beginning of last year. In March the company attempted to address shareholder concerns about the effect of climate during its investor day. This summer it ended its association with a conservative political lobby group. Then earlier this month it said it made a donation to a campaign that is working to promote a U.S. tax on carbon-gas emissions.  None of that yet amounts to a thorough investigation of the climate risks in Exxon\u2019s businesses. Nor has it mattered much to what shareholders care about the most: Exxon\u2019s stock price. The shares are down almost 8 percent since Woods took over, after accounting for dividends, worse than the energy sector overall. Shareholders have mostly gone quiet, however, and they didn\u2019t urge further action at this year\u2019s annual meeting in May. New York\u2019s lawsuit may just jolt some of them back into action.","603":"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A senior Exxon Mobil Corp executive said on Wednesday the company is still assessing damage to its natural gas processing plant in the mountains of Papua New Guinea, knocked out by a strong earthquake last month.

ExxonMobil\/Handout via REUTERS  A powerful 7.5 magnitude quake struck near Exxon\u2019s Hides facility on Feb. 25, killing dozens of people and halting production at the site. The temblor damaged power infrastructure and also led to the closure of the Komo jungle airfield, making access to the remote facility difficult.  Several aftershocks, as well as the remoteness of the gas field and processing plant - more than 700 kilometers from the export facility near the capital, Port Moresby - have made it difficult to assess and repair any damage, making it unclear when production and exports can resume.  \u201cWe\u2019re doing a full assessment right now...We had a few aftershocks so you have to go through the assessments again up in the mountains to recheck the facilities,\u201d said Neil Duffin, President of ExxonMobil\u2019s production company, speaking during an oil and gas industry event in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  Prior to the shutdown, Exxon\u2019s Papua New Guinea Liquefied Natural Gas (PNG LNG) export project, had been producing at about 20 percent above its nominal capacity of 6.9 million tonnes a year.  Exxon has previously said it plans to restart shipments within eight weeks of the shutdown.  \u201cI\u2019m hoping we can actually start flowing gas within that two-month period,\u201d Duffin said.  Led by Exxon, with a one-third stake, and its Australian partners Oil Search and Santos, PNG LNG is the impoverished country\u2019s biggest revenue generator, bringing in around $3 billion in sales per year at current LNG prices. But the facility has also faced local criticism due to accident, as well as claims it did not spread wealth locally.  Exxon said in February it plans to almost double the facility\u2019s export capacity to 16 million tonnes per year, together with its partners.  The partners in Papua New Guinea are racing to start producing from new trains by around 2023 or 2024, when the LNG market is expected to need new supply due to rapidly growing demand in Asia and a lack of other new projects.","604":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018.

The start-up of three LNG export plants in northeastern Australia has sapped gas from the local market and also led to higher prices, as most of the new supply is from higher cost coal seam gas wells.  At the same time, drilling bans in the southeastern states of Victoria and New South Wales have curbed new supply to fill a gap as the offshore fields that meet about 40 percent of the southern states\u2019 needs are drying up.  MANUFACTURERS SUFFER  If supply doesn\u2019t improve and prices fail to come down, manufacturers dependent on gas will shut, Australian competition regulator warned on Thursday in its latest report on the east coast gas market.  The latest casualty of the gas crunch was an ageing chemicals plant in Melbourne, which a unit of Dow Inc said this week it would be shutting, partly due to high gas prices.  That followed the closure of a maker of polystyrene coffee cups in Sydney and a brick and clay paver maker in Queensland, both of which partly blamed high gas prices, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said.  Gas prices to manufacturers are now around A$9 to A$11 per gigajoule (GJ), or half the price they were two years ago after the government pushed east coast exporters to release more gas for domestic purposes, but prices are still more than triple the level manufacturers paid five years ago.  \u201cI think at A$7 gas many of the manufacturing plants can survive. The problem is if they don\u2019t get that soon, they just won\u2019t be here,\u201d ACCC Chairman Rod Sims told reporters at the conference.  However, analysts said imported LNG was unlikely to be this cheap given the distance it has to travel, with new local supplies needed to bring certainty of supply and potentially cheaper prices.  \u201cWe are going to have a shortfall from 2021, and new infrastructure in some form is going to be needed to service that,\u201d said Nicholas Mumford, managing director of Mumford Commercial Consulting.","615":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N on Tuesday throttled back investment in shale, natural gas and deep water production, cutting planned capital spending by 30% this year as the coronavirus pandemic saps energy demand and oil prices tumble.  Oil companies have pulled back 2020 spending plans by an average of 22% as countries limit air travel, order businesses closed and tell residents to stay home to combat the pandemic that has killed more than 76,000 worldwide.  In a one-two punch, crude prices have sunk nearly 60% this year on lower demand for fuel spurred by the pandemic-driven economic hit and an oil price war.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like what we\u2019re experiencing today,\u201d Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on Tuesday as he detailed spending cuts on a conference call.  Exxon was the last of the oil majors to move, and its spending cut was deeper than those of most rivals.  The largest U.S. oil producer set 2020 capital expenditure at $23 billion, down $10 billion from its earlier plan and the lowest in four years. Spending could drop even further and continue into next year if required, Woods said.  For a graphic on the top oil producers' spending cuts, please click here: reut.rs\/39u1Dh3.  Graphic - Oil Majors Cut Capex:  NO ACTION ON DIVIDEND  The company took no action on its shareholder dividend, which analysts had been closely watching for any reduction. Exxon spent $14.8 billion last year on shareholder payouts.  \u201cWe view these moves favorably as it helps reduce its cash flow shortfall and supports the dividend,\u201d said Edward Jones analyst Jennifer Rowland.  Exxon\u2019s cuts will weigh the heaviest on U.S. shale, where it had plunked down $6 billion in 2017 for drilling leases and boosted output in a drive to pump around 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year.  FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: Darren Woods, CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at a news briefing in New York, U.S., March 1, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Its output there this year will be around 15,000 bpd lower than planned and up to 150,000 bpd lower next year, Woods said.  Exxon did not detail its Permian spending cuts, where it recently had 58 drilling rigs at work. RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria estimated it was spending up to $6 billion a year in the Permian, \u201cand we see no reason why capex and the rig count cannot be reduced by 50% at a minimum in 2020.\u201d  Exxon expects world oil demand to tumble by 25% to 30% in the short term, Woods said.  \u201cStorage is becoming very tight. Logistics are becoming tight,\u201d Woods said, forecasting widespread oil-well \u201cshut-ins across the industry.\u201d  It delayed an investment decision to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique and some spending in offshore Guyana, where it has made one of the world\u2019s largest oil discoveries in years. Current operations in Guyana are not affected, it said.  IMPACT ON RESULTS EXPECTED  First-quarter results, due out May 1, will be hurt by an earnings drop of about $1.4 billion in oil and gas, and about $800 million in refining, both compared with the fourth quarter, the company said. Chemical earnings will swing to a profit of about $100 million, according to figures released on Tuesday.  Exxon had set an ambitious growth plan two years ago to revive earnings and output, and Woods reiterated the company\u2019s belief that global demand for oil would grow.  \u201cPopulations and energy demand will continue to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy will rebound despite the shocks from the pandemic.\u201d  Exxon\u2019s 30% cut in spending exceeds that of oil majors\u2019 BP PLC, Chevron Corp, Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Saudi Aramco, which have made 20%-25% reductions. BP and Chevron also cut deeply into their shale oil businesses.  The nine major oil companies have slashed a combined $38 billion, or 22%, from their initial 2020 spending plans for $175 billion. Overall, oil companies have cut $54 billion in planned project investments.  The U.S. oil major\u2019s shares surged nearly 5% to $42.44 in late morning trading.  Exxon\u2019s market value has slumped 42% this year as the oil-price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia has taken a toll on the energy sector. However, its stock has been a laggard for years, dropping 54% over the last five years compared with an 18% gain in the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 stock index.","616":"MELBOURNE\/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N said on Wednesday it is assessing worldwide job cuts as the global coronavirus pandemic slices into fuel demand, with the largest U.S. oil company announcing voluntary layoffs in Australia in the latest in a wave of cost cutting.  Exxon and other oil majors are axing jobs spurred by a historic collapse in fuel demand because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Exxon\u2019s job cuts will continue globally into 2021, with Australia the first country outside the United States where it has completed a review of its businesses, according to a person familiar with the process.  Prior to the pandemic, Chief Executive Darren Woods pursued an ambitious spending plan to boost oil output and turn around sagging profits on a bet that a growing global middle class would demand more of its products.  However, the company has instead slashed capital spending by 30% this year and warned of deeper cuts in 2021, as it tries to defend a dividend paying nearly 9%. Exxon in July delivered the first back-to-back quarterly losses in at least 36 years.  \u201cWe have evaluations underway on a country-by-country basis to assess possible additional efficiencies to right-size our business and make it stronger for the future,\u201d spokesman Casey Norton, said in emailed comments to Reuters.  Exxon initially said it had no plans for layoffs due to the pandemic, but on its latest earnings call on July 31, Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said that given reduced activity, it was evaluating its workforce requirements and looking at reductions \u201cbusiness by business and country by country.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  In Australia, Exxon said on Wednesday it had completed a review of its current and future project work in the country and was seeking volunteers to quit the company.  \u201cThis program will ensure the company manages through these unprecedented market conditions,\u201d it said in a statement.  The company did not say what percentage of its workforce it was seeking to cut, but said in Australia it would consider all employees who expressed an interest in voluntary redundancy.  \u201cUntil other study work is complete, it would be premature to draw conclusions for other countries,\u201d Norton said.  In the United States, professional employees went through evaluations, with those ranked in the bottom category given 30 days to decide if they want to try to meet their manager\u2019s goals or leave the company.  Exxon changed the system late last year so that more workers might land in that bottom category, with 8% to 10% of employees going through the process, up from 3% last year.  Employees can choose to leave with 90 days pay or are given 90 days to improve. The 30-day decision window is closing for many workers, so some are starting to leave Exxon, according to a person familiar with the evaluations.  The layoffs in Australia come as Exxon is looking to sell its 50% stake in the Bass Strait oil and gas joint venture, which analysts have estimated could fetch up to $3 billion.  Analysts have speculated it could also sell or close its Altona plant in Melbourne, Australia\u2019s oldest refinery.","617":"May 27 (Reuters) - Shareholder activists targeting Exxon Mobil Corp\u2019s climate policies stepped up a campaign to split the chairman and chief executive\u2019s roles ahead of the oil major\u2019s shareholder meeting on Wednesday.  Unlike European rivals, Exxon faces little government pressure to curb greenhouse emissions or strike deals with climate activists. Under CEO Darren Woods, Exxon blocked six climate resolutions from this year\u2019s ballot, encouraging activists to seek the split.  \u201cWe have done a lot of one-on-one conversations,\u201d said Liz Gordon, executive director for corporate governance at the New York State Comptroller\u2019s office, one of several groups co-sponsoring the independent chairman proposal.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern about the company and its direction,\u201d she said, declining to predict the outcome of the vote. Influential proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services this year recommended a vote again the measure.  Exxon has taken steps to bolster its defenses by granting its lead director increased authority to pre-review board agendas and to meet with top shareholders. The proposal last year received nearly 41% of the vote, up from 38.7% in 2018.  The company has declined to comment on the efforts, but pointed to filings that note shareholders \u201cderive significant benefits\u201d from the combined roles under Woods.  Top Exxon holders\u2019 Vanguard Group, BlackRock Inc and State Street Corp also declined to comment on how they plan to vote on the measure or climate-related proposals on the proxy. The three combined own about 20% of Exxon shares.  BlackRock this year signed on to the Climate Action 100+ investor group seeking carbon emissions curbs.  \u201cBlackRock faces ridicule if it used its vote to undermine Climate 100 backed proposals, and were satisfied with largely cosmetic changes to the lead director\u2019s role at Exxon,\u201d said Eli Kasargod-Staub, executive director at advocacy group Majority Action.

FILE PHOTO: A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Sergio Moraes  Irving, Texas-based Exxon entered talks with Algeria\u2019s national oil company Sonatrach several months ago to develop a field in the southwestern Ahnet basin, the sources close to the discussions said.  The talks were part of a deepening of ties between the two companies that followed Sonatrach\u2019s acquisition last May of Exxon\u2019s Augusta refinery in Sicily, Italy.  Last week, officials from the two sides held talks in Houston, Texas to hammer out details but Exxon opted to suspend the discussions, temporarily at least, due to the wave of protests in Algeria over President Abdelaziz Bouteflika\u2019s 20-year rule, the sources said.  Exxon and Sonatrach declined to comment.  The refinery acquisition and increased cooperation between the two companies were seen as key for Sonatrach\u2019s efforts to modernize its business and reduce reliance on fuel imports under Chief Executive Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour.  The collapse of the talks follows years of attempts by Sonatrach to attract foreign companies to develop its vast oil and natural gas resources.  Bouteflika had appointed Kaddour in March 2017 to turn around a state company hit by fraud scandals, lethargy and red tape. He has since then managed to rebuild ties with oil majors, some of which had shunned Algeria previously due to tough terms and bureaucracy.  But Kaddour\u2019s fate is tied to Bouteflika, who has been facing increasing pressure to step down from street protests, energy and political sources say.  Kaddour was previously jailed in a murky power struggle typical for Algeria before being rehabilitated by Bouteflika.  \u201cThe minute Bouteflika would leave power, Ould Kaddour would be sacked,\u201d a reliable source familiar with the matter told Reuters last month.  Sonatrach hopes to tap foreign experience in fracking, a drilling technique that led to the rapid expansion of U.S. oil and gas production, to develop its own shale reserves, estimated at 22 trillion cubic meters, the world\u2019s third largest.  Algeria is a leading gas supplier to Europe but exports have suffered from delays to several projects and a steep rise in the use of subsidized gas at home as the population has grown.  To make Algeria attractive for investors, Kaddour, a U.S.-trained engineer, has also resolved a series of disputes with oil majors including France\u2019s Total, Italy\u2019s ENI and Spain\u2019s Repsol that had blocked investments.  He has also been pushing the government to finalize energy legislation that has been in the works for years to offer better terms for investors.","619":"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Rosneft ROSN.MM and U.S. ExxonMobil XOM.N plan to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in a consortium with Indian and Japanese partners, spreading the estimated $15 billion cost, two sources familiar with the talks said.  Logos of ExxonMobil are seen in its booth at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan April 4, 2017. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai  The four companies - Rosneft, Exxon, Japan's SODECO and India's ONGC Videsh ONGC.NSONVI.NS - are partners in the Sakhalin-1 group of fields that will supply the gas, but Exxon and Rosneft had initially planned to build the LNG plant without the other consortium members.  As well as spreading the costs among more stakeholders, the broader involvement of the participants may mitigate sanctions risk.  Initially, Rosneft and Exxon unveiled their joint plans to build an LNG production site in Russia\u2019s Far East to President Vladimir Putin in 2013.  But production of the super-cooled, seaborne gas has so far failed to materialize for many reasons, including international sanctions against Moscow for its role in the Ukraine conflict.  LNG production itself is not subject to sanctions, but Russian companies have limited access to financial markets due to the restrictions. Exxon had to leave most of its other new joint projects with Rosneft due to the West\u2019s punitive measures against Moscow.  Two sources - one person close to Exxon, and a high-ranking Rosneft executive not authorized to speak publicly - said both firms are committed to carrying out the LNG plant project within the framework of the Sakhalin-1 agreement.  Sakhalin-1, a hydrocarbon project, is led by Exxon with a 30 percent stake. Twenty percent belongs to Rosneft, with the rest split between SODECO (30 percent) and ONGC Videsh (20 percent).  \u201cNo one is interested in financing such a project alone,\u201d the source close to Exxon said. Asked how the LNG plant deal would be structured, the senior Rosneft executive said: \u201cIt will be Sakhalin-1.\u201d  The sources did not say how the financing of the LNG plant would be shared between the participants.  The source close to Exxon said a decision whether to go ahead with the LNG project was expected in 2019, otherwise the project risked losing its market amid growing competition.  Currently, two LNG plants, Novatek's NVTK.MM Yamal LNG and Gazprom's GAZP.MM Sakhalin-2, are producing the frozen gas in Russia, which has set an ambitious target of more than doubling its global LNG market share to 20 percent in the next decade.  Sakhalin-1 is pumping close to 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, a record high, as well as natural gas that it has been unable to sell abroad. Gazprom has the exclusive rights to export pipeline gas from Russia.  Sakhalin-1 has to pump most of the gas back into the ground, while a small amount goes to local customers in the sparsely populated region. Decade-long talks with Gazprom and the consortium over gas sales have not yet yielded any results.  Rosneft, ONGC and SODECO declined to comment. The Russian Energy Ministry and the government also declined to make any immediate comment.  \u201cThe Sakhalin-1 consortium continues to explore every opportunity to monetize Sakhalin-1 gas resources,\u201d an ExxonMobil spokeswoman in Moscow said in emailed comments sent in response to Reuters questions.  SITE LOCATION  Igor Sechin, Rosneft chief executive, said in June that the LNG plant would be built just across the Tatarsky strait in the port of De Kastri in Russia\u2019s Khabarovsk region, where Rosneft already has an export terminal for Sakhalin-1 oil.  Sechin said then that the plant\u2019s annual capacity was seen at 6 million tonnes of LNG, with supplies aimed at starting in 2025. Gazprom\u2019s Sakhalin-2 has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes.  The source close to Exxon confirmed the technical plans for the plant and said the project partners are considering the option of laying a gas pipe along the existing oil pipeline from Sakhalin-1 to the LNG plant in De Kastri.","620":"(Adds comment from ExxonMobil)  SINGAPORE, April 16 (Reuters) - A liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker has left Papua New Guinea laden with the first export cargo of the supercooled fuel since the country\u2019s giant LNG project resumed production after a major earthquake triggered a shutdown in February, Thomson Reuters Eikon shiptracking data showed on Monday.  The tanker\u2019s destination wasn\u2019t immediately clear, but the resumption of shipments could put pressure on spot LNG prices, traders said.  ExxonMobil Corp restarted output at the project near the capital Port Moresby a fortnight ahead of schedule, its Australian partners said late last week.  \u201cWe confirm an LNG cargo has been loaded onto the Kumul tanker,\u201d a spokeswoman from ExxonMobil told Reuters in an email reply.

The Kumul unloaded an LNG cargo at the PNG terminal on April 4. It was anchored nearby until April 14, before loading the cargo from the terminal on April 15, the data showed.  ExxonMobil had said in early April that it had imported an LNG cargo to the project\u2019s terminal in order ensure tanks at the PNG facilities remained cold.

The row was over oil \u201ccross-flows\u201d from Northern Chayvo oilfield, controlled by Rosneft.  Sakhalin-1, off Russia\u2019s Pacific Ocean coast, is operated by Exxon Neftegaz Ltd, through which ExxonMobil owns 30 percent in the project. Rosneft and ONGC control 20 percent each. Japanese consortium Sodeco owns 30 percent.  ONGC\u2019s Verma said production at Sakhalin-1 reached 250,000 barrels per day (bpd), up from some 200,000 bpd, as Russia had lifted output restrictions as part of a global deal with OPEC.  Russia\u2019s total oil production hit a post-Soviet high of 11.347 million barrels per day this month.  The dispute between Rosneft and the Sakhalin-1 consortium unfolded against the background of a wider rift between Russia and the United States over what Washington called Moscow\u2019s meddling in a 2016 presidential election.  Exxon had to quit some joint projects with Rosneft, including developing Arctic oil and gas, over sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States.

The company reported a net annual loss of $22.4 billion for 2020, on the write down and losses in oil production and refining, compared with a full-year profit of $14.34 billion in 2019.  Exxon shares rose 2% to $45.80% at market open.  OILMAN JOINS BOARD  The company remains under fire from environmentalists and activist investors pushing for a board overhaul and a strategy to transition to cleaner fuels. Exxon pushed back against their calls for clean energy expertise, naming the former head of Malaysia\u2019s state oil company, Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, to its board. It is in discussions with other candidates, the company added.  Other oil majors posted losses for the year as pandemic-related travel restrictions cut fuel demand and triggered huge writedowns. Rivals BP and Chevron posted annual losses.  Royal Dutch Shell reports financial results Thursday.  Exxon posted a net loss of $20.2 billion, or $4.70 per share, in the fourth-quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $5.69 billion, or $1.33 per share, a year ago.

Exploration and production, Exxon\u2019s largest business, lost $18.5 billion in the fourth quarter on the natural gas asset impairments, compared with a profit of $6.1 billion the year prior.  Its chemicals business earned $691 million on better margins in part from lower oil prices, up from a loss of $355 million a year ago. Refining lost $1.2 billion, compared with profit of $898 million last year, on weak margins and lower output as the pandemic limited global travel.  The writedown lays bare the size of the miscalculation that the company made in 2010 when it paid $30 billion for U.S. shale oil and gas producer XTO Energy.

REUTERS\/Stringer \/File Photo  The deal would give QP, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG), a 30 percent share in two of Exxon\u2019s local affiliates in Argentina - ExxonMobil Exploration Argentina S.R.L. and Mobil Argentina S.A., which holds rights with other partners for seven blocks, QP said in a statement.  \u201cThis is an important milestone, as it marks Qatar Petroleum\u2019s first investment in Argentina as well as its first significant international investment in unconventional oil and gas resources,\u201d QP\u2019s Chief Executive Saad Al-Kaabi said in the statement.  The agreements were signed by Al-Kaabi, and Andrew Swiger, senior vice president at Exxon Mobil Corp., in Doha.  The announcement did not disclose the value of the investment.  The blocks, in Vaca Muerta in the onshore Neuqu\u00e9n basin in Argentina, are under \u201cunconventional exploration licenses with active drilling plans as well as exploitation licenses with pilot drilling and production,\u201d QP said.  The deal between QP and Exxon comes as the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil producer looks to rapidly expand its upstream operations under Chief Executive Darren Woods, who inherited a portfolio with relatively few international growth operations compared to peers.  Exxon has been investing heavily in its U.S. shale operations and in Guyana, though its development in Argentina has been slow due to a host of factors, including the geographic remoteness of the country from U.S. shale operations as well as government price controls for natural gas.  By bringing in QP as a partner, Exxon cuts its financial risk and also pushes the project forward.  For QP, the deal offers a chance to invest for the first time in a sizeable shale operation while avoiding the public relations difficulties that would have likely arisen had it invested in shale operations in the United States, where public sentiment still sees Qatar and other OPEC members as economic competitors.  It would also help Qatar guarantee long-term access to gas assets abroad, when decades from now its own gas reserves could start depleting.  For Qatar it also signals its ability to sign big multi-billion-dollar deals with oil majors despite a prolonged regional political crisis and pressure on governments and companies by other Gulf neighbors to reduce ties with Doha.  Last year, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, along with Egypt imposed a political and economic boycott on Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism, which Doha denies.  In May, the International Petroleum Technology Conference decided to move its 2020 IPTC event which was due to be held in Doha, to Dhahran in Saudi Arabia, prompting Al-Kaabi to instruct heads of QP\u2019s subsidiaries and joint ventures to cut all ties with the organization, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.  The deal with Exxon appears as a show of strength by QP as the boycott continues.  \u201cThis agreement... goes hand in hand with the planned expansion of our local production from the North Field, which will further boost Qatar\u2019s leading global position by raising its LNG production from 77 million to 100 million tons per year,\u201d Al-Kaabi said.  \u201cOur oil and gas sector has not been impacted by the blockade, nor has our previously planned expansion.\u201d","627":"LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil XOM.N is considering a sale of its assets in the British North Sea after more than 50 years in the oil and gas basin as it focuses on U.S. shale production and new projects.  FILE PHOTO: An Exxon gas station is seen in Houston, Texas, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Loren Elliott\/File Photo  The world\u2019s largest publicly traded energy company has held talks with a number of North Sea operators in recent weeks to gauge interest in some or all of its assets, which could fetch up to $2 billion, according to three industry sources with knowledge of the matter.  Exxon declined to comment.  Leaving the British North Sea would mark a major retreat from Europe for Irving, Texas-headquartered Exxon, which has already put its Norwegian offshore assets on the block.  It would follow similar moves by U.S. rivals Chevron and ConocoPhillips which earlier this year sold the bulk of their North Sea operations.  Most of Exxon's operations are managed through a 50-50 joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, known as Esso Exploration and Production UK, and include interests in nearly 40 oil and gas fields.  Shell declined to comment.  Exxon produces around 80,000 barrels of oil and 441 million cubic feet of gas a day in the British North Sea, according to its website.  Potential buyers could include large private equity-backed North Sea producers such as Chrysaor or Neptune which have acquired portfolios from veteran producers in recent years.  Assigning a value to oil and gas assets in the North Sea is complicated because many fields and infrastructure are nearing the end of their lives and require dismantling, or decommissioning, an expensive process which can offset years of production revenue.  Neivan Boroujerdi, North Sea analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said an Exxon exit was expected, valuing it at around $2 billion.  \u201cCombined with its Norwegian assets, which ExxonMobil recently announced its intention to market, could see the supermajor reach one-third of the way to meeting its $15 billion divestment target,\u201d Boroujerdi said.  Exxon\u2019s UK business \u201cis attractive. It is highly cash generative, with operating costs around half of the UK average.\u201d  The North Sea has seen a revival in production in recent years due to new fields coming on line and improved performance by operators following the 2014 oil price collapse.  Still, the basin\u2019s production is expected to decline over the next decade, according to the UK Oil and Gas Authority.  Should the direct discussions with potential buyers not yield a result, Exxon will consider appointing an external bank to run a formal sale process, two of the sources added.  It was unclear if a sale of assets would require breaking up the Esso joint venture.  Esso has been producing gas since 1968 and oil since 1976, including from the Brent field, which is eponymous with the global crude benchmark and is now being decommissioned.  Exxon\u2019s operational focal point in recent years has turned to the United States, where it is rapidly ramping up oil production in the Permian Basin, as well as in Guyana, where it is developing huge, untapped fields.","628":"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N said on Thursday it could cut its global workforce by about 15%, including deep white-collar staff reductions in the United States, as the COVID-19 pandemic batters energy demand and prices.

An estimated 14,000 employees globally, or 15%, could lose jobs, including contractors, spokesman Casey Norton said. The figure will include loses from restructurings, retirements and performance-based exits. Exxon had about 88,300 workers, including 13,300 contractors, at the end of last year.  The company is not targeting a fixed number of jobs but does expect the result of its ongoing business review to eliminate about 15% of its current staffing.  Exxon, which has struggled in recent years to regain footing after misplaced bets on shale gas and Russia exploration, lost nearly $1.7 billion in the first six months of the year. It is expected to report a record-setting third straight quarterly loss on Friday, and its third-quarter loss could reach $1.19 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.  Exxon said the 1,900 U.S. job cuts will come mainly from its Houston-area campus, the headquarters for its U.S. oil and gas businesses.  Earlier this month, Exxon said it would cut 1,600 jobs in Europe. It has announced cuts in Australia.  Exxon shares were trading 4% higher at $32.85 on Thursday.  Prior to the pandemic, Chief Executive Darren Woods pursued an ambitious spending plan to boost oil output in the belief a growing global middle class would demand more of its products.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L and BP Plc BP.L also have outlined up to 15% workforce cuts. Chevron Corp\u2019s CVX.N planned cuts of 10%-15% would imply a reduction of between 4,500 and 6,750 jobs.

The company this year began disclosing quarter-to-quarter comparisons of prices, taxes and refining margins to deliver information on its businesses to investors soon after a quarter ends.  The consensus estimate prior to Tuesday\u2019s filing was for profit of 86 cents per share, according to Refinitiv Eikon. But after Exxon signaled weaker oil prices and chemicals margins, several brokerage houses cut their earnings forecasts.  Edward Jones lowered its per share estimate to 65 cents from 85 cents previously. Mizuho also cut its forecast to 65 cents, from $1.04 and slashed its full year projection to $2.86 a share from $3.27. Exxon earned $1.46 a share in the year-earlier third quarter.  Exxon shares were down 2.6% to $67.18 in mid-day trading.  \u201cWe expect the company to continue to outspend its cash flow as it invests heavily over the next few years,\u201d said Jennifer Rowland, an equity analyst with Edward Jones.

The project is being jointly developed with Rosneft using gas from the Sakhalin-1 venture which will be chilled into liquid to underpin the LNG plant\u2019s initial annual output target of 6 million tonnes.  Western sanctions forced Exxon to exit some joint ventures with Rosneft in late February, but LNG is not part of the sanctions. The Russian company said the move would not affect the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas production-sharing JV struck in the mid-1990s.  \u201cThe Sakhalin-1 consortium continues to explore every opportunity to monetize Sakhalin-1 gas resources,\u201d Exxon spokeswoman Julie King said.  \u201cA liquefied natural gas plant is an option to maximize benefits to the consortium and the Russian state and its citizens,\u201d she added.

Chinese engineering companies, banks and shipyards are all muscling into LNG, typically the preserve of Western, Japanese and South Korean players, as government coal-to-gas switching policies make LNG an increasingly strategic fuel.  For example, Chinese investment is pouring into African floating LNG projects, import terminals, tankers and traditional land-based plants such as the $12 billion invested in Russia\u2019s Yamal facility, used to skirt Western sanctions.  Loans in turn drum up business for Chinese engineering firms and shipyards in LNG, and give state-backed companies the upper hand in supply negotiations.  It is unclear if Chinese lenders will help finance Far East LNG.  The bid deadline for EPC contractors is September 30, sources said.

The production and storage vessel at the offshore Liza field has storage capacity of 1.6 million barrels, he said.  A drop in oil consumption due to the coronavirus outbreak has led to oversupply and a price collapse, just as a consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp ramps up production at Liza, where Guyana began producing crude for the first time in its history in December.  Exxon operates the Stabroek block, which includes the Liza field, in a consortium with Hess Corp and China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd.

Kaddour, a U.S.-trained engineer, who took office last year to overhaul Sonatrach plagued by contract disputes with foreign firms, red tape, stagnant production and corruption scandals.  OPEC member Algeria and a major gas supplier to Europe, has been hit hard by a slump in world oil prices and has struggled to attract energy investment to help develop new fields and increase existing production.  In December, Sonatrach said it planned to work more closely with France\u2019s Total on offshore, petrochemical, solar energy and shale exploration projects after settling disputes over profit-sharing on oil and gas contracts.  Algeria remains dependent on oil and gas earnings, which provide 60 percent of the state budget, and Sonatrach\u2019s performance is key to the health of the economy.

REUTERS\/Jessica Rinaldi  The largest U.S. oil and gas producer this month told workers in Texas and New Jersey to accept contract offers because they would not find other jobs. In California, Exxon rejected a request to delay a property deal, arguing business could proceed normally despite the pandemic, and threatened to keep the buyer\u2019s down payment when it asked for more time due to the lockdown.  Exxon said it has not used the pandemic to enhance its bargaining position.  \u201cWe reject these unwarranted claims and any assertions to the contrary are baseless and without merit,\u201d said Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler.  Exxon is known as a tough negotiator. But the coronavirus has provided new talking points during contract disputes, unions said.  \u201cThey said, \u2018Take a look out there. If you strike or we lock you out, there are no jobs out there,\u2019\u201d said Ricky Brooks, the head of a United Steelworkers local that represents about 800 refinery, chemical plant and laboratory workers at an Exxon facility in Baytown, Texas.  In New Jersey, negotiators representing employees at Exxon\u2019s Paulsboro Lube Oil Manufacturing plant were told the same thing, said an Independent Oil Workers union member who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly.  \u201cExxon has blatantly and intentionally leveraged COVID-19 as a means to get what they want,\u201d said USW official Brooks.  The company offered Baytown union workers 3.5% and 4% annual raises in the first two years of a three-year contract, said Brooks. The union workers in the refinery and laboratory rejected the deal because Exxon proposed new workers wait 4-1\/2 years to achieve pay parity with other workers. It now takes four years.  Philip Hilder, a former federal prosecutor who has faced Exxon in negotiations, said the company has \u201cthe ability to wear down their opponents financially and mentally\u201d using its deep pockets to avoid settling. The approach, which he described as \u201ca take-no-prisoners\u2019 view of litigation\u201d is designed to deter opponents and win any contest.  Exxon lawyers this month threatened to cancel a California property deal and keep the down payment when a buyer invoked force majeure to postpone a closing date due to the pandemic. Force majeure clauses are common in the energy industry as a way to suspend contracts during natural and man-man disasters.  The prospective buyer, Pacific Collective LLC, had sought to delay the $4.2 million purchase of the site of a former service station until county, Culver City and Los Angeles\u2019 stay-at-home directives were lifted.  Exxon on Wednesday filed to move the developer\u2019s breach of contract lawsuit to a federal court.  \u201cThere are no conditions to closing that exist in the Agreement that cannot be met,\u201d Exxon wrote in a filing submitted to Los Angeles County Superior Court, noting that property permits, inspections and transfers were essential businesses and able to operate.  \u201cThe Title Company has also confirmed that, at this time, it is able to close the transaction,\u201d they added.","642":"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Middle East crude benchmarks rose on Friday with DME Oman\u2019s premium posting a more significant jump than cash Dubai.

Output at the Liza field, which Exxon operates in a consortium with Hess Corp and CNOOC Ltd, has fallen to between 25,000-30,000 barrels per day within the past week after an issue with gas reinjection equipment, according to Vincent Adams, head of Guyana\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency.  That was down from between 75,000-80,000 bpd in early May, when authorities had anticipated that output from the field - which began production in December, raising hopes for increased prosperity in the impoverished country - would rise to 120,000 bpd by June.  Without the compressor fully functioning in order to reinject gas produced alongside the crude into the reservoir, Exxon had to reduce crude output to avoid exceeding a 15 million-cubic feet per day limit agreed to with authorities for gas flaring, Adams said.  Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Oil companies worldwide are seeking to reduce gas flaring from their operations in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But that is complicated in places like Guyana, which lack gas pipeline infrastructure.  Plans to build a gas pipeline from Guyana\u2019s offshore Stabroek block to the coast have not yet gotten off the ground.","644":"(Reuters) - Spanish oil giant Repsol SA is in advanced talks to acquire some deepwater assets in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico from Exxon Mobil Corp for about $1 billion, three people familiar with the matter said on Monday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The deal would be a boon to Exxon\u2019s plans to accelerate asset sales, as it seeks to raise cash to return to shareholders and fund major projects. Suppressed oil prices have weighed on the appetite of oil majors to buy such assets.  There is no certainty a deal will be agreed, the sources said. The transaction would require approval from partners in the assets, who may have preferential rights to buy them, said two of the sources.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Representatives for Exxon and Repsol declined to comment.  Exxon began the process to jettison Gulf of Mexico assets last year with advice from JPMorgan Chase & Co, Reuters reported last October.  According to a document seen by Reuters dated Fall\/Winter 2018, Exxon was marketing nine assets. These included its 50% stake in the large Julia oil field, which it operates, as well a 9.4% piece of the Heidelberg field and 23% of the Lucius oil and gas field, both of which are now operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp.  The exact number of assets that Exxon would sell to Repsol could not be learned.  The Irving, Texas-based company is trimming its portfolio to focus on promising acreage in offshore areas such as Guyana and Brazil, and onshore in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. This includes in the Gulf of Mexico, once considered a reliable basin for oil exploration and production.  Exxon\u2019s Chief Executive Darren Woods said earlier this year the company was targeting $15 billion through 2021 from asset sales, although securing divestments has been difficult at a time when many oil developers, especially in the United States, are eschewing purchases to focus on existing portfolios.  However, the world\u2019s largest publicly traded energy company said last week it was in exclusive talks with Var Energi in relation to Exxon\u2019s Norwegian upstream assets, confirming a Reuters story that the duo were close to a $4 billion deal.","645":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Weaker crude oil and gas prices drove quarterly results sharply lower at Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, pushing down shares at the two largest U.S. oil producers and signaling a weak start to the new year.

Fourth-quarter results at Exxon XOM.N fell below Wall Street's recently lowered estimate, with earnings sliding to $5.6 billion from $6 billion a year ago. Per share profit excluding one-time gain from asset sales was 41 cents, below Wall Street's estimate of 43 cents.  Chevron CVX.N swung to a loss of $6.61 billion from a year-earlier profit of $3.73 billion. The company had $10 billion in charges including writedowns on the value of oil and gas properties that were no longer economic to pump. Excluding charges, its $1.49 cent a share profit topped estimates.  This week, Royal Dutch Shell's shares hit a three-year low after it laid out a plan to pull back on share buybacks amid slower global growth. BP PLC BP.L and Total SA TOTF.PA report financial results next week.  Exxon CEO Darren Woods said its natural gas, refining and chemicals businesses have suffered from prices near or at decade lows.

REUTERS\/Carlos Jasso\/File Photo  HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Thursday its oil and gas reserves surged 19 percent last year, thanks to growth in U.S. shale, the United Arab Emirates and Guyana, with a portfolio large enough to pump for the next 14 years at least.  The reserve update, which is required annually by U.S. regulators, comes as Exxon faces concerns about its growth potential and spending after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly profit last week.  Exxon said it added 2.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) to its proved reserves last year, bringing the total to 21.2 billion boe. Proved reserves are those that are considered economically and geologically feasible to produce in the near future.  \u201cExxon Mobil\u2019s portfolio of development opportunities positions us to grow shareholder value as we bring on new supplies of oil and natural gas to meet growing demand,\u201d Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a statement.  Exxon\u2019s stock fell about 0.3 percent to $76.69 in morning trading as oil prices and the broader market dipped slightly.[O\/R]  In Texas, where Exxon is headquartered, the company paid more than $6 billion last year to double its acreage in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield. That shale deal added more than 800 million boe to reserves, the company said.  Exxon added another 800 million boe to its reserves from operations in the United Arab Emirates\u2019s Upper Zakum field.  In Guyana, where Exxon, Hess Corp and other partners have yet to pump oil, the company said it and partners have found recoverable resources, including proved reserves and other resources, estimated to be 3.2 billion boe.  In 2016, Exxon had cut its proved reserves by 3.3 billion boe, mostly due to writedowns in the value of its Canadian oil sands assets amid low oil prices.  Oil prices rebounded in 2017, making some of those assets profitable again. Exxon said about 900 million boe in its portfolio now qualify as proved reserves under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Guidelines.  Exxon also said it added 9.8 billion boe to its resource base last year. The metric is effectively the company\u2019s estimate of how much oil and natural gas exist in acreage that it holds, whether or not the commodities are commercially viable.  The company has been holding talks with a range of countries for expansion opportunities. Late last year Reuters reported that Exxon and Egypt had been holding investment discussions.","650":"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N is in talks with Qatar over a possible deal that could see the country investing in the company's U.S. shale gas resources, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Qatar\u2019s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani is set to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Wednesday.  The shale revolution in the United States has not only seen a huge rise in crude production, but also in gas output. Exxon, already the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer, said earlier this year it is aiming to triple production in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2025.  For Qatar, which is locked in a dispute with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, the move could help broaden its investments outside the Middle East.  Qatar is one of the smallest producers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and also one of the most influential players in the global LNG market due to its annual production of 77 million tonnes, cementing its position as the world\u2019s largest LNG supplier.

Chevron reported its refining and chemical profits fell 65 percent.  Both reported top-line figures that missed Wall Street expectations and were lower than year-ago levels due to weaker crude pricing.

Exxon continued to spend heavily to boost output, with capital spending up 42 percent over a year ago as it poured new investment into its shale and offshore operations. Investors have been pressing oil companies to cut back on spending and increase returns to shareholders.  Its first-quarter profit fell to $2.35 billion, or 55 cents a share, from $4.65 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year ago.

A logo of Exxon Mobil is displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled Attorney General Maura Healey had jurisdiction to seek records to probe whether the oil company\u2019s marketing or sale of fossil fuel products violated the state\u2019s consumer protection law.  The ruling marked another setback for Exxon after a federal judge in March dismissed a related lawsuit it filed seeking to block investigations by Healey and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, both of whom are Democrats.  Exxon argued that because it is incorporated in Texas and New Jersey, Healey had no basis to issue a demand for documents in 2016 to conduct a Massachusetts-based investigation of whether it misled consumers and investors.  But Justice Elspeth Cypher, writing for a 6-0 court, said jurisdiction existed because of Exxon\u2019s control over advertising conducted for about 300 franchise gas stations operating under the Exxon and Mobil brands in Massachusetts.  She said Healey\u2019s probe related to how manmade greenhouse gas emissions had caused climate change, \u201ca distinctly modern threat that grows more serious with time, and the effects of which are already being felt in Massachusetts.\u201d  Healey said she hoped Exxon would now turn over documents it has fought hard against disclosing, showing what it knew about climate change and when it knew it.  \u201cI hope this decision will encourage Exxon to end their scorched earth campaign,\u201d she said.  Scott Silvestri, a spokesman for Exxon, said the company was considering its next steps.  Healey and Schneiderman launched their investigations following news reports in 2015 saying Exxon\u2019s own scientists determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.  Those reports by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon contended that the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.  Exxon has called the investigations politically motivated and in a separate lawsuit filed in federal court claimed that Schneiderman and Healey were conspiring to \u201csilence and intimidate one side of the public policy debate.\u201d  But U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan dismissed that case in March, rejecting as \u201cimplausible\u201d Exxons\u2019 claim Healey and Schneiderman were pursuing bad faith investigations in order to violate its constitutional rights.","659":"Jan 23 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil:  * EXXONMOBIL AND RENEWABLE ENERGY GROUP PARTNER WITH CLARIANT TO ADVANCE CELLULOSIC BIOFUEL RESEARCH  * CO AND RENEWABLE ENERGY GROUP SIGNED A JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT WITH CLARIANT TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL USE OF CELLULOSIC SUGARS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","660":"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has hired former BP crude oil trader Ruddin Dhilawala, to further boost its trading capabilities in Singapore, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.

In a report here published Monday, London-based anti-corruption group Global Witness said the U.S. oil major's 40-year deal to produce crude in the offshore Stabroek block would deprive the government of up to $55 billion in revenue over the life of the contract, compared with deals in other countries.  The discovery of more than 8 billion barrels of oil and gas offshore Guyana by an Exxon-led consortium, which includes Hess Corp and China\u2019s CNOOC, will transform the economy of the poor South American country.  With fewer than 800,000 inhabitants, the former British colony is seen as a test for whether oil revenue can spur sustainable development in a country lacking strong institutions.  Global Witness\u2019 finding could boost the opposition People\u2019s Progressive Party\u2019s (PPP) contention that President David Granger\u2019s government was too generous in a 2016 contract re-negotiation with the consortium, which resulted in a 2% royalty and a 50% profit share for the state.  The group had previously sent individuals named in the report summaries, and before publication Granger\u2019s allies sought to limit damage ahead of the March 2 election, which will decide which party oversees the first five years of an oil boom.  \u201cYou have to decide whether you are going to be fooled a couple of days before the elections by some set of jokers,\u201d Foreign Secretary Carl Greenidge said last week at a rally in the eastern town of New Amsterdam for Granger\u2019s APNU-AFC coalition, calling Global Witness a \u201cvery controversial NGO.\u201d  Global Witness said 52% of oil revenues would flow to state coffers in Guyana, below the 65%-85% range it said International Monetary Fund (IMF) surveys showed was \u201cnormal.\u201d It said Guyana would receive $168 billion over the life of the deal, rather than the $223 billion it considered fair.  A 2012 IMF paper here found government shares of oil revenues tended to fall in that range, and policies raising less \"may be cause for concern.\" A 2019 IMF report here on Guyana said the country's macroeconomic outlook was \"very favorable\" and that oil revenues would improve infrastructure and development.  The government and Exxon both argue favorable fiscal terms were needed to attract investment into an unproven oil play, but the PPP and Global Witness say the government had the upper hand during the 2016 re-negotiation given that Exxon made commercial discoveries in 2015.  \u201cThe conclusions are misleading in that they compare Guyana deep water with mature hydrocarbon-producing provinces which naturally have evolved fiscal frameworks reflecting maturity and lower risk profiles,\u201d Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said of the report.  \u2018WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE MONEYS\u2019  To be sure, it is unlikely the election will spur changes to the Exxon deal, as the PPP has stopped short of saying it would renegotiate the contract terms. Hess Chief Executive John Hess said in an investor call last week that both parties were \u201cpretty clear\u201d they would honor the deal.  But the PPP has pledged to improve \u201ccontract administration\u201d by requiring Exxon hire more local firms, and promises to re-examine deals with other companies. Opposition leader Bharrat Jagdeo slammed Greenidge\u2019s comments and said the government \u201csold out our interests.\u201d  \u201cThis is very worrying, that Carl Greenidge will go on an APNU platform in New Amsterdam and try to run down a global organization that tackles corruption, and they talk about clean government and honest government?\u201d Jagdeo, a former president, told reporters last Thursday.  Finance Minister Winston Jordan said Exxon\u2019s discovery of oil before the renegotiation of the original agreement - signed during PPP leadership in 1999 - was not the only factor that should be taken into account.  The country has a century-long border dispute with neighboring Venezuela, and in 2013 Venezuela\u2019s navy seized a ship exploring for oil on behalf of U.S. oil company Anadarko. That incident added risk, Jordan said. Venezuela in late 2018 halted an Exxon ship conducting a seismic survey.  \u201cWe can compare today, tomorrow, about what we got and what we didn\u2019t get, but it seems we don\u2019t want to compare objective conditions,\u201d Jordan said in a late January interview.  Global Witness said in its report it did not believe the Venezuela dispute \u201ccan be used to adequately justify the exploitative nature of Exxon\u2019s Stabroek deal.\u201d  Guyana will receive $280 million-$300 million in oil revenues this year, Jordan said. By comparison, total government revenue in 2018 was just $1 billion.  \u201cMore energy should be put into what do we do with the moneys,\u201d he said. \u201cThat discussion has to take precedence.\u201d (Reporting by Luc Cohen and Neil Marks in Georgetown Additional reporting by Gary McWilliams in Houston Editing by Leslie Adler)","669":"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell announced on Monday plans to limit leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, across its oil and gas operations as it tries to sharply curb carbon emissions.

Larger rival Exxon Mobil announced in May plans to reduce methane emissions by 15 percent by 2020.  Methane is released into the atmosphere mostly from the burning of excess gas, known as flaring, as well as through leaks in gas infrastructure such as wells, pumps and pipelines.  The gas has a bigger greenhouse impact than carbon dioxide, even though the oil and gas industry produces less methane and the gas also has a shorter lifetime.  The methane target will be measured against a baseline leak rate, which is currently estimated at range from 0.01 percent to 0.8 percent across the company\u2019s oil and gas assets, it said.  The Anglo-Dutch company set out last year an ambitious plan to halve its carbon emissions by 2050, far exceeding rivals. Investors have called on the company to set binding targets to reach those goals.  Climate change and emissions, caused by burning fossil fuels, have moved to the forefront of discussions between energy companies and investors since the signing of the 2015 U.N.-backed Paris climate agreement that seeks to curb emissions to zero by the end of the century in order to limit global warming.  \u201cThe race to near-zero methane emissions is on,\u201d said Ben Ratner, director at Environmental Defense Fund, U.S-based non-profit climate advocacy.  \u201cCompany leadership on methane does not stop with setting targets.

The General Commander of Mozambique\u2019s police, Bernardino Rafael, said that the insurgents attacked Mocimboa da Praia and its army barracks before dawn on Monday, wounding dozens of people.  Mocimboa da Praia is about 350 km (220 miles) by road from the city of Pemba in Mozambique\u2019s northernmost province of Cabo Delgado and is just south of the Afungi peninsula, where gas projects worth $60 billion are located.  The town was until recently the main airport for workers travelling to the site, until a landing strip was built at Afungi itself, and its port is also used for some cargo deliveries for the projects.  \u201cMocimboa da Praia is currently an active combat zone,\u201d Rafael told reporters at the police headquarters in Maputo.  The army was doing all it could to restore security and warning people to stay away, he said.  The insurgents started staging attacks in Cabo Delgado in 2017, threatening security in a nation set to become a global gas exporter following one of the biggest gas finds in a decade offshore of the province.  Little is known about the insurgents, though initial attacks were claimed by a group known as Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama. More recently, Islamic State has claimed a number of attacks.  More than 900 people have been reported killed in the province since 2017, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project, an NGO.  The frequency of attacks has been increasing, leaving some analysts concerned that the insurgency could be a growing threat and that it could cause disrupt the projects.  Alexandre Raymakers, Senior Africa Analyst at global risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said the attack highlighted serious gaps in security and raised questions about Mozambique\u2019s ability to defend the developments.  While Raymakers said the LNG infrastructure and personnel will remain \u201caspirational targets\u201d for now, the insurgents will likely be emboldened by their successes and seek to increase the tempo of their operations.  Exxon and Total did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","681":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's XOM.N $200 million write-down last month on abandoned ventures in Russia - once its next big frontier - points to challenges facing Chief Executive Darren Woods in his second year leading the world's largest publicly traded oil producer.  Some of the biggest bets taken by his predecessor Rex Tillerson, now the U.S. secretary of state, have resulted in billions of dollars in write-downs amid falling production and a stock price that has long lagged peers.  That leaves Woods facing the prospect of slow growth and billions of dollars in new spending that could weigh on results for years. In 2018, the company plans capital spending of about $24 billion - up about a quarter since 2016 - suggesting return on capital will get worse before it gets better as the firm waits for a payoff from new exploration under Woods.  Graphic on Exxon's Quarterly Earnings: tmsnrt.rs\/1WQwElC  Rivals including Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Chevron CVX.N, by contrast, have capped or cut their spending after finishing expansion projects. Exxon shares are down 18 percent since Woods took over in January 2017. Shell is up 2 percent and Chevron is down about 3 percent during the same period.  Woods is feeling the heat from investors who could have made more if they held shares in Exxon\u2019s rivals, as well as activist investors who want to see the company take renewable energy more seriously. Analysts are pushing for more transparency on operations, and some have called for Woods to sell assets.  Graphic on Exxon's Cash Stumble: reut.rs\/2Ey6S1s  Exxon declined to comment. A State Department spokesperson said Tillerson would have no comment on Exxon matters and referred questions to the company.  Exxon is set to host its annual analyst meeting in New York on Wednesday.  The firm took the $200 million after-tax charge to walk away from its Russia Kara and Black sea ventures with Rosneft ROSN.MM. Five years ago, Exxon touted plans to spend more than $3 billion in Russia, but the firm halted operations in late 2014 when the U.S. sanctioned the country over its military operations in Ukraine.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Exxon also took $1.3 billion in charges against Tillerson\u2019s bets on natural gas in Mexico and Canada this year. Last year, it took a $2.13 billion write-down a year earlier - mostly on Rocky Mountain properties tied to Tillerson\u2019s 2010 purchase of natural gas producer XTO Energy Inc. - and disclosed it had reduced estimates of Canadian oil reserves by 3.5 billion barrels.  \u201cThere\u2019s no question that, over the past handful of years, Exxon has been a relative underperformer,\u201d said Hank Smith, co-chief investment officer of the Haverford Trust, which has held Exxon\u2019s shares for two decades and recently added Royal Dutch Shell to its portfolio. \u201cIt\u2019s been frustrating.\u201d  \u2018EPIC FAIL\u2019  Weak results from production have this year cost Exxon its standing as the oil major generating the most cash, a distinction that now goes to Shell.  Now, Exxon is spending more cash on projects that will take time to produce.  In Guyana, where the company is leading development of an offshore field estimated to hold at least 3.2 billion barrels of oil, Exxon and partners have said they must spend more than $4 billion on developing a project not expected to deliver oil until at least late 2019.  More spending awaits Exxon in Qatar, Mozambique and Papua New Guinea for liquefied natural gas projects, and for oil developments in Brazil, Ghana and Mauritania, the company has said.  Exxon paid more than $6 billion last year to double its acreage in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield. Exxon\u2019s production there so far is relatively low compared to peers, about 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Exxon says it plans to triple output there through 2025.  With all Woods\u2019 development plans, it seems unlikely Exxon\u2019s capital spending will decline after this year, said Simmons & Co analyst Guy Baber.  The company did reverse some of the write-downs it took on reserves as oil prices rose. But the company\u2019s inability to translate those gains into robust profits in the final quarter of 2017 was an \u201cepic fail,\u201d said Raymond James oil analyst Pavel Molchanov.  LITTLE DATA FOR INVESTORS  Some investors say it\u2019s too soon to evaluate Woods\u2019 tenure despite Exxon\u2019s lagging returns.  \"There are few decisions that any one person, let alone Woods, could make in the first 12 to 13 months that would be able to really affect the company,\" said Mark Stoeckle, portfolio manager of Adams Natural Resources Fund Inc PEO.N, which holds Exxon's shares.  Exxon retains supporters on Wall Street. Its shares are recommended for purchase by 29 percent of the 24 analysts that cover the company, according to Thomson Reuters data. Half rate the shares as a \u201chold\u201d and five advise \u201csell.\u201d  Analysts recommending the stock cite the strength of Exxon\u2019s assets.  Others, however, want more information on Exxon's operations. Of the world's five largest publicly traded oil producers, Exxon ranks last for providing detailed data to investors, while BP Plc BP.L is the best, according to an analysis of quarterly earnings regulatory filings by investment researcher Redburn Ltd.  BP and Shell, for example, offer more than twice as much data as Exxon on each segment of operations, Redburn found.  \u201cExxon Mobil\u2019s greatest challenge for 2018 might not its valuation, assets or growth, but opening up to investors,\u201d said Redburn oil and gas analyst Rob West.","682":"JOHANNESBURG\/PARIS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Total TOTF.PA have asked Mozambique to send more troops to guard their operations in the far north after a surge of attacks by Islamist militants, an industry source and two security consultants said.

Mozambique\u2019s government communications department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment outside usual business hours, while calls to the department and ministry of defense went unanswered  Total declined to comment on whether it had requested an increase in troops, but said the safety of its employees was paramount.  \u201cWe continue to monitor conditions closely and work with the relevant authorities and other stakeholders to provide a safe and secure working environment for our workforce and local communities,\u201d it said it a statement.  The militants called themselves Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama when they started launching attacks in 2017. More recently, Islamic State has claimed responsibility via its media outlets, though there has been no independent confirmation of a link.  The fighters - who tout their brand of Islam as an antidote to what they describe as a corrupt ruling elite - have been stepping up operations in Cabo Delgado, analysts say.  There are concerns they might also be moving south after an assault in the district of Quissanga last week.  One of the security consultants said the oil and gas companies were no longer satisfied with the security provided, and were requesting more support in response to a changing threat.","683":"(Reuters) - A proposed expansion of an Exxon Mobil Corp oil refinery could be impacted by the Trump administration\u2019s plan to place a 25 percent tariff on imported steel, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.

FILE PHOTO: An Exxon gas station is seen in Houston, Texas, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Loren Elliott\/File Photo  Exxon has fended off past challenges seeking big change to its policies and leadership. But faltering returns - its shares are off 40% in the last five years and losses through September have reached $2.37 billion - could swing more holders behind the activist, say investors and analysts.  Engine No. 1, a week-old, $250 million California-based firm, has called for expanded spending and pay cuts, a board shake-up and shift to cleaner fuels. Its views are supported by California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (CalSTRS), the Church of England, and echoed in part by hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which has $50 billion under management.  \u201cManagement and board members regularly engage with our shareholders on a range of topics and value their constructive perspectives,\u201d but they do not share details of such conversations, Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said.  The company supports the Paris Agreement on climate change, is working to reduce emissions and has been \u201cencouraged by feedback\u201d on recent plans to improve performance and returns, he added.  \u201cThis firm is not making a climate change argument but a financial argument, saying your performance is terrible,\u201d said sustainability expert Robert Eccles, a professor at Said Business School at Oxford University. \u201cThe world is moving against Exxon, and I think the activists can win this.\u201d  For CalSTRS, the second-largest U.S. pension fund with $255 billion in assets, its support of Engine No. 1 mirrors an earlier union, when it backed hedge fund Jana Partners in a successful push for Apple to add parental controls to its phones.  Charles Penner, a former Jana partner who is spearheading the battle and has known CalSTRS for years, won its backing by arguing Exxon\u2019s spending and dismissive attitude toward climate issues cost it investor support, a person familiar with his thinking said.  He also wanted to make a statement with the challenge to Exxon, considering it is the biggest and worst performer among its peers, the person said.  \u201cThis is not about the size of your stake but about the value and credibility of your argument,\u201d said Aeisha Mastagni, an investment officer at CalSTRS. \u201cThis is a company that needs change inside the boardroom.\u201d  While Exxon\u2019s board is diverse, having female and minority directors, it needs energy industry experts such as Engine No. 1\u2019s candidates, she said.  The Church of England, which brought climate-related and management change proposals to Exxon holders in the past, lent its support to Engine No. 1\u2019s pitch on Thursday.  New York state\u2019s $226 billion pension fund, which has joined Church of England shareholder proposals in the past, said this week it would start pulling money out of oil and gas companies whose business plans do not align with the Paris climate accord.  And D.E. Shaw sent its own letter with criticisms to Exxon.  \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising someone is pushing for change because it has been underperforming Chevron and peers for a long time. To the extent D.E. Shaw can accelerate this process, I would say it\u2019s positive and should be helpful to shareholders,\u201d said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.  D.E. Shaw declined to comment.  Engine No. 1 owns about $40 million in Exxon shares, a fraction of the $12 billion that Exxon\u2019s top investor Vanguard Group,oversees. To some, that miniscule holding might put it at a disadvantage in waging a proxy contest that can costs $20 million. Exxon is valued at $184 billion and its share price has climbed to $43.46 this week.  But some analysts believe the fund may have found its match in Exxon.  \u201cYou can win proxy contests with very small stakes and the way you do it is by using your opponent\u2019s weight against him,\u201d said a person who advises companies against activists but could not be publicly identified.","686":"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell widened its lead over Exxon Mobil as king of cash among the world\u2019s top oil and gas companies last year but its U.S. rival could catch up with its investment drive in new production.

A sharp drop in crude prices in the last quarter of 2018 to below $50 a barrel from a four-year high of $86 a barrel in October was a bleak reminder of the uncertainty.  But stronger than expected results in the fourth quarter of 2018 reported over the past week gave the sector a boost as companies surprised investors with their resilience to generate profit, or breakeven, at oil prices around $50 a barrel.

The company, still the biggest energy firm in terms of production and market size, was slow to respond to the drop in crude prices, lagging rivals when they slashed costs, sacked employees and sold assets in the past three years.  But under Chief Executive Darren Woods, who succeeded Rex Tillerson when he became U.S. secretary of state from 2017 until last year, Exxon is undergoing profound changes in its operations and structure in an effort to catch up.

Anglo-Dutch Shell is still set to retain the crown for cash generation until the end of the decade thanks to rising production and its dominance in liquefied natural gas (LNG).  But Exxon\u2019s new production should sharply narrow the gap, according to estimates by HSBC, which has a \u2018hold\u2019 rating on Shell and \u2018buy\u2019 on Exxon.  While Exxon invests heavily into future production, Shell\u2019s output growth is set to slow after years of gains following the acquisition of rival BG Group in 2016.  For Shell and other rivals which have held back on new investments, the race to find new reserves to replace depleting fields will be a key challenge, said Darren Sissons, portfolio manager at Canadian investment management firm Campbell, Lee & Ross.  \u201cThe trade off of balance sheet and reduced exploration and production (E&P) and capital expenditure has worked to strengthen balance sheets with the cost being reserve life deterioration,\u201d Sissons said.  \u201cThe next wave of E&P was largely started tepidly last year by Exxon and BP but all the others have now joined in.\u201d","687":"* Oil, gas law change could impact LNG expansion  * Mining law change deals with lapsed leases  * PM Marape says PNG just wants fair share (Adds Exxon comment in paragraph 9)  MELBOURNE, June 11 (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea has passed legislation seeking to boost benefits to the country from oil, gas and mine developments, which could impact talks on a stalled project planned by Exxon Mobil Corp.  Prime Minister James Marape came to power a year ago on a platform to lift the country out of poverty by getting a bigger share of wealth from the country\u2019s energy and minerals. His government this week secured an emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund.  The country would not break legitimate exploration or development contracts or agreements, Marape said in a posting on his Facebook page after the legislation was passed on Wednesday.  \u201cI can assure our investors that we know they must make money for their shareholders too, so we will not be greedy, but we (are) just asking for a fair share, if they want to harvest our resources,\u201d Marape wrote.

FILE PHOTO: A logo of Exxon Mobil is displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  An expansion has been under consideration since at least 2014. A go-ahead would signal Exxon\u2019s confidence in U.S. shale production and in global demand for gasoline and other fuels.  Exxon continues to evaluate increasing its North American light crude refining, but has not made any decisions, spokeswoman Sarah Nordin said on Wednesday. \u201cThe Beaumont refinery is being considered as part of that evaluation,\u201d she said.  Chief Executive Darren Woods last month said that Exxon was considering investing $50 billion in the United States over the next five years.  The company has been weighing putting in a third crude distillation unit (CDU) at the 362,300 barrel-per-day refinery. To top Motiva Enterprises\u2019 [MOTIV.UL] Port Arthur, Texas, plant, now the largest, Exxon would have to add the capacity to process another 300,000 bpd and 400,000 bpd.  CDUs do the primary refining of crude oil and provide the feedstock for units that produce gasoline, diesel and other products.  Motiva\u2019s Port Arthur refinery can process as much as 635,000 bpd of crude oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  One of the sources, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the deliberations, said the company was still calculating the size of the new CDU.  \u201cThey\u2019re still crunching the numbers,\u201d the source said.  Exxon has considered the total capacity for an expanded Beaumont refinery at between 700,000 and 850,000 bpd.  In 2016, Exxon added 20,000 bpd in light crude refining capacity at Beaumont.  A new expansion will take advantage of the growth in U.S. shale production, which is expected to about double the nation\u2019s oil output to more than 11 million bpd later this year, from 5.6 million bpd in 2011, according to the EIA.  Nordin said any expansion would take place between 2019 and 2022 within the 2,000-acre Beaumont site where the refinery and an adjoining chemical plant are located to \u201cminimize environmental impact.\u201d  The project, if approved, would create up to 1,850 construction jobs and between 40 and 60 permanent jobs upon completion, Nordin said.  \u201cThe expanded unit would enhance the Beaumont refinery\u2019s competitive position and establish it as a leader in the North American refining industry,\u201d she said.","689":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp\u2019s Baytown, Texas, chemical plant returned to normal operations on Tuesday after a malfunction in the polypropylene production area, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Several oil companies posted billions of dollars in losses in 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic brought global travel to a standstill, slashing fuel demand and sending crude prices to historic lows.  The sector is also under pressure from investors and pension funds demanding companies to disclose their carbon footprint and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by investing in renewable energy projects.  While companies including Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have announced steps to tackle climate change, S&P said it does not see those \u201cproviding material credit differentiation\u201d.

S&P has a \u2018stable\u2019 outlook on Chevron, widely considered to have the best restraint on spending. ExxonMobil\u2019s outlook is negative, meaning the ratings agency could downgrade its profile again.  Exxon last year slashed spending on new projects by nearly a third and outlined plans to cut up to 15% of its workforce, but its debt rose by $21 billion due to expenses and restructuring.

Oil prices are down over 20% this year and natural gas prices have touched their lowest in decades, as fears of the economic impact of the coronavirus dent short-term demand.  The long-term industry outlook too is clouded by a push toward cleaner fuel and pressure from investors for higher returns.  Exxon\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said the company would spend between $30 billion and $35 billion a year through 2025 and forecast $33 billion in capital expenditure this year.  On Tuesday, Exxon\u2019s closest U.S.-rival Chevron showed off its own war chest by highlighting it has up to $80 billion that it could use for shareholder returns over the next five years regardless of the price that oil trades at.

FILE PHOTO: Logos of ExxonMobil are seen in its booth at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan April 4, 2017. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai\/File Photo  On Friday, the company reported its U.S. refining and marketing business earned $310 million last quarter, less than half the $695 million in the same period in 2018. Its overall downstream profit fell to $451 million versus $724 million in 2018.  Outages at three refineries, including Exxon\u2019s Baytown, Texas, plant reduced overall profits by $150 million in the June quarter, the company said. Baytown resumed normal operations but two others - in Canada and in Saudi Arabia - are expected to remain at reduced levels through year-end, officials said.  The production losses \u201care not systemic to our overall performance,\u201d Exxon Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said in a conference call, describing the three outages as isolated.  Exxon has forecast higher than usual maintenance at its refineries this year as it prepares for a shipping industry shift to low sulfur fuels. In April, it said second quarter planned downtime would be similar to the first.  A fire this week that struck a plastics unit at its Baytown chemical plant also temporarily reduced production at the adjacent refinery, said people familiar with the matter.  During the second quarter of this year, the company\u2019s U.S. crude distillation unit (CDU) outages cost it 16.4 million barrels of lost production, compared to 9.65 million barrels in the second quarter of 2018, according to Reuters calculations. The totals reflect the capacity of each shut unit and the number of lost production days.  CDUs do the initial breakdown of crude oil coming into a refinery, providing feedstocks for all other units in the refinery and producing unfinished motor fuels.  During the second quarter of this year the 238,000 bpd CDU at Exxon\u2019s Joliet, Illinois, refinery was shut for nearly two months as part of extensive multi-unit overhaul. That outage accounted for about three-quarters of Exxon\u2019s lost CDU production last quarter.  The next largest amount of lost production was at the Baytown refinery when another CDU was shut for eight days in June because of heavy rainfall. That same plant a year earlier undertook a 47-day overhaul of another CDU that hurt output.","695":"A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018.

The International Energy Agency has forecast high-sulfur fuel oil demand to fall 60 percent next year, while marine gasoil demand to more than double.  Exxon\u2019s forecast comes as its refining business is struggling to find enough heavy crude to make fuel oil and other distillates, in the face of U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan crude.  Heavy crude accounts for nearly two-thirds of U.S. oil imports. Of this, Venezuela\u2019s oil accounted for 10 percent of heavy crude imports in 2018 and about 13 percent in 2017, according to U.S. Energy Department figures.

Oil pump jacks work at sunset near Midland, Texas, U.S. August 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Jessica Lutz  It is now in a race with Exxon Mobil XOM.N to be the first to pump a million barrels of shale oil a day from the field in the U.S. southwest, using a strategy that depends on a host of partners sharing their expertise and their output.  Chevron's joint venture with Cimarex Energy XEC.N, one of the few Permian operators that has been consistently profitable since late 2016, is well known.  But it also has dozens of other agreements with companies including Concho Resources CXO.N, Devon Energy DVN.N, EOG Resources EOG.N, and even arch-rivals Exxon and Occidental Petroleum OXY.N, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.  \u201cWe\u2019re partners with all of the great operators,\u201d said Scott Neal, a Chevron exploration executive. He declined to name any partners, besides Cimarex. Concho, Devon, EOG, Occidental and Exxon declined to comment.  Chevron\u2019s deals, ranging from large-scale joint ventures to small deals where it has leased land to other operators, give it a share of the oil its partners produce.  They also provide data from thousands of wells stretching back years, allowing Chevron to hone drilling strategies. In return, partners get access to areas adjacent to their wells and pipelines, reducing their costs.  Shale drilling has helped the United States reverse decades of declines in output to become the world\u2019s largest oil producer and all the major U.S. oil companies have jumped on the shale bandwagon to boost their own production.  Unlike conventional oil fields, however, shale wells decline quickly, producing most of their oil in the first few years, so fields such as the Permian Basin require constant, and costly, drilling just to keep production steady.  \u201cIf there\u2019s a downside, that\u2019s the downside,\u201d said Jeff Gustavson, who oversees Chevron\u2019s Permian operations. \u201cYou\u2019re always having to put more in.\u201d  LONGER WELLS  At a site near Midland, Texas, know-how gleaned from Cimarex and other partners is helping Chevron drill a series of ultra-deep wells - named after the mythical three-headed hound Cerberus - to reach an oil-rich layer more than a mile underground.  The alliances and vast land holdings Chevron can tap allow it to drill longer wells than some rivals, giving it an edge as long wells generally pump more oil and save money.  Slideshow ( 23 images )  Chevron said its Permian wells average nearly 9,000 feet (2,743 meters) this year, while consultancy Wood Mackenzie said the industry average is 8,500 feet. Next year, its wells will stretch almost 10,000 feet on average.  In one formation near Midland, Chevron\u2019s peak average production rate runs at 760 barrels per day (bpd) for each well while rivals are producing at 705 bpd, according to IHS Markit.  Shale drilling combines horizontal wells with hydraulic fracturing, the process of pumping water, sand and chemicals at high pressure to crack rocks that hold oil and gas.  Those wells and partnerships in the Permian, the fastest growing shale field, are critical to Chevron\u2019s future.  It missed the first phase of the shale boom early this decade but reversed course in 2014 when it drilled its first horizontal well in Permian and embarked on an investment spree to try to become the world\u2019s largest shale oil producer.  It has been shedding assets in the North Sea, Africa and Asia and expects to sell up to another $10 billion worth of properties to focus on projects including the Permian, where it has controlled some of the best and cheapest acreage since the 1920s.  Those holdings helped lift Chevron\u2019s oil and gas output to a record high in the second quarter. In the Permian, output leapt 56% from a year earlier to 421,000 bpd and Chevron\u2019s goal is to pump 900,000 bpd from the oilfield by 2023.  Chevron\u2019s Gustavson said its long-standing relationships provide it with \u201call of the data, all of the cost information\u201d from wells across the basin. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge advantage. Huge.\u201d  For a chart of the top Permian drillers:  MINERAL RIGHTS  Chevron is not the only energy company claiming a unique position in the Permian Basin.  Occidental outbid Chevron for Anadarko Petroleum in a takeover battle this year, spending $38 billion and vowing to use its technology to squeeze more oil from the deal which gave it a combined 3 million Permian acres.  Exxon, meanwhile, spent $6.6 billion two years ago to buy more Permian land and is now running nearly three times more rigs than Chevron in a race to reach its target of producing 1 million bpd of shale by 2024.  But Chevron has two key advantages: it holds 2.2 million Permian acres, second only to the Occidental-Anadarko trove, and it owns mineral rights on much of its land so it doesn\u2019t pay the 20%-25% production royalties most rivals face.  Chevron\u2019s Permian oil and gas output last quarter was second to Occidental\u2019s 533,000 bpd, but rising faster. Exxon is in the top 10 with production of 274,000 bpd.  For a chart of the top Permian land holders:  Chevron\u2019s mineral rights reduce its breakeven, or the oil price it needs to make a profit, while other savings come from drilling ventures. Chevron operates 20 rigs, far fewer than the 56 Exxon operated in June and Occidental-Anadarko\u2019s 27.  But Chevron estimates its partners contributed the equivalent of another seven to 10 rigs.  Cimarex struck a small deal with Chevron in 2009 to drill on its land and share data, and then broadened the agreement in 2013, said Michael DeShazer, Permian manager at Cimarex.  He said the two companies were able to learn faster, deploy faster and, by sharing resources, they could more easily invest in infrastructure such as pipelines, roads and electricity.  Shale output drops sharply the first year and declines 80% to 90% over two to three years, but Chevron has been able to slow the decrease.  In the formation near Midland, Chevron\u2019s wells lost 52% of their output after the first 12 months compared with an average decline of 70% for rivals, according to IHS Markit. Output from Chevron\u2019s wells in the first two years was also 40% higher.  While most shale firms have spent heavily but failed to deliver the returns demanded by investors, Chevron\u2019s \u201cslow and steady\u201d approach to the Permian is welcomed by investor Matrix Asset Advisors, which holds 55,000 Chevron shares.  \u201cThey\u2019ve got a game plan. They\u2019re executing on the plan,\u201d said Matrix President David Katz.","699":"Dec 10 (Reuters) - U.S. producers Exxon Mobil Corp and Hess Corp plan to export the first-ever shipments of crude oil from Guyana between January and February, a milestone for Latin America\u2019s newest oil producer, sources with knowledge of the plans said.
