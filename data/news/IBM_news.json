FILE PHOTO: A man stands near an IBM logo at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 25, 2019. REUTERS\/Sergio Perez\/File Photo  Supply chain management involves overseeing the flow of goods and services, such as tracking the movement and storage of raw materials, inventory, and finished goods. It has been identified as one area that can benefit from blockchain technology, a shared database maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.  Technology research firm Gartner Inc said by 2023, blockchain will support the global movement and tracking of $2 trillion of goods and services annually.  The new blockchain network is called Trust Your Supplier and alongside IBM, the other founding participants were Anheuser-Busch InBev, Cisco, GlaxoSmithKline, Lenovo, Nokia, Schneider Electric and Vodafone.  Chainyard, a blockchain specialist firm, is providing the technology and building the network using IBM\u2019s blockchain platform. The other companies, meanwhile, are putting their supplier data onto the network and contributing their expertise to expand the network.  Traditional methods of managing suppliers often involve cumbersome manual processes, which make it difficult to verify identities and track documents such as ISO certifications, bank account information, tax certifications, and certificates of insurance, IBM said.  By using a decentralized approach and an immutable audit trail built on blockchain, the company said the new network would eliminate manual time consuming processes and help reduce the risk of fraud and errors.  \u201cThe validation and onboarding of new suppliers is a critical pain point for virtually any company that relies on a robust supply chain to conduct business,\u201d Marie Wieck, general manager for IBM Blockchain, said in an email to Reuters.  \u201cBy moving this process onto the blockchain, we\u2019re taking much of that burden and shifting it to the network, where it can be shared in real-time more securely and efficiently.\u201d  Wieck said IBM\u2019s own procurement organization projects a 70 to 80 percent reduction in the time it takes to get new suppliers onboard and an estimated 50 percent reduction in administrative costs within its own business.  IBM has 18,500 suppliers around the world and said it will begin using the Trust Your Supplier network, initially bringing onboard 4,000 of its own North American suppliers over the next few months. The blockchain has limited availability with existing participants and is scheduled to be commercially launched in the third quarter of 2019.","2":"(Reuters) - IBM Corp missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Thursday, hurt by a rare sales decline in its software unit as clients shied away from longer-term deals due to pandemic-induced economic uncertainty.  The 109-year-old firm is preparing to split itself into two public companies and the namesake firm will focus on the so-called hybrid cloud, where companies use a combination of their own datacenters and leased resources to manage and process data.  Revenue from its cloud-computing business rose 10% to a record $7.5 billion in the fourth quarter, with IBM saying it is confident of returning to sales growth in 2021 and expected revenue to grow in mid-single digits after the separation.  That was not enough to convince investors, however, as the company\u2019s shares dropped 6.7% to $122.98 in extended trading after IBM\u2019s fourth consecutive quarter of sales decline.  \u201cOur performance reflects the fact that our clients continue to deal with the effects of the pandemic and broader uncertainty of the macro environment,\u201d said Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna, who took helm last April.  \u201cThis puts additional pressure on larger software transactions this quarter and project delays in some services engagements.\u201d  Sales from cloud and cognitive, which houses IBM\u2019s software offerings and its biggest unit, declined 4.5% to $6.8 billion after two years of growth.

The company will stop offering facial recognition software and opposes any use of such technology for purposes of mass surveillance and racial profiling, Krishna said, who also called for new federal rules to hold police more accountable for misconduct.  IBM did not explain the timing of its decision to exit facial recognition development but Krishna told lawmakers \u201cnow is the time to begin a national dialogue on whether and how facial recognition technology should be employed by domestic law enforcement agencies.\u201d  The announcement came as the United States grapples with nationwide protests over the death of a black man, George Floyd, under police custody in Minneapolis, and rising calls for police reform.  \u201cIBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms,\u201d Krishna wrote, adding \u201ctechnology can increase transparency and help police protect communities but must not promote discrimination or racial injustice.\u201d  Government officials across the country have proposed reforms to address police brutality and racial injustice aimed at boosting oversight of law enforcement agencies.

Brahmawar, a former IBM executive who was hired last year, has launched a strategy overhaul and plans 20-30 million in net new investments this year to revitalize the 50-year-old company based in the western German city of Darmstadt.  Earlier, Software AG reported a 1 percent decline in fourth-quarter revenues and flat operating profits, and guided towards weaker margins this year, sending its shares down by 7.9 percent. Sector sentiment was hit after Microsoft reported weaker cloud computing growth overnight.  Software AG is revamping its middleware division to focus on integrating data applications - whether they are on a cloud server or on devices at the \u2018edge\u2019 of networks - and strengthening its Cumulocity platform that can manage automated industrial production.  Brahmawar\u2019s strategy overhaul seeks to capitalize on the trend for companies to digitalize their operations.

He ruled out staff cuts after larger rival SAP said this week it would let go of more than 4 percent of its workforce as it seeks to accelerate its transition from running software on site to cloud-based servers.  Brahmawar has overhauled top management and is focusing marketing efforts on North America, Germany, Britain and France, as well as Japan and China in the Asia-Pacific region.

Underscoring the drive into high-margin businesses, IBM in October agreed to buy Red Hat, the company\u2019s biggest acquisition in its more than 100-year history.  Ginni Rometty, IBM chief executive since 2012, has steered the company toward faster-growing segments such as cloud, software and services and away from traditional hardware products, but not without a bumpy journey. The newer areas of focus have sometimes underwhelmed investors.  The company, which won approval for the purchase from EU regulators in late June and U.S. regulators in May, agreed to pay $190 a share for Red Hat, representing a 63 percent premium.  Founded in 1993, Red Hat specializes in Linux operating systems, the most popular type of open-source software and an alternative to proprietary software made by Microsoft Corp . IBM has faced years of revenue declines as it transitions from its legacy computer hardware business into new technology products and services. Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst and his management team will remain in place. Whitehurst will join IBM\u2019s senior management team and report to Rometty.  IBM will maintain Red Hat\u2019s headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, its facilities, brands and practices and said it operate as a distinct unit within IBM.  The companies said IBM and Red Hat will offer \u201ca next-generation hybrid multicloud platform\u201d that will be \u201cbased on open source technologies, such as Linux and Kubernetes.\u201d  IBM\u2019s cloud strategy has focused on helping companies stitch together multiple cloud platforms rather than compete head on with \u201chyperscale\u201d cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, a unit of Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.  IBM said Red Hat will continue \u201cto build and expand its partnerships, including those with major cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Alibaba.\u201d  Since 2013, IBM\u2019s cloud revenue as a percentage of total revenue has grown six-fold to 25 percent. In the 12 months through the first quarter of 2019, cloud revenue exceeded $19 billion.

The \u201cRome Call for AI Ethics\u201d asserts that the technology should respect privacy, work reliably and without bias, consider \u201cthe needs of all human beings\u201d and operate transparently - an area of ongoing research because AI systems\u2019 decisions are often inscrutable.  The document reflects growing interest among companies and institutions to set guardrails for the fast-evolving technology. Police have used facial recognition systems to investigate crimes, and Fortune 500 companies have used AI to vet job applicants - both examples of high-stakes tasks where deploying inaccurate or biased software could lead to harm.  The Vatican\u2019s initiative grew out of concerns that Pope Francis raised about AI and its effect on society more than a year ago, according to John Kelly III, executive vice president of IBM and one of the signatories.  \u201cHis major concerns were, will it be available to everyone, or is it going to further bifurcate the haves and the have-not\u2019s?\u201d Kelly told Reuters in an interview. Vatican officials also had concerns about AI displacing jobs and met with IBM in the United States at a research center in September, he said.  Pope Francis was due to receive the document Friday to conclude a conference that the Vatican\u2019s Pontifical Academy for Life hosted this week on AI ethics. Others participating included the European Parliament\u2019s President David Sassoli and Microsoft\u2019s President Brad Smith.  It was not immediately clear which other technology companies might sign on to the document going forward, or how signatories would implement the principles.  IBM for instance wants a doctor to be in the loop when its AI makes healthcare recommendations - something that may increase over time following a deal it announced this week with the Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children\u2019s Hospital in Rome. That partnership will focus on developing technology to speed up diagnosis and treatment of brain tumor patients.  Both IBM and Microsoft have said they turned down business when they felt uncomfortable with how a customer wanted to use their technology. Still, according to Kelly, about a third of the ethics questions IBM typically faces have no obvious answer.  \u201cGoing forward we\u2019re going to see more falling in that category, only because the technology is advancing so fast,\u201d he said.

REUTERS\/Brian Snyder  Armonk, New York-based IBM on Monday sued its former chief diversity officer, Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, who left for a similar job at Microsoft Corp MSFT.O. The lawsuit alleges McIntyre violated a one-year non-competition agreement and could disclose IBM's diversity data and hiring plans.  IBM\u2019s stance puts it at odds with trends in the tech industry and broader corporate world towards sharing diversity success stories and best practices, instead seeming to view diversity as a zero-sum game.  The lawsuit is unusual because IBM is arguing its diversity data and strategy are economically valuable \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d a legal term typically associated with closely guarded formulas like that for Coca-Cola. It appears to be the first company to bring such a lawsuit against a rival over diversity efforts, legal experts said.  IBM cited in its complaint McIntyre\u2019s knowledge and oversight of its plans to hire 50 diverse candidates to executive positions and its development of artificial intelligence-based tools to track the career development of women and minorities at the company.  According to IBM, knowledge of this \u201chighly confidential, proprietary, and competitively sensitive information\u201d would allow Microsoft to compete for the same talent and business from customers that value diversity.  Once synonymous with white men in dark suits, IBM created task forces in 1995 to address the issue and soon greatly increased the diversity of its management.  Y-Vonne Hutchinson, an Oakland, California-based diversity consultant and lawyer who works with the tech industry, said IBM has had a legitimate edge over its industry rivals when it comes to diversity.  IBM\u2019s tools for reaching it diversity goals could qualify as trade secrets if it can show they are valuable to competitors, said Villanova University law professor Michael Risch.  IBM said in a statement that it \u201chas a long history of being recognized for leadership in a diverse and inclusive workplace.\u201d  Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, which is not named in IBM\u2019s lawsuit, said it had no interest in IBM\u2019s confidential information.  \u2018PUBLIC CONDEMNATION\u2019  Russell Beck, a lawyer specializing in trade secrets law, said he was surprised to see IBM make such nakedly economic arguments about diversity, noting that corporations more typically cast their efforts as benefiting society as a whole.  Most large tech firms have long faced criticism for the lack of diversity of their staffs. IBM took a shot at Microsoft in its lawsuit, noting that the latter company has faced \u201cpublic condemnation and class action litigation\u201d for its struggles to recruit and promote women.  Microsoft is seeking to dismiss as without merit a class action alleging pay and promotion discrimination.  Microsoft and IBM both derive much of their revenue from selling software and cloud computing services to big companies, a number of which have said they seek diversity in their vendors and suppliers.  Other tech companies have previously argued for the confidentiality of diversity information, though more out of fear of public criticism and litigation than competition, said John Cary Sims, a professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California.  But more have recently embraced transparency. In 2014, Google released diversity data after previously trying to keep it private. Apple and Microsoft have also made their data public.  Joelle Emerson, a consultant who has advised Twitter Inc TWTR.N and Airbnb Inc on diversity efforts, criticized IBM's position.  \u201cIf you truly want to build a better industry, sharing learnings is actually a really helpful part of that,\u201d she said.  \u201cUltimately, a more diverse tech industry benefits every company within that industry.\u201d","31":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out a lower court ruling that allowed a lawsuit to proceed against managers of a retirement fund for IBM Corp employees centering on allegations that officials failed to disclose that IBM\u2019s microelectronics business was over-valued.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The justices sent the case back to the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for a further legal analysis. IBM is not a defendant in the lawsuit filed in New York federal court by plaintiffs who were participants in IBM\u2019s retirement plan.  IBM welcomed the ruling, company spokesman Douglas Shelton said.  \u201cThis case has important implications for businesses\u2019 ability to offer strong employee stock ownership plans and for employees, across all industries, to invest in their companies,\u201d Shelton said in a statement.  Participants in IBM\u2019s retirement plan have said that in 2013 the company\u2019s microelectronics division was incurring losses even though IBM said at the time it was valued at $2 billion.  The plaintiffs said the Retirement Plans Committee of IBM, which oversaw the fund, knew or should have known that the business was over-valued and made disclosures to lower the risk of an artificially high stock price and a painful correction once the problems in the unit were made public. The committee\u2019s members included senior IBM executives.  IBM sold the microelectronics business a year later at a significant loss, prompting a decline in the company\u2019s stock price. IBM paid GlobalFoundries Inc $1.5 billion to take over the money-losing unit and announced it would take a $2.4 billion write-down on the entire value of assets as well as $800 million of other unspecified costs. The company\u2019s stock price subsequently plummeted more than $12.00 per share, more than 7% of its value.  The plaintiffs sued the committee and its members in 2015. A federal judge dismissed the complaint in 2016. The 2nd Circuit in 2018 revived the litigation, prompting the retirement plan committee to appeal to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court, in an unsigned decision, unanimously said that some of the key arguments presented in the case must first be considered by the lower court.  The IBM dispute was a sequel to a 2014 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that a lawsuit brought by employees against Fifth Third Bancorp for putting company stock in its employment retirement plan ahead of the housing downturn could move forward.","32":"A man stands near an IBM logo at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 25, 2019.

Signs for Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. cover the facade of the New York Stock Exchange November 2, 2015. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The attacks were part of a Chinese campaign known as Cloudhopper, which the United States and Britain on Thursday said infected technology service providers in order to steal secrets from their clients.  While cybersecurity firms and government agencies have issued multiple warnings about the Cloudhopper threat since 2017, they have not disclosed the identity of technology companies whose networks were compromised.  International Business Machines Corp said it had no evidence that sensitive corporate data had been compromised. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) said it could not comment on the Cloudhopper campaign.  Businesses and governments are increasingly looking to technology companies known as managed service providers (MSPs) to remotely manage their information technology operations, including servers, storage, networking and help-desk support.  Cloudhopper targeted MSPs to access client networks and steal corporate secrets from companies around the globe, according to a U.S. federal indictment of two Chinese nationals unsealed on Thursday. Prosecutors did not identify any of the MSPs that were breached.  Both IBM and HPE declined to comment on the specific claims made by the sources.  \u201cIBM has been aware of the reported attacks and already has taken extensive counter-measures worldwide as part of our continuous efforts to protect the company and our clients against constantly evolving threats,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe take responsible stewardship of client data very seriously, and have no evidence that sensitive IBM or client data has been compromised by this threat.\u201d  HPE said in a statement that it had spun out a large managed-services business in a 2017 merger with Computer Sciences Corp that formed a new company, DXC Technology.  \u201cThe security of HPE customer data is our top priority,\u201d HPE said. \u201cWe are unable to comment on the specific details described in the indictment, but HPE\u2019s managed services provider business moved to DXC Technology in connection with HPE\u2019s divestiture of its Enterprise Services business in 2017.\u201d  DXC Technology declined to comment, saying in a statement that it does not comment on reports about specific cyber events and hacking groups.  Reuters was unable to confirm the names of other breached technology firms or identify any affected clients.  The sources, who were not authorized to comment on confidential information gleaned from investigations into the hacks, said that HPE and IBM were not the only prominent technology companies whose networks had been compromised by Cloudhopper.  Cloudhopper, which has been targeting technology services providers for several years, infiltrated the networks of HPE and IBM multiple times in breaches that lasted for weeks and months, according to another of the sources with knowledge of the matter.  IBM investigated an attack as recently as this summer, and HPE conducted a large breach investigation in early 2017, the source said.  The attackers were persistent, making it difficult to ensure that networks were safe, said another source.  IBM has dealt with some infections by installing new hard drives and fresh operating systems on infected computers, said the person familiar with the effort.  Cloudhopper attacks date back to at least 2014, according the indictment.  The indictment cited one case in which Cloudhopper compromised data of an MSP in New York state and clients in 12 countries including Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Britain and the United States. They were from industries including finance, electronics, medical equipment, biotechnology, automotive, mining, and oil and gas exploration.  One senior intelligence official, who declined to name any victims who were breached, said attacks on MSPs were a significant threat because they essentially turned technology companies into launchpads for hacks on clients.  \u201cBy gaining access to an MSP, you can in many cases gain access to any one of their customers,\u201d said the official. \u201cCall it the Walmart approach: If I needed to get 30 different items for my shopping list, I could go to 15 different stores or I could go to the one that has everything.\u201d  Representatives with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security declined to comment.

REUTERS\/Remo Casilli  The three said AI should respect privacy, work reliably and without bias, consider human rights and operate transparently.  Pope Francis, who has raised concerns about the uncontrolled spread of AI technologies, gave his backing in a speech read on his behalf at a conference attended by Microsoft president Brad Smith MSFT.O and IBM IBM.N Executive Vice President John Kelly. The pope is ill and could not deliver the address himself.  Calling for the ethical development of algorithms, known as \u201calgor-ethics\u201d, Francis warned about the dangers of AI being used to extract data for commercial or political ends, often without the knowledge of individuals.  \u201cThis asymmetry, by which a select few know everything about us while we know nothing about them, dulls critical thought and the conscious exercise of freedom,\u201d he said in his message.  \u201cInequalities expand enormously; knowledge and wealth accumulate in a few hands with grave risks for democratic societies,\u201d he said.  The joint document made a specific reference to the potential abuse of facial recognition technology.  \u201cNew forms of regulation must be encouraged to promote transparency and compliance with ethical principles, especially for advanced technologies that have a higher risk of impacting human rights, such as facial recognition,\u201d the document said.  Police have used facial recognition systems to investigate crimes, and Fortune 500 companies have used AI to vet job applicants - both examples of high-stakes tasks where deploying inaccurate or biased software could lead to harm.  It was not immediately clear whether other technology companies might sign up to the document, or how signatories would implement the principles.  IBM, for example, wants a doctor to be in the loop when its AI technology makes healthcare recommendations - something that may increase over time following a deal with the Vatican-owned Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children\u2019s Hospital in Rome.  That partnership will focus on developing technology to speed up diagnosis and treatment of brain tumor patients.  Both IBM and Microsoft have said they turned down business when they felt uncomfortable with how a customer wanted to use their technology.  The Rome conference was the latest example of the Vatican trying to stay ahead of the curve on technology and social issues in order to influence the pioneers of the future, regardless of their religion.  Vatican officials have said they could provide material for a possible papal document on AI, much as meetings with scientists helped shape the pope\u2019s landmark 2015 encyclical \u201cLaudato Si\u201d on the protection of the environment.

Every Federal Reserve policy maker backed raising interest rates last month, according to the September meeting minutes released on Wednesday.  The Fed hiked rates for the third time this year, and the display of unanimity at the meeting could bolster expectations the committee will raise rates again in December.

However, the company, which is wrapping up its $34 billion cloud deal for Linux software maker Red Hat Inc, guided 2019 free cash flow below analysts\u2019 expectation, adding to investor concerns following the deal, the company\u2019s biggest.  IBM said revenue slipped to $21.76 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, but came in above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $21.71 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company reported net income of $1.95 billion, or $2.15 per share, compared with a loss of $1.05 billion, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier.  IBM recorded a charge of $1.9 billion related to the U.S. tax overhaul in the latest reported quarter. The company took a $5.5 billion charge related to the tax reform in the year-ago quarter.  Excluding special items, the company earned $4.87 per share. Analysts had expected $4.82. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable.  IBM also forecast operating earnings for 2019 to be \u201cat least\u201d $13.90 per share, while analysts on average were expecting $13.79.  The company said it expects free cash flow of about $12 billion for the year, roughly in line with 2018. Analysts on average are expecting $12.67 billion for 2019.  Under Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rommetty, IBM has been refocusing toward faster-growing cloud and analytics services to lower its dependence on its traditional hardware products and reverse years of revenue declines  Underscoring that push, IBM in October agreed to buy Red Hat, a deal expected to close in the second half of the year.  The company is also shedding some of its legacy business as part of the shift. The company said in December it would sell some of its software products business to India\u2019s HCL Technologies for $1.80 billion.  IBM said its cloud business, part of what it refers to as \u201cstrategic imperatives\u201d, grew 12 percent to $19.2 billion in 2018.  The company\u2019s cognitive software business, which houses artificial intelligence platform Watson, analytics and cybersecurity services and is its second biggest, reported sales of $5.46 billion, compared with analysts\u2019 expectation of $5.25 billion.  IBM\u2019s revenue of $4.32 billion from its global businesses services segment also beat estimates of $4.15 billion.  The Armonk, New York-based technology services giant, which makes over 60 percent of its revenue from outside the United States, had warned in the third quarter that a strong dollar would hit its revenue.","53":"May 16 (Reuters) - Finjan Holdings Inc:  * FINJAN HOLDINGS - ON MAY 15, UNIT ENTERED INTO A PATENT ASSIGNMENT AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT WITH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION  * FINJAN HOLDINGS INC SAYS TERMS OF PATENT ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT ARE CONFIDENTIAL - SEC FILING  * FINJAN HOLDINGS INC - PURSUANT TO PATENT ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT, IBM ASSIGNED TO FINJAN BLUE 30 U.S. PATENTS, 11 RELATED INTERNATIONAL PATENTS  * FINJAN HOLDINGS - PURSUANT TO PATENT ASSIGNMENT DEAL, IBM ALSO ASSIGNED TO UNIT 1 EUROPEAN PENDING PATENT APPLICATION FOR UNDISCLOSED AMOUNT IN CASH Source text: (bit.ly\/2wJu4JX) Further company coverage:","54":"March 14 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp :  * EV GROUP AND IBM SIGN LICENSE AGREEMENT ON LASER DEBONDING TECHNOLOGY  * EV GROUP - PLANS TO INTEGRATE IBM\u2019S PATENTED HYBRID LASER RELEASE PROCESS INTO EVG\u2019S FIELD-PROVEN TEMPORARY BONDING AND DEBONDING EQUIPMENT SOLUTIONS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","55":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - IBM Corp IBM.N said on Friday the U.S. Commerce Department should adopt new controls to limit the export of facial recognition systems to repressive regimes that can be used to commit human rights violations.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  IBM is suing Groupon for $167 million, accusing it of infringing four basic internet technology patents, in a case that is being closely watched by the tech industry.  Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM has portrayed itself as an innovator whose licensing fee requests are reasonable in light of its research and development costs. But Groupon is defending itself by trying to portray IBM as using outdated patents to squeeze money out of other tech companies with threats of litigation.  \u201cIBM has approached every significant company in the web technology space asserting patents against them,\u201d Groupon lawyer J. David Hadden said during cross-examination of IBM licensing executive Thomas McBride in federal court.  \u201cIf someone comes to me and says \u2018pay me,\u2019 I would view that as a demand,\u201d Hadden said.  Two of the four patents in the case relate to Prodigy, IBM\u2019s late-1980s precursor to the web. IBM\u2019s patents describe commonplace internet technology like password management and online advertising.  McBride disputed Hadden\u2019s assertion that IBM has approached every major web-based company, but said it had engaged in discussions with companies like Yelp Inc and Airbnb Inc, among others. An IBM spokesman told Reuters it had not reached licensing deals with Yelp and Airbnb.  McBride said license fees help it recoup the billions it spends on R&D and reach productive arrangements with other innovative companies. IBM has secured more U.S. patents than any other company for the past 25 years.  Earlier on Thursday, McBride described licensing agreements the company has previously struck with Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet\u2019s Google, LinkedIn and Twitter, who have paid IBM fees ranging from $20 million to $50 million each.  Hadden also questioned McBride about IBM sales to so-called \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d who hold intellectual property solely for the purpose of filing lawsuits and have been widely criticized in the tech industry.  A lawyer for IBM objected to the questioning, saying it was irrelevant, but the judge instructed McBride to answer.  McBride said IBM was \u201cselective\u201d about who it sells patents to and strikes such deals in part to protect itself from trolls.  \u201cIf a patent troll wants to buy a patent from us then we insist on a covenant not to sue IBM,\u201d McBride said. \u201cWe achieve some level of protection from being sued ourselves.\u201d","57":"(Changes headline, lead, adds IBM comment)  BRUSSELS, April 25 (Reuters) - The European Union is targeting 20 billion euros ($24.36 billion) of investment in artificial intelligence by 2020 to catch up with Asia and the United States, which are each investing at least three times more than Europe.  Artificial intelligence promises to revolutionise sectors from healthcare to transport to agriculture and Europe is keen not to be left behind in the digital race.  The Commission, the EU executive, will boost its investment in artificial intelligence by about 70 percent to 1.5 billion euros ($1.83 billion). It wants total private and public investment in AI to reach at least 20 billion euros by the end of 2020 to ensure the bloc retains competitiveness and does not face a brain drain.  In 2016 European private investments in AI totalled around 2.4-3.2 billion euros, compared to Asia\u2019s almost 10 billion euros and America\u2019s 18 billion euros.  \u201cJust as the steam engine and electricity did in the past, AI is transforming our world,\u201d said Andrus Ansip, Vice-President of the European Commission, on Wednesday.  \u201cToday, we are giving a boost to researchers so that they can develop the next generation of AI technologies and applications, and to companies, so that they can embrace and incorporate them.\u201d  European countries such as France and Britain have also made AI investment a priority. French President Emmanuel Macron promised 1.5 billion euros of public money for AI in March.  The Commission said its 1.5 billion-euro investment ought to trigger an additional 2.5 billion euros from existing public-private partnerships, for example on big data and robotics.  To help stimulate investment the Commission also proposed legislation to open up more public sector data for re-use, such as the data held by transport authorities and utilities.  The tech industry welcomed the AI initiative while trade unions stressed the need to ensure AI develops in support of human beings rather than in place of them.  AI raises questions over the future of work as some types of jobs could be carried out more efficiently by machines.  \u201cThe European Commission is taking the right approach to AI,\u201d said Liam Benham, Vice President Government and Regulatory Affairs at IBM.  \u201cTheir strategy is grounded in ethics and a commitment to responsibility, it avoids a premature push to regulate, and its focus on bringing together industry, government and academic expertise is essential in positioning Europe to help shape the AI future.\u201d ($1 = 0.8209 euros) (Reporting by Julia Fioretti, Editing by Mark Heinrich)","58":"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to wade back into a case involving IBM Corp that questioned the proper standard for proving that companies were imprudent in managing employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs).

The German government\u2019s backing, sealed at a meeting on Tuesday between Chancellor Angela Merkel and IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, comes as Europe\u2019s largest economy seeks to catch up to the United States and China in a global technology race.  IBM said it would install a Q System One quantum computer at one of its facilities in Germany, partnering with the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft - an applied research institute - to build a research effort and community around it.  Quantum computers could operate millions of times faster than today\u2019s advanced supercomputers.  The technology is based on quantum bits, or qubits, that can be \u2018superposed\u2019 on each other, exponentially increasing the amount of information that can be processed. IBM\u2019s current Q System One machine has 20 qubits.  \u201cThis effort is poised to be a major catalyst for Europe\u2019s innovation landscape and research capabilities,\u201d Martin Jetter, senior vice president and chairman of IBM Europe, said in a statement.  Developing viable quantum computers has proved to be hugely challenging because they rely on superconductivity that can only be achieved in a controlled environment in which temperatures are held close to absolute zero.  Any instability in the qubits can lead to \u201cnoise\u201d that disrupts computing.  The IBM Q System One, launched in January, has so far been deployed primarily in a research setting but the company - which has branched into cloud computing and artificial intelligence - hopes to turn it into a commercial proposition.  Researchers will be able to access the quantum computer via the IBM cloud, with potential tasks ranging from mapping complex molecular structures and chemical reactions to making artificial intelligence more powerful.  \u201cThis partnership is a landmark quantum computing initiative and a crucial step forward for German research institutions as well as businesses of all sizes in our country,\u201d said Professor Reimund Neugebauer, President of Fraunhofer Gesellschaft.

REUTERS\/Sergio Perez\/File Photo  Shares of the technology company fell 6 percent in after-hours trade even as it reported the second quarter of revenue growth after a near six-year streak of declines.  IBM has in recent years shifted its focus to higher-margin businesses such as cloud computing, cybersecurity and data analytics, to counter a slowdown in its legacy hardware and software businesses, but the move is not going as fast as some shareholders had hoped.  While IBM\u2019s revenue and profit beat expectations, the company\u2019s adjusted gross profit margin fell to 43.7 percent from 44.5 percent a year earlier.  The company said the decline in gross margin was mostly due to \u201csignificant\u201d one-time charges.  On an earnings call with analysts, IBM CFO James Kavanaugh said the company cut costs and took a $610 million charge in the first quarter, though he did not give details.

The pilot, overseen by responsible-sourcing group RCS Global, aims to help manufacturers ensure that cobalt used in lithium-ion batteries has not been mined by children or used to fuel conflict.  Companies are under pressure from consumers and investors to prove that minerals are sourced without human rights abuses, but tracking raw materials throughout their journey is challenging.  The project announced on Wednesday has been quietly under way since December. Starting with industrially mined cobalt in Congo, it is monitoring supplies all the way to lithium-ion batteries for Ford vehicles.  Supplies of cobalt, expected to be needed in huge quantities for electric vehicles and electronic devices, are concentrated in Congo, a sprawling, volatile nation that has been racked by civil war and political tension.  The outcome of elections in December, which had been intended to be Congo\u2019s first democratic transfer of power in six decades, is contested. [nL8N1ZB393]  RCS says the IBM blockchain platform could be used to include other minerals and to allow artisanal miners, which analysts say are the biggest issue with regard to ethical sourcing, to join a blockchain-based network of validated participants.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Blockchain, famed as the technology behind cryptocurrency bitcoin, works by providing a shared record of data held by a network of individual computers rather than a single party.  For the pilot project, which should be completed around the middle of the year, cobalt from Huayou\u2019s industrial mine will be placed in secure bags, entered into a blockchain and traced from the mine and smelter to LG Chem\u2019s cathode and battery plant in South Korea and then on to a Ford plant in the United States.  Because minerals are often combined with metals from various sources when they are smelted, they are particularly difficult to track.  The RCS project seeks to enforce best practice by using guidelines drawn up by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.  IBM said it was exploring the potential of chemical analysis using artificial intelligence to pinpoint the origin of cobalt and ensure so-called clean cobalt was not smelted with minerals sourced less responsibly.  \u201cThere is no fool-proof method, but you have to keep the ball moving forward, to keep raising the level of accuracy,\u201d Manish Chawla, general manager of IBM\u2019s mining and industrial sector business, told Reuters.  \u201cBlockchain has been proven to be a very effective technology in raising the bar.\u201d  IBM has already worked with retailers including Walmart WMT.N and Carrefour CARR.PA to trace food through supply chains.

Ginni Rometty, IBM chief executive since 2012, has steered the company toward faster-growing segments such as cloud, software and services and away from traditional hardware products, but not without a bumpy journey. The newer areas of focus have sometimes underwhelmed investors.  In an interview, Rometty said the deal was driven by what its customers wanted and helping companies \u201cmove mission-critical work\u201d to the cloud, offering a variety of hybrid public and private clouds. \u201cWe have all the critical parts,\u201d she said.  Customers want hybrid cloud applications because they \u201clook at their IT and they say, \u2018Look I can\u2019t just throw it all out and rebuild it\u2019\u201d and instead want a mix of public and private cloud applications \u201cwith one platform across it.\u201d  Rometty cited as examples major IBM cloud customers like Morgan Stanley MS.N and Delta Air Lines DAL.N.  Delta chief executive Ed Bastian said in a statement the company has been \u201cworking with both IBM and Red Hat for years\u201d and said the combined firm \u201cwill be an essential part of our digital transformation.\u201d  The company, which won approval for the purchase from U.S. regulators in May and European Union regulators in late June, agreed to pay $190 a share for Red Hat, representing a 63 percent premium.  Founded in 1993, Red Hat specializes in Linux operating systems, the most popular type of open-source software and an alternative to proprietary software made by Microsoft Corp MSFT.O. IBM has faced years of revenue declines as it transitions from its legacy computer hardware business into new technology products and services.  Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst and his management team will remain in place. Whitehurst will join IBM\u2019s senior management team and report to Rometty.  IBM will maintain Red Hat\u2019s headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, and its facilities, brands and practices, and said it will operate as a distinct unit within IBM. Rometty said no job or cost cuts are planned at Red Hat.  IBM closed down 0.9 percent at $139.33.

FILE PHOTO: The logo for IBM is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., June 27, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are providing the 364-day bridge loan for IBM\u2019s $34 billion takeover, which includes debt. The deal is the company\u2019s largest strategic acquisition and is designed to bolster its cloud business and increase profit margins.  IBM\u2019s bridge loan just sneaks into the top 10 biggest US bridge loans ever arranged, a position that it shares with the $20 billion facility that backed AT&T\u2019s purchase of T-Mobile USA in 2011, according to LPC data. At the time, that was the biggest sole underwriting by a bank by arranger JP Morgan.  Banks have been waiting for more acquisition loans, particularly in the technology space, after a record $100 billion loan package that was put in place in February for chipmaker Broadcom Corp\u2019s takeover of rival Qualcomm was scuttled by national security concerns in March.  That deal, which would have been the biggest loan ever globally if it had cleared regulatory hurdles, revealed deep loan market liquidity for tech borrowers, which is still on the table.  \u201cPent up demand is definitely at play,\u201d said one senior banker. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a light amount of new-money activity of late.\u201d  IBM\u2019s deal reflects a growing pace of consolidation in the technology space this year, as companies build scale and product diversity to stay competitive.  US technology M&A, at about $279 billion so far this year, is already more than three times the deal value seen in the same period last year, according to Deals Intelligence.  MIXED M&A YEAR  About $86 billion of US investment-grade bridge loans were issued in the first half of 2018, before plunging to less than $2 billion in the third quarter, LPC data shows. Fears about trade wars, US mid-term elections, and rising interest rates boosted stock and debt market volatility and put the brakes on deal making.  Despite broader capital markets volatility, loan bankers are still keen to lend to highly rated companies that are seeking to buy growth by acquisition. Companies are cash rich because of lower US corporate tax rates as well as cheaper access to overseas money due to US tax reform.  \u201cYou\u2019re probably not going to see anything but deep support for an A1\/A rated tech name making an acquisition that keeps them focused on what they do and broadening their appeal within the cloud\/software space,\u201d the senior banker said.  IBM\u2019s senior unsecured debt is rated A1 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, and is on review for a one-notch downgrade based on the additional debt for the Red Hat purchase. A one-notch downgrade would put the rating on par with S&P\u2019s rating, which was cut on October 29 to A from A+, based on rising acquisition-related leverage.  Moody\u2019s estimates IBM\u2019s pro-forma gross adjusted debt to Ebitda at 1.7 times as of September 30, and S&P estimates 1.0 times currently.  The merger is \u201ca game changer,\u201d and the combination with Red Hat \u201cis about resetting the cloud landscape,\u201d IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty said on an investor conference call.  FEE EVENT  The IBM\/Red Hat merger will earn total fees of about $37.4 million for banks arranging the $20 billion bridge loan, and a total between $84 million-$96 million of advisory fees, according to preliminary estimates from Deals Intelligence.  After the third-quarter slump in investment-grade M&A, bankers have been waiting for lucrative new lending opportunities.  \u201cEspecially on the heels of the Qualcomm\/Broadcom deal coming undone, and seeing a lot of other mega deals being done earlier in 2018, it proves that banks are still very supportive of M&A transactions,\u201d another senior banker said.  The largest ever US bridge loan for a blue chip company is still the $61 billion facility arranged in 2013 for Verizon Communications Inc\u2019s buyout of Vodafone Group\u2019s stake in Verizon\u2019s US wireless business. That loan far surpasses the second-biggest bridge loan, a $49 billion facility, which was put in place in 2017 to back pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp\u2019s acquisition of health insurer Aetna Inc.  Other huge US bridge loans in 2018 that also make the top 10 include a $35.7 billion facility for Walt Disney Co that financed the cash portion of its bid to buy Twenty-First Century Fox media assets, which is the fourth-largest bridge on record; and a $23.7 billion bridge backing Cigna Corp\u2019s acquisition of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co, which is the sixth-largest deal ever.","83":"A federal judge in Manhattan has refused to send notice to 13,000 former IBM Corp employees of a proposed age bias collective action lawsuit against the company, saying a nationwide collective must be narrowed for the case to move forward.

Big Blue is the first U.S. tech major to report quarterly results for the period ending March 31, during which the country\u2019s economy was badly hit as the pandemic kept people indoors.  \u201cOur near-term performance will ultimately be influenced by client buying patterns in this economic environment,\u201d Kavanaugh said.  IBM for several years has been focused on becoming a major player in the cloud services industry, acquiring Linux maker Red Hat and selling some legacy businesses.  Revenue from the cloud business, previously headed by IBM\u2019s new boss Krishna, rose 19% to $5.4 billion in the first quarter.  Krishna took over the chief executive officer role from Ginni Rometty in April, while appointing former Bank of America Corp's BAC.N top technology executive Howard Boville as the new head of IBM's cloud business.  IBM\u2019s total revenue fell 3.4% to $17.57 billion in the reported quarter, slightly below analysts\u2019 estimates of $17.62 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding the impact from currency and business divestitures, the company recorded a marginal growth in revenue.  Net income fell to $1.18 billion, or $1.31 per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $1.59 billion, or $1.78 per share, a year earlier.

Top corporate executives and directors should \u201cknow the intent of our adversaries and what they are trying to do economically to gain the upper hand,\u201d William Evanina, a veteran FBI agent who oversees the center, said in an interview. \u201cWe are not saying don\u2019t invest in China or with China, but know the risk.\u201d  The drive targets trade associations across the United States and their members. Videos, brochures and online informational materials describe the threat posed by cyber espionage and other methods used by foreign intelligence services.  One brochure details methods hackers use to break into computer networks and how they create fake social media accounts to deceive people into revealing work or personal details. It outlines ways to protect information, such as researching apps before downloading them and updating anti-virus software.  The first parts of this administration outreach effort called \u201cKnow the Risk, Raise Your Shield,\u201d focused mainly on federal workers. The new phase follows a series of cases announced by the U.S. government against individuals and firms for allegedly stealing government secrets and proprietary information from U.S. companies for China\u2019s benefit.  Nine cases announced since July 2018 included the unsealing last month of an indictment of two alleged hackers linked to China\u2019s main spy agency on charges that they stole confidential government and corporate data. The pair allegedly belonged to a hacking ring known as APT 10.  Evanina said the new campaign also focuses on what he called Moscow\u2019s \u201caggressive, persistent attacks\u201d on computer networks of critical U.S. infrastructure, which includes power grids and communications, financial and transportation systems.  China and Russia have repeatedly denied conducting such attacks.  The most serious threats now facing companies, Evanina said, are efforts to plant malicious software in components purchased from suppliers or to substitute counterfeit parts for genuine products.  Companies need to take greater care to counter those efforts and in vetting new hires because of the growing danger of employing people acting for foreign powers, he said.","113":"FILE PHOTO: Logos of CVS and Aetna are displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp\u2019s Aetna and a host of other health insurers said on Thursday they have partnered with IBM Corp to create a blockchain network aimed at cutting costs in the healthcare industry.  The companies intend to use blockchain technology, which allows the sharing of databases across a network of computers, for processing claims and payments and to maintain directories, they said in a joint statement.  Blockchain, the technology that underpins crypto-currencies such as bitcoin, is being increasingly adopted across varied industries. Financial services firms too note the distributed ledger technology has the potential to generate wide-ranging savings.  Other companies involved in the project are health insurers Anthem Inc, Health Care Service Corp and financial services company PNC Bank.  \u201cUsing this technology, we can remove friction, duplication, and administrative costs that continue to plague the industry,\u201d Chris Ward, an executive at PNC Bank\u2019s treasury management unit said.  New members, including technology companies and healthcare providers, are expected to join the collaboration in the coming months, according to the statement.  Another blockchain alliance was formed in April between several healthcare firms including insurers Humana Inc and UnitedHealthcare Group to explore how the technology could be used to make the most current healthcare provider information available in directories.  Aetna and Ascension, the largest U.S. non-profit health system, are also partners in the other project.","114":"Oct 29 (Reuters) - IBM Corp\u2019s $34 billion deal to buy Red Hat Inc drove shares in the small but fast-growing software maker 50 percent higher on Monday, reflecting the huge premium IBM is paying to ward off any potential challenger bids.  At $175, shares of Red Hat were still trading around $15 short of the $190 price agreed by the two companies in Sunday\u2019s announcement, and analysts said that pointed to some remaining nerves among investors over the chances of the deal closing.  The breakup fee for the deal has yet to be announced and a high fee would also deter Red Hat from entertaining other buyers.  IBM\u2019s stock was down about 5 percent on news of the deal.  The company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty told CNBC in an interview aired early on Monday that she felt the deal was done at the right price.  \u201cThis is a very fair price...(Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst) has built a great company, and unlike others, high growth, high profit and cash and so this is why I think really those are important things for our investors,\u201d Rometty said.  One brokerage, Stifel, raised the prospect of a competing offer from one of the other major players in cloud computing for whom the deal represents the emergence of a more substantial rival.  \u201cGoogle, Amazon, and Microsoft (and potentially Oracle) have the strategic motivations and financial resources to consummate such a transaction and would not be surprised if we were to see one of them make a competing bid,\u201d analysts from Stifel said in a note.  HYBRID CLOUD  Rometty told Reuters on Sunday that the increasing use of cloud services from multiple providers was the driving force behind the deal along with the rise of the so-called hybrid cloud, in which companies run some of their software in their own data centers and other elements of it in data centers run by IBM, Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud, among others.  Red Hat has been investing heavily in tech tools such as so-called \u201ccontainers,\u201d which make it easier for businesses to split up their computing work among a mix of data centers.  \u201cThey want choice and we are going to give it to them,\u201d Rometty said. \u201cMulti-cloud is a fact of life.\u201d  In buying Red Hat, IBM will have assembled a cloud that includes physical servers, its own operating system and applications like human resources software.  But the combined entity will also sell software that runs on its customers own hardware and other clouds. That will put it in direct competition with firms like Microsoft, which has a similar mix of software and cloud services.  \u201cWe are going to both compete and partner with those other clouds,\u201d Rometty said. \u201cThe thing about IBM is, we\u2019ve been around long enough to know this is a multi-cloud world.\u201d  Jim Whitehurst, the CEO of Red Hat, said the use of multiple clouds has been an advantage for Red Hat.  Cloud providers such as Amazon often offer a house-made version of the Linux operating system for free or at little cost. But that version of Linux is available only on Amazon, and if the business wants to run software on another cloud they would have to ensure it works with a different version of Linux there.  Red Hat offers a standard version of Linux that runs on commonly available clouds as well as a business\u2019s own data centers, and Whitehurst said Red Hat customers were increasingly running its operating system on public clouds.  \u201cWe are growing faster on the public clouds than the public clouds are growing,\u201d Whitehurst said in an interview. \u201cYeah, you pay us a little extra versus a free cloud offering, but you get the benefit of a standard operating environment.\u201d (Reporting by Pushkala Aripaka and Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru, Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; editing by Patrick Graham)","115":"Oct 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened slightly lower on Wednesday, a day after Wall Street\u2019s strongest rally in seven months, as investors were disappointed with IBM\u2019s results and remained cautious ahead of the minutes of Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting.

The proportion of executives who thought competitors were set to flood into their industry has halved from 54 percent to 26 percent compared to two years ago, the broad-based poll of business decision-makers showed.  \u201cThere\u2019s been a feeling historically that the elephants can\u2019t dance, the incumbents will find it hard to respond and that everyone will be Uber-ed or Airbnb-ed out of existence,\u201d Mark Foster, senior vice president of IBM Global Business Services, told Reuters in an interview.  \u201cBut what we are seeing is actually there is a limit as to how far that can go.\u201d  While some sectors had been hugely disrupted by new digital entrants and some intermediaries pushed out, many of those changes were now being led by existing industry players, he said.  Disruption is a catch-all term for the use of digital technology to up-end existing business models, for example Uber\u2019s impact on the taxi industry by using smartphones to connect riders with drivers, and pricing according to demand.  But just 27 percent of the executives surveyed said they were experiencing significant disruption, an unexpected finding given the deluge many predicted, IBM said. Only 23 percent said the big drivers of change were from outside their industries.  Digital giants, like Google, Apple and Facebook, continued to concentrate their power in some industries, but according to the executives surveyed they were not leading the disruption, and start-ups were increasingly quiescent, the survey found.  Instead, 72 percent said it was the most innovative incumbents who were leading the disruption, including in industries targeted by start-ups such as financial services.  IBM said the incumbents had become better at spotting and acquiring nascent disruptors. They had also realized the need to find partners, even sharing physical assets and people with them, to acquire new skills.  They are investing in the technologies that facilitate the sharing of data across organizations - such as the Internet of Things, which bridges physical and digital assets, and blockchain.  \u201cDisruption hasn\u2019t gone underground,\u201d IBM said in its report released before the start of the mobile industry\u2019s biggest event, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  \u201cInstead, it\u2019s emerging as a capability incumbents are ready to embrace.\u201d  IBM surveyed 12,854 top executives, such as chief executives and finance directors, from 112 countries for its report.  \u201cWho Says Elephants Can\u2019t Dance\u201d was the title of the memoir of 1990s era IBM CEO Lou Gerstner, who is credited with bringing the company back from a near-death experience by shifting it into software and services and exiting most hardware businesses.","120":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Sabadell SABE.MC has hired IBM IBM.N for a 1 billion euro ($1.11 billion) overhaul of its IT systems over the next ten years, Miguel Montes, the bank's director of operations and people, said on Wednesday.

The justices will hear an appeal by IBM\u2019s retirement plan of a lower court ruling allowing the litigation to proceed. IBM is not a defendant in the case.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American business community\u2019s biggest lobbying arm, had urged the Supreme Court in a brief to hear the case, saying a ruling against the fund could deter companies from offering retirement plans that invest in company stock. Thousands of companies offer such programs.  Participants in IBM\u2019s retirement plan have said that in 2013 the company\u2019s microelectronics division was incurring losses even though IBM said at the time it was valued at $2 billion.  The plaintiffs have said the Retirement Plans Committee of IBM, which oversees the fund, knew or should have known that the business was overvalued. The committee\u2019s members included senior IBM executives.  IBM sold the microelectronics business a year later at a significant loss, leading to a decline in the company\u2019s stock price. IBM paid GlobalFoundries Inc $1.5 billion to take over the money-losing unit and announced it would take a $2.4 billion write-down on the entire value of assets as well as $800 million of other unspecified costs.  The plaintiffs sued the committee and its members in 2015. A federal judge dismissed the complaint the following year. The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a ruling last year revived the litigation, prompting the retirement plan committee to appeal to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court will hear arguments and issue a ruling in its next term, which starts in October.  The IBM dispute is a sequel to a 2014 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that a lawsuit brought by employees against Fifth Third Bancorp for putting company stock in its employment retirement plan ahead of the housing downturn could move forward.","126":"(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp IBM.N beat estimates for second-quarter profit on Monday and signaled that demand in its cloud computing business would get a boost as large corporations accelerate their digital shift due to the coronavirus crisis.

Streamlining those operations has saved $2 billion annually, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on an earnings call last month. However, the bank still relies on cloud services from external vendors since third parties can usually offer the service 23%-30% cheaper, he said.  \u201cWe don\u2019t need to own the hardware,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just need to find out who can provide it the right way.\u201d Investing in cloud computing is key for banks as more transactions become digital. It is critical that the platform can transfer information quickly, keep data private, and prevent service outages.  Bank of America customers reported trouble accessing online banking and card services late last month, according to Downdetector.com.  Cloud services used by banks have come under scrutiny in Washington after a massive data breach at Capital One Financial Corp raised questions over the risks posed by banks\u2019 reliance on third-party cloud providers.  U.S. lawmakers have asked regulators to consider direct oversight of the cloud services big tech companies provide to banks - like Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp\u2019s Microsoft Azure and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Cloud - saying they have become a critical component of the global financial system. IBM was not one of the cloud providers mentioned in the letter.

IBM said it has partnered with the research wing of Daimler AG\u2019s Mercedes-Benz, battery electrolyte supplier Central Glass, and battery manufacturer Sidus for the commercial development of the new design.  \u201cThe goal would be, within a year or so, to have the first working prototype (of the battery),\u201d said Jeff Welser, vice president at IBM Research.  IBM may not necessarily end up making a product using the design, Welser added.  The move comes as top battery makers are scrambling to reduce cobalt content in lithium-ion batteries, and as the expansion of the electric vehicle market is expected to result in shortages of the mineral mainly found in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  IBM said its technology has proven to outperform lithium-ion batteries in cost, charging time, and energy efficiency.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Berlin\u2019s support, sealed at a meeting on Tuesday between Chancellor Angela Merkel and IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, comes as Europe\u2019s biggest economy seeks to catch up to the United States and China in a global technology race.  IBM will install a Q System One quantum computer at one of its facilities in Germany, partnering with the Fraunhofer Society - an applied research institute - to build a research unit and community around it.  Quantum computers could operate millions of times faster than today\u2019s advanced supercomputers.  The technology is based on quantum bits, or qubits, that can be \u2018superposed\u2019 on each other, exponentially increasing the amount of information that can be processed. IBM\u2019s current Q System One machine has 20 qubits.  \u201cThis effort is poised to be a major catalyst for Europe\u2019s innovation landscape and research capabilities,\u201d said Martin Jetter, senior vice president and chairman of IBM Europe.  The quantum computer - the first to be deployed by IBM outside the United States - will be shipped to Germany and set up next year. In the meantime, German researchers will gain access to IBM\u2019s U.S.-based Q Network research forum.  Building a research community around the project has the potential to create \u201ca unique concentration of skills\u201d, Jetter told Reuters, drawing parallels to the origins of Silicon Valley in the United States.  SUPERCOOLED COMPUTING  Developing viable quantum computers has proved to be hugely challenging because they rely on superconductivity that can only be achieved in temperatures close to absolute zero.  Any instability in the qubits, for example from vibrations, can lead to \u201cnoise\u201d that causes calculation errors and undermines a quantum computer\u2019s power to solve problems.  The Q System One, launched in January, has been deployed primarily in a research setting but IBM - which has branched into cloud computing and artificial intelligence in recent years - hopes to turn it into a commercial proposition.  Researchers will be able to access the quantum computer via the IBM cloud, with potential tasks ranging from mapping complex molecular structures and chemical reactions to making artificial intelligence more powerful.  Another application is financial risk and portfolio analysis, as the equations that run on quantum computers resemble economic systems, said Torsten Uwe Siebert, manager of the Quantum Technology Program at the Fraunhofer Society.  Merkel\u2019s government last year said it would make available 3 billion euros to sponsor the research and development of artificial intelligence by 2025 as it seeks to regain ground in cutting-edge research.","139":"(Reuters) - IBM Corp said on Sunday it had agreed to acquire U.S. software company Red Hat Inc for $34 billion, including debt, as it seeks to diversify its technology hardware and consulting business into higher-margin products and services.  The transaction is by far IBM\u2019s biggest acquisition. It underscores IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty\u2019s efforts to expand the company\u2019s subscription-based software offerings, as it faces slowing software sales and waning demand for mainframe servers.  IBM, which has a market capitalization of $114 billion, will pay $190 per share in cash for Red Hat, a 63 percent premium to Friday\u2019s closing share price.  Founded in 1993, Red Hat specializes in Linux operating systems, the most popular type of open-source software, which was developed as an alternative to proprietary software made by Microsoft Corp.  Headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Red Hat charges fees to its corporate customers for custom features, maintenance and technical support, offering IBM a lucrative source of subscription revenue.  Red Hat is one of the very few companies in the cloud computing sector that has both revenue growth and free cash flow, Rometty, who has been IBM\u2019s CEO since 2012, said in an interview with Reuters.  \u201cThis acquisition we are clearly doing for growth synergies. This is not about cost synergies at all,\u201d Rometty said in the interview.  FILE PHOTO: A logo of IBM is seen at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Yves Herman\/File Photo  The acquisition illustrates how older technology companies are turning to dealmaking to gain scale and fend off competition, especially in cloud computing, where customers using enterprise software are seeking to save money by consolidating their vendor relationships.  IBM is hoping the deal will help it catch up with Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc and Microsoft in the rapidly growing cloud business. IBM shares have lost almost a third of their value in the past five years, while Red Hat shares are up 170 percent over the same period.  \u201cThis deal represents the culmination of IBM\u2019s existing partnership with Red Hat, and, in our view, allows IBM to gain a highly strategic asset to advance its hybrid cloud initiatives,\u201d Barclays analysts wrote in a research note.  They added that for the deal to work, it was important for IBM to uphold Red Hat\u2019s neutrality when it came to operating platforms and maintain Red Hat\u2019s open-source and multi-cloud position in the market.  BIG BLUE  IBM was founded in 1911 and is known in the technology industry as Big Blue, a reference to its once ubiquitous blue computers. It has faced years of revenue declines, as it transitions its legacy computer maker business into new technology products and services. Its recent initiatives have included artificial intelligence and business lines around Watson, named after the supercomputer it developed.  To be sure, IBM is no stranger to acquisitions. It acquired cloud infrastructure provider Softlayer in 2013 for $2 billion, and the Weather Channel\u2019s data assets for more than $2 billion in 2015. It also acquired Canadian business software maker Cognos in 2008 for $5 billion.  Other big technology companies have also recently sought to reinvent themselves through acquisitions. Microsoft this year acquired open source software platform GitHub for $7.5 billion; chip maker Broadcom Inc agreed to acquire software maker CA Inc for nearly $19 billion; and Adobe Inc agreed to acquire marketing software maker Marketo for $5 billion.  One of IBM\u2019s main competitors, Dell Technologies Inc, made a big bet on software and cloud computing two years ago, when it acquired data storage company EMC for $67 billion. As part of that deal, Dell inherited an 82 percent stake in virtualization software company VMware Inc.  The deal between IBM and Red Hat is expected to close in the second half of 2019. IBM said it planned to suspend its share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021 to help pay for the deal.  IBM said Red Hat would continue to be led by Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst and Red Hat\u2019s current management team. It intends to maintain Red Hat\u2019s headquarters, facilities, brands and practices.  Lazard Ltd offered financial advice to IBM, alongside Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co, which also provided financing for the deal. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP provided legal advice to IBM.  Guggenheim Partners LLC and Morgan Stanley were financial advisers to Red Hat, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP offered legal advice to the company on the deal.  \u201cKnowing first-hand how important open, hybrid cloud technologies are to helping businesses unlock value, we see the power of bringing these two companies together, and are honored to advise IBM and commit financing for this transaction,\u201d JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement.","140":"LONDON (Reuters) - Europe could experience a relatively mild winter again this year, despite La Ni\u00f1a conditions that usually bring colder conditions to the northern hemisphere, the Weather Company said in its winter outlook on Thursday.

The deal will also help HCL collect additional revenue of about $650 million in the second year of the acquisition on a run-rate basis, though sales would take a roughly $25 million hit in the first year.  Shares in HCL, which lags bigger local rivals Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) TCS.NS and Infosys INFY.NS in big data, analytics and cloud computing, tumbled as much as 7.7 percent on Friday to their lowest since July 6 after the deal was announced.  The fall knocked some $1.5 billion off the market value of the company chaired by India\u2019s sixth-richest person Shiv Nadar.  Some IT analysts said the deal did not make strategic sense for HCL over the long term because it already maintained a partnership with IBM for a bulk of the products it was buying and was overpaying for the purchase.  The products being acquired were in the middle or end of their life cycles and would likely not show more than a mid-single digit percentage growth, Indian brokerage Axis Capital said in a note.  \u201cThis deal is a negative from HCL\u2019s standpoint,\u201d said Sudheer Guntupalli, an analyst with Ambit Capital in Mumbai, adding that HCL would have to keep investing in these products to ensure they don\u2019t become obsolete.

At $172, shares of Red Hat were still trading around $18 short of the $190 price agreed by the two companies in Sunday\u2019s announcement, and analysts said that pointed to some remaining nerves among investors over the chances of the deal closing.  The breakup fee for the deal, which would be among the largest on record in the tech sector, has yet to be announced and a high fee would also deter Red Hat from entertaining other buyers.  IBM\u2019s stock was down 2 percent on news of the deal, a hint that investors were concerned that, at 10 times 2019 projected sales, it had overpaid for the deal.

Red Hat has been investing heavily in tech tools such as so-called \u201ccontainers,\u201d which make it easier for businesses to split up their computing work among a mix of data centers.  \u201cThey want choice and we are going to give it to them,\u201d Rometty said. \u201cMulti-cloud is a fact of life.\u201d  In buying Red Hat, IBM will have assembled a cloud that includes physical servers, its own operating system and applications like human resources software.  But the combined entity will also sell software that runs on its customers own hardware and other clouds. That will put it in direct competition with firms like Microsoft, which has a similar mix of software and cloud services.  \u201cWe are going to both compete and partner with those other clouds,\u201d Rometty said. \u201cThe thing about IBM is, we\u2019ve been around long enough to know this is a multi-cloud world.\u201d  Jim Whitehurst, the CEO of Red Hat, said the use of multiple clouds has been an advantage for Red Hat.  Cloud providers such as Amazon often offer a house-made version of the Linux operating system for free or at little cost. But that version of Linux is available only on Amazon, and if the business wants to run software on another cloud they would have to ensure it works with a different version of Linux there.

LedgerConnect - which is based on a model similar to that of consumer app stores - aims to make it easier and cheaper for financial firms to use blockchain-based software.  Blockchain, which first emerged as the system underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared ledger of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers rather than a centralized authority. Banks and other financial institutions have been investing millions of dollars in developing the technology which they believe can help them simplify some of their processes and cut costs.  While many blockchain-based applications are being tested by banks, few have gone into production.  CLS and IBM hope that LedgerConnect can help speed up adoption by making blockchain-based software for financial firms more readily available, they said.  Building and testing each application individually by banks would be too costly and time consuming, they said.  A shared platform run by an existing market structure provider can also help ensure that the applications by different vendors are vetted to meet the technical and security standards required by financial firms, Alan Marquard, chief strategy and development officer at CLS, said in an interview.  CLS settles over $5 trillion of payment instructions a day for its members which include many of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions such as Barclays and Citi.  \u201cBarclays is participating in the LedgerConnect proof-of-concept so we can gain an understanding and experience of a new network for blockchain applications \u2013 and also test some candidate use cases on that network,\u201d Lee Braine, from the chief technology office of Barclays\u2019 investment bank, said in an email.

He will replace current boss Virginia Rometty in April, the company announced on Thursday. Shareholders won\u2019t miss her: At $121 billion, Big Blue\u2019s market value has almost halved since she took the reins at the start of 2012. It now has a reputation as a former hardware provider that lost its way when the world moved on. Microsoft\u2019s resurgence under boss Satya Nadella offers the best path ahead.  The two companies were both worth roughly $220 billion when Rometty took charge of IBM. One of her recent strategic moves even echoes those of former Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer. He paid way above the odds for a couple of companies in an attempt to leave behind the company\u2019s stodgy image - before being effectively forced out in 2014. Rometty, meanwhile, splashed out too much in her $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat unveiled in 2018.  Nadella managed to get past Ballmer\u2019s deals, despite adding a pricey-looking takeover of his own with LinkedIn, and has overseen a largely successful upgrade and expansion of its software while also growing its cloud-computing business, where revenue grew 62% in its most recent quarter. That makes it the main contender to industry leader Amazon. Over the past eight years the value of the company has increased six-fold to $1.3 trillion.

It sold part of its business to Microsoft \u2013 one of Ballmer\u2019s bad deals \u2013 and shares in the rest now trade at just 6% of their market high in 2000. Yahoo is another tale of woe.

The move comes as top battery makers scramble to reduce cobalt content in lithium-ion batteries, and as the expansion of the electric vehicle market is expected to result in shortages of the mineral mainly found in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  IBM said its technology has proven to outperform lithium-ion batteries in cost, charging time and energy efficiency.  The company also said it is partnering with the University of Tokyo on an initiative to advance quantum computing by developing the first practical application of the technology.  Under the agreement, an IBM Q System One, the company\u2019s quantum computing system designed for scientific use, will be installed in an IBM facility in Japan - the first such installation in the region.

REUTERS\/Yves Herman  WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Federal Reserve\u2019s jobs push is getting a helpful nudge from IBM. Big Blue is rethinking its U.S. employee needs. More than half of its openings no longer require a bachelor\u2019s degree, for example. It\u2019s one way to meet the challenge of the post-coronavirus economy, in which employers can\u2019t fill vacancies even as central bank boss Jerome Powell frets over lost jobs.  The pandemic has exacerbated inequalities that had begun to ease before the virus hit. The overall unemployment rate was 6.3% in January, compared to 3.5% a year ago. But for a person whose best qualification is a high school diploma, it was 7.1%, 3.4 percentage points higher than a year ago. The January jobless rate for people with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree was just 4%. Noting these gaps, Powell on Wednesday called for a society-wide effort to reach full employment.  Meanwhile, some employers are hiring amid vaccinations and improved management of Covid-19. U.S. monthly job openings rose by 74,000 positions to nearly 6.7 million, the Labor Department said this week. But the National Federation of Independent Business found that one-third of small businesses could not fill vacancies, almost 30% of which were for skilled workers.  IBM is shedding its staid image to pitch innovative ideas to bridge that mismatch. Last month in a letter to nominees to lead the Labor and Education Departments, Obed Louissaint, a senior IBM executive, asked the government to expand eligibility for $130 billion in annual student aid.  About 65% of Americans who are at least 25 years old don\u2019t have a college degree, shutting them out of such assistance. That\u2019s why IBM wants student loans and so-called Pell grants available for part-time students, mid-career professionals, apprenticeships and certificate programs.  Another point of friction IBM points out is the difficulty of transferring academic credit to another institution. That particularly hurts students at community colleges who often intend to move to another school to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree. Making that easier would help low-income students the most.  Flooding the economy with cash, the main option open to the Fed and the one Congress has largely so far also taken, is one way to counteract the pandemic. IBM\u2019s more nuanced suggestions could help make the economy more resilient next time.","184":"* U.S. sells $27 bln 10-year notes to poor demand * Longer-dated Treasury yields hit 5-week lows before rising * Corporate supply led by IBM adds upward pressure on yields * U.S. plans higher tariffs on $200 bln of Chinese imports (Updates market action, adds quote) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, May 8 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields rose on Wednesday, reversing an earlier drop due to trade worries, as traders sold their bond holdings in the wake of a poor 10-year note auction and competing supply from the corporate bond market. Earlier Wednesday, longer-dated yields fell to a five-week lows as investors had piled money into low-risk government debt amid an escalating trade battle between economic giants China and the United States. The pickup in safe-haven demand for Treasuries had stoked expectations for solid bidding for $27 billion of new 10-year supply, the second leg of this week's $84 billion quarterly government refunding, analysts said. Those bids did not materialize, resulting in a \"terrible\" 10-year auction, said DRW Trading market strategist Lou Brien. \"The weakness in the bidding might boil down to the fact that it has just come too far, too fast, and there isn\u2019t a lot of further upside at this yield,\" Tom Simons, senior money market strategist at Jefferies LLC, wrote in a research note. The ratio of bids to the amount of 10-year notes offered was 2.17, the lowest reading on this measure of overall auction demand since March 2008. The Treasury will complete this week's refunding, which would raise $28.6 billion in fresh cash for the federal government, with a $19 billion 30-year bond auction on Thursday. In the credit sector, IBM is expected to sell about $20 billion in debt to help fund its acquisition of software company Red Hat, according to IFR. At 1:47 p.m. (1747 GMT), the yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were up 3.6 basis points at 2.484% after hitting a five-week low of 2.426% earlier in the session. The United States said it will raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% from 10% effective Friday, with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He due to arrive in Washington for two days of trade talks. U.S. officials have accused China of reneging over the past week on substantial commitments made during months of negotiations aimed at ending their trade war. The abrupt deterioration in relations between the world's two largest economies and reduced prospects for a trade deal have rattled investor confidence about prospects for the global economy and business activities.

IBM said on Thursday that the campaign was a sign that digital spies are turning their attention to the complex logistical work involved in inoculating the world\u2019s population against the novel coronavirus, although some outside experts questioned whether that was the hackers\u2019 focus.  In a blog post here published on Thursday, IBM said it had uncovered \"a global phishing campaign\" focused on organizations associated with the COVID-19 vaccine \"cold chain\" - the process needed to keep vaccine doses at extremely cold temperatures as they travel from manufacturers to people's arms.  The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency reposted the report, warning here members of Operation Warp Speed - the U.S. government's national vaccine mission - to be on the lookout.  Other cybsecurity experts expressed some skepticism, however, of IBM\u2019s findings.  Joe Slowik, a researcher at online threat intelligence firm DomainTools, said he believed IBM had stumbled upon \u201ca subset of activity\u201d that was part of a much wider campaign \u201cwhich may not be focused on vaccines or similar activity.\u201d  While \u201cdefinitely malicious,\u201d Slowik said he was not convinced it was specifically focused on vaccine distribution.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Who is behind the espionage is not clear. Messages sent to the email addresses used by the hackers were not returned.  Understanding how to build a secure cold chain is fundamental to distributing vaccines developed by the likes of Pfizer Inc and BioNTech <SE 22UAy.F> because the shots need to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below to avoid spoiling.  IBM\u2019s cybersecurity unit said it had detected an advanced group of hackers working to gather information about different aspects of the cold chain, using meticulously crafted booby-trapped emails sent in the name of an executive with Haier Biomedical, a Chinese cold chain provider that specializes in vaccine transport and biological sample storage.  Haier Medical did not return messages seeking comment.  Targets included companies involved in the manufacture of solar panels, which are used to power vaccine refrigerators in warm countries, and petrochemical products that could be used to derive dry ice.  The hackers went through \u201can exceptional amount of effort,\u201d said IBM analyst Claire Zaboeva, who helped draft the report. Hackers researched the correct make, model, and pricing of various Haier refrigeration units, Zaboeva said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cWhoever put together this campaign was intimately aware of whatever products were involved in the supply chain to deliver a vaccine for a global pandemic,\u201d she said.  The only organization identified by name in IBM\u2019s report - the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union - said in a statement that it was aware that it had been targeted in the hacking campaign.  \u201cWe have taken the necessary steps to mitigate the attack and are closely following and analysing the situation,\u201d the statement said.  Reuters has previously documented how hackers linked to Iran, Vietnam, North Korea, South Korea, China, and Russia have on separate occasions been accused by cybersecurity experts or government officials of trying to steal information about the virus and its potential treatments. Cybercriminals have also been active against health care providers such as hospitals during the pandemic.  IBM\u2019s Zaboeva said there was no shortage of potential suspects. Figuring out how to swiftly distribute an economy-saving vaccine \u201cshould be topping the lists of nation states across the world,\u201d she said.","186":"Booking Holdings and its Priceline, Kayak and OpenTable sites did not infringe an IBM patent on technology for speeding up the display of advertisements on a user\u2019s computer, a divided federal appeals court held on Wednesday.
