The Santa Clara, California-based company said its GeForce RTX 3090, 3080 and 3070 chips will improve video game graphics with twice the performance and nearly twice the power efficiency of previous versions.  Nvidia has long worked with a variety of chip manufacturers to fabricate its devices, and more recently has relied on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW for its most advanced chips.  Samsung will make the new GeForce chips with its 8-nanometer chipmaking process rather than its latest 5nm process. However, Nvidia officials said they worked with Samsung to customize the process so that Nvidia chips will be about 10% faster than other Samsung-made chips manufactured with the same 8nm process.  \u201cProcess technology is a lot more complex than a number. I think people have simplified it down to almost a ridiculous level,\u201d Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told investors on a conference call last month, explaining why the company does not always use the newest chipmaking technology.  Nvidia\u2019s chips use a number of technologies to boost graphics performance, such as using an artificial intelligence processor to make predictions about how light rays should move in a scene rather than manually calculating each ray.  The newest chips also use memory technology that Micron has been developing since 2006 called GDDR6X to double the amount of data that can be shoveled into Nvidia\u2019s chip for processing.  \u201cUnlike traditional memory, GDDR6X has unparalleled data rates that can keep pace with gaming innovation and data-hungry applications,\u201d said Tom Eby, senior vice president and general manager of the compute and networking business unit at Micron.","5":"Nov 18 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp forecast fourth-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, betting on robust demand for its graphic chips for gaming devices and data centers.

FILE PHOTO: A Volvo logo is pictured on the stand during the 87th International Motor Show at Palexpo in Geneva, Switzerland, March 7, 2017. REUTERS\/Denis Balibouse  The agreement announced on Tuesday by Nvidia and Volvo, the world\u2019s second-biggest truckmaker after Daimler AG, is a long-term partnership spanning several years. Work will begin immediately in Santa Clara, California, and Gothenburg, Sweden. Financial terms were not disclosed.  Volvo, which last year demonstrated its first cabin-less autonomous truck, Vera, said the partnership would develop a flexible, scalable self-driving system, which is planned to be used first in pilot schemes before commercial deployment.  \u201cThe resulting system is designed to safely handle fully autonomous driving on public roads and highways,\u201d Volvo said in a statement.  Nvidia, known for its powerful gaming graphics chips, has been aggressively expanding into the automotive sphere, where trucks - with their regular routes that are easier to automate than cars navigating traffic - may lead the way in self-driving.  Nvidia dominates the fast-growing AI chip market alongside Intel Corp.  Tesla, Ford Motor Co, Daimler and several startups are racing each other towards autonomy, using closed-area pilots such as warehouse-to-warehouse delivery or mining-site operations to speed up testing and commercialization.  Volvo\u2019s first commercial autonomous technology will move into real operation from pilot mode in winter this year.  Seven Volvo FH16 trucks will transport limestone for Norway\u2019s Broennoey Kalk AS from a mine to a nearby port, Volvo Trucks\u2019 autonomous solutions director, Sasko Cuklev said, on Tuesday.  \u201cThis coming winter, Volvo Trucks\u2019 autonomous mining solution will be in operation and we will get paid per transported tonne,\u201d Cuklev said at the company\u2019s annual general meeting in Gothenburg.  He said the seven trucks, together with a site management system, truck services and support, workshop set-up and insurance would be wrapped together to make Volvo\u2019s first commercial autonomous transport package.  Volvo Chief Technology Officer Lars Stenqvist said he preferred not to set a firm date for when a self-driving Volvo truck using Nvidia technology would travel a public highway. Deployment will start in areas that are not open to the public and \u201cgradually grow into more complex situations,\u201d he told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday. \u201cWe are humble as to the challenges we have.\u201d  Morgan Stanley analysts said last month that Nvidia-backed startup TuSimple had secured 12 customers that were generating revenue. TuSimple last month said it had begun testing for the U.S. Postal Service.  PILOT PROJECT  Nvidia, which has previously announced technology partnerships with automakers including Volkswagen AG, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota Motor Corp , said it was thrilled to team up with Volvo.  \u201cThe latest breakthroughs in AI and robotics bring a new level of intelligence and automation to address the transportation challenges we face,\u201d Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told reporters on a conference call.  Huang emphasized that for Nvidia the partnership with Volvo goes beyond supplying chips, and includes work on developing software, on-board computers and sensor systems for autonomous commercial vehicles. \u201cThe technology inside the vehicle is much more significant than we would apply\u201d to a consumer-owned car, he said.  Volvo said last week its Vera self-driving truck would begin transporting goods from a logistics center to a port terminal in Gothenburg in collaboration with logistics firm DFDS, in a first step towards operations on public roads. Systems designed under the partnership with Nvidia would be used to develop vehicles capable of operating on public streets, Stenqvist said.  Nvidia\u2019s so-called Drive Constellation chips often power the machine learning used to refine self-driving car software algorithms inside data centers, and the company has also been working to build its Drive chips into cars.  Automotive chips accounted for $641 million of Nvidia\u2019s $11.7 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year.  Tesla was previously a major customer for Nvidia\u2019s automotive chips but last year CEO Elon Musk said the electric-car pioneer was developing its own chip.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.18 per share in the quarter compared with analysts\u2019 estimates of $1.97 per share.  Nvidia was once primarily known for chips that helped video game graphics look more realistic. But more than a decade ago, Huang placed a major bet on the rise of artificial intelligence applications such as the image recognition or natural language processing computing that powers everything from autonomous vehicle development to voice assistants.  The rise of those technologies helped make Nvidia the biggest U.S. chip company by market capitalization in July, when it overtook Intel, which has long dominated chips for both personal computers and inside data centers.  In recent weeks, Intel shares have plunged nearly 20% as the company struggles with its chip manufacturing operations while Nvidia shares have continued to rise, leaving Nvidia with a market cap of $301.6 billion before markets closed Wednesday compared with Intel\u2019 $206.9 billion.","23":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of SoftBank Group Corp is displayed at SoftBank World 2017 conference in Tokyo, Japan, July 20, 2017.

The $326 billion semiconductor firm is riding a wave of demand for its gaming and data center chips, and the pandemic has provided a bit of extra swell for both. But its suppliers are struggling to keep up, which not only limits its current potential. It puts future sales \u2013 and valuation \u2013 at risk, too.  The company specializes in creating chips that do many simple tasks simultaneously. These have highly sophisticated uses, like making computer graphics more lifelike or helping data centers go through torrents of information. The result is steadily increasing demand for Nvidia\u2019s products, which has reached a fever pitch during the pandemic. Revenue from its gaming division rose 37% compared with last year, while sales in its data center division grew 162% compared to the same quarter last year.  The trouble is Nvidia could have done better, if it weren\u2019t for a few snags out of its control. Its suppliers can\u2019t produce Nvidia-designed gaming chips fast enough. So there was even more demand than it could meet. That should gradually improve, but for now Nvidia is leaving money on the table.  This supply-demand mismatch happens often enough in the chips sector, too. And so its earnings this quarter were partly flattered by a large order from a Chinese company, who may have also been getting head of a supply crunch. Nvidia doesn\u2019t think this order will reoccur, so it estimates data center sales will actually fall slightly in the coming quarter.  Nvidia\u2019s stock now trades 16 times higher than it did just five years ago, and at nearly 50 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months according to Refinitiv \u2013 nearly triple the multiple of peers. The company\u2019s future is undoubtedly bright, and founder Jensen Huang is one of the best at discerning semiconductor trends, but the company\u2019s valuation leaves little room for disappointment.","25":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O said on Monday it will use chipmaker Nvidia Corp's NVDA.O real-time ray tracing technology to provide the software company's Minecraft video game players more realistic graphics on personal computers.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Nvidia Corporation is seen during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan May 30, 2017. REUTERS\/Tyrone Siu\/File Photo  The Santa Clara, California-based company also posted sales that missed expectations for its third quarter. Shares plunged nearly 17 percent in late trading to $168.32.  For decades, Nvidia has supplied gaming cards to boost computer graphics, but in recent years cryptocurrency miners adopted the company\u2019s cards to turn bits into wealth.  Chief Executive Jensen Huang said prices for Nvidia\u2019s gaming cards had risen with the cryptocurrency frenzy, driving some buyers away. As the frenzy receded and card prices came down, Nvidia expected sales volumes to grow again as buyers who were priced out came back.  But that process was slower than Nvidia expected, Huang said, saying he expects inventories to be at normal levels by the end of the current quarter.  \u201cThe crypto hangover lasted longer than we expected,\u201d Huang said on a conference call. \u201cWe thought we had done a better job managing the cryptocurrency dynamics,\u201d he later added.  As a result, Nvidia stopped shipping some of its mid-priced chips to retailers, where they are stacking up in warehouses and the backs of stores. The company said its provision for inventories expanded more than five-fold in the fiscal third quarter to $70 million, and that the same provision had more than tripled for the first nine months of its fiscal year to $124 million.  The provisions for inventory lowered Nvidia\u2019s gross margins by 1.8 percentage points in the quarter to 60.4 percent, though margins were still up from 59.5 percent a year earlier. Margins were also held down by $57 million in charges related to its previous generations of chips following the sharp fall-off in cryptocurrency mining demand.  Nvidia also said that its revenue derived from personal computer makers decreased by almost 40 percent because of lower demand for GPU products targeted for use in cryptocurrency mining.  Nvidia said it expected current-quarter revenue of $2.7 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, well below analysts\u2019 average estimate of $3.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Kinngai Chan, analyst at Summit Insights Group, said the problem was that inventories of Nvidia\u2019s older gaming chips, based on a technology it calls Pascal, were piling up even as demand for new chips released in August was weaker than expected. Chan also said demand was faltering for Nvidia\u2019s chips in data centers, where they are often used for artificial intelligence work such as teaching computers to recognize images.  \u201cBut we too are surprised at the below-$3 billion outlook\u201d for the fourth quarter, Chan said.  The trade conflict between the United States and China may also be weighing on Nvidia, analysts said. Tariffs on many Chinese-made goods will rise to 25 percent starting Jan. 1.  \u201cNvidia\u2019s inventory build-up is suggesting that the escalating tariffs have started to pinch producers,\u201d said Haris Anwar, analyst at Investing.com.  In an interview with Reuters, Huang said tariffs were \u201cnot really a factor\u201d and that the fallout from the cryptocurrency decline was the sole reason for the inventory build.  Last month, rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O blamed dwindling demand for chips from cryptocurrency miners for its lower-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue forecast. AMD's shares sank 7 percent after Nvidia posted results after the market closed Thursday. Shares of chipmaker Micron Technology Inc MU.O, which sells memory to Nvidia for its gaming cards, sank 3.3 percent in late trading.  Revenue from Nvidia\u2019s closely watched data center chips business rose 58 percent to $792 million, but missed analysts\u2019 estimate of $820.4 million, according to FactSet.  The business powers cloud computing services of customers including Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Azure as well as Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Cloud.  During the investor call, analysts noted that those companies seem to be slowing their overall spending on data centers. Huang told Reuters that the specific uses for Nvidia\u2019s chips such as machine learning were still expanding.  \u201cOur overall penetration of the world\u2019s data centers is still relatively small,\u201d Huang said. Nvidia\u2019s net income rose to $1.23 billion, or $1.97 per share, in the third-quarter ended Oct. 28, from $838 million, or $1.33 per share, a year earlier.

The company\u2019s share price rose 6 percent in early trading on Friday after at least 14 Wall Street brokerages raised their price targets on the stock - a measure of the confidence around the stock among sector analysts.  Gamers use GPUs to play high-quality video games, but Nvidia\u2019s high-performing cards are also now used by those building machines to solve the complex math puzzles used to validate transactions and earn more of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and bitcoin.  The company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call on Thursday that inventory levels for gaming GPUs were at historically low levels due to cryptocurrency miners.  \u201cWe do think that cryptocurrency has been a very significant factor in both revenue and pricing, creating a shortage environment that is boosting pricing,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a note after the results.  Analysts also say Nvidia\u2019s competitive advantage is only likely to increase when it moves its Volta chip architecture, launched last year and only currently present in data-center GPUs, into gaming chips later this year.  The new GPU gaming chip, code named Turing, is expected to be unveiled next month. Even without it, Nvidia\u2019s revenue from gaming rose 29 percent to $1.74 billion in the fourth quarter, accounting for more than half of its total revenue.  The company's quarterly data center revenue - powered by the Volta-based data center GPU, Tesla V100 - more than doubled to $606 million as companies such as Alibaba BABA.N, Amazon AMZN.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O, IBM IBM.N and Microsoft MSFT.O adopted the new chip in their servers.  Data centers outperformed despite high expectations and Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis said they should do so again given that Volta is in the early stages of adoption.  One pocket of concern was an 8 percent fall in automotive revenue quarter over quarter.  Auto revenue was down as auto infotainment was becoming commoditized and the company is going through a revenue transition phase to ramping its autonomous driving platforms in volume likely in 2019, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore said.","46":"(Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia Corp said on Tuesday it has suspended self-driving tests across the globe, a week after an Uber Technologies Inc autonomous vehicle struck and killed a woman crossing a street in Arizona.  A NVIDIA logo is shown at SIGGRAPH 2017 in Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 31, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Uber is one of Nvidia\u2019s partners and uses some of its self-driving technology. Nvidia\u2019s shares closed down 7.8 percent at $225.52, wiping out more than $11 billion in market value.  Nvidia shares have more than doubled in value in the past 12 months on bets that the company will become a leader in chips for driverless cars, data centers and artificial intelligence.  Uber suspended North American tests of its autonomous vehicles after the fatal collision on March 18 in Tempe, Arizona. And Arizona on Monday suspended permission for Uber to test self-driving vehicles on public streets.  The California Department of Motor Vehicles said on Tuesday that Uber indicated it would not renew its current permit to test autonomous vehicles in California.  Under current terms, Uber is allowed to test autonomous vehicles on California public roads until March 31.  Uber should be given a chance to understand what went wrong, Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said at the company\u2019s annual GPU Conference in San Jose, California. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d  In addition, Huang said he expected investments in self-driving technology would rise, not fall, in the aftermath of the Uber fatality.  Nvidia leads the autonomous industry with its artificial intelligence platform and has partnered with major global automakers such as Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Tesla Inc and Audi AG.  Nvidia has been conducting testing of self-driving cars around the globe, including in Santa Clara, California; New Jersey, Japan and Germany,  \u201cOur global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate,\u201d a company spokesman said.  Reuters earlier on Tuesday reported about the test suspension, citing a source.  \"Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being,\" Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics, wrote in a blog post bit.ly\/2GaIBCN on Tuesday.  The Nvidia DRIVE platform is used by over 370 companies developing self-driving technology, including automakers and robotaxi companies and makers of self-driving hardware, such as sensors, Huang said on Tuesday.  Analyst Kinngai Chan from Summit Insight Group said he does not expect the suspension to hurt Nvidia\u2019s earnings.  The question is whether it would be one or two years before fully autonomous vehicles are ready, Chan said, adding if it is pushed out further then the multiple for stock needs to come down as the valuation is very high.  Nvidia trades at 37.60 times forward 12-month earnings, compared with 18.92 for its peer group.  Nvidia, which generates the bulk of its revenue from chips used in gaming and data centers, reported automotive revenue of $132 million in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 28. That mainly consists of revenue from infotainment and development agreements for self-driving cars.","47":"SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp unveiled on Tuesday a simulator that leverages cloud computing power to test autonomous vehicles, the latest move involving driverless cars that has helped more than double the chipmaker\u2019s stock in the past 12 months.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Silicon Valley firm is ubiquitous in the budding self-driving technology sector, with ongoing partnerships with automakers, technology companies and auto suppliers, including Tesla Inc, Uber Technologies Inc, China's Baidu Inc and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE.  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company\u2019s annual GPU Conference in San Jose that the cloud-based system, Nvidia DRIVE Constellation, was based on two different servers, with no need for a physical car. One server simulates the vehicle\u2019s many sensors, and the other runs the vehicle\u2019s software to process the simulated data.  Nvidia has said that using simulation, some 300,000 miles (483,000 km) can be driven in five hours, essentially every paved road in the United States simulated in just two days.  The technology is designed to allow automakers and others to validate their technology on billions of driving miles and increase the strength of their algorithms by repeatedly testing difficult scenarios, which would be impractical in the real world.  The software can simulate glare at sunset, snowstorms, poor road surfaces and dangerous situations to test the vehicle\u2019s ability to react.  Questions over the safety of self-driving cars are swirling in the wake of a fatality involving an Uber self-driving vehicle in Arizona.  Companies generally supplement their real-world driving by simulations, which allow them to cover more miles and so-called tricky \u201cedge cases\u201d more efficiently and more cheaply.  The Nvidia DRIVE platform is now used by over 370 companies developing self-driving technology, including automakers and robotaxi companies and those making self-driving hardware, such as sensors, said Huang.  Bets that Nvidia will become a leader in chips for driverless cars, data centers and artificial intelligence have sent its shares up 26 percent since the beginning of the year.","48":"June 23 (Reuters) - Semiconductor maker Nvidia Corp said on Tuesday it struck a deal with Germany\u2019s Daimler Mercedes-Benz to provide cars produced from 2024 with a chip and software platform that can eventually be used for autonomous driving functions.  \u201cWe intend to join forces to create a software-defined vehicle and deploy this across the entire next generation\u2019s fleet,\u201d Nvidia Senior Director of Automotive Danny Shapiro told reporters.  Shapiro declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal. The deal covers chips and software for the vehicle system.  The new partnership followed Daimler\u2019s move last week to pause a development alliance with rival German luxury carmaker BMW in the area of automated driving.  Shapiro said the high-end Nvidia Drive AGX Orin Platform - an autonomous vehicle processor - would be standard in every Mercedes-Benz vehicle. With that in place, consumers will be able to update the car\u2019s software the way smartphones are updated today.  Asked how the Mercedes-Benz partnership will affect Nvidia\u2019s decade-long collaboration with Audi AG, Shapiro said neither arrangement was exclusive. With Mercedes-Benz there is \u201ca huge dedication, huge energy, huge investment from both companies to bring this to market,\u201d he said.  Mercedes-Benz sold 2.39 million cars worldwide in 2019. The two companies have been working together on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence car technology for over five years.

Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su, during a keynote address at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, gave a preview of AMD\u2019s third-generation Ryzen CPU chips for desktop users.  The Ryzen CPU chips will be launched in the middle of this year and will compete with Intel\u2019s PC processors.  AMD will start shipping its Radeon VII (seven) graphics chips, which compete with Nvidia\u2019s gaming chips, from Feb. 7 and the next generation of EPYC server chips in mid-2019, Su said.  All the three chips are based on AMD\u2019s partners\u2019 new 7nm manufacturing technology that packs more transistors on smaller chips and can boost performance at lower power.  AMD\u2019s longtime manufacturing partner Global Foundries last year said it would quit trying to develop such advanced manufacturing techniques on its own, and AMD said it would move all of its 7-nanometer production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, which analysts also believe is making 7nm chips for Apple Inc.  AMD\u2019s EPYC server chips and the Ryzen CPU chips are based on Zen 2 architecture, an advancement over its Zen chips that was launched in 2017, establishing the chipmaker as an equal, if not better than Intel in terms of chip performance, according to many tech websites.  For Intel, which has faced production delays for its 10nm-based chips, this could mean a loss of market share to AMD, analysts have said. Intel has said it expects to ship 10nm PC chips later this year and 10nm server chips early next year.  During the keynote, Su showed that Ryzen III consumed 30 percent less power than Intel\u2019s Core i9 CPU chip.  Intel, the world\u2019s biggest maker of computing chips for personal computers and data centers, has been a leader in manufacturing the tiniest chips so far but recently lost its title to Taiwan Semiconductor.  Su also announced that Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google was partnering to use AMD\u2019s Radeon graphics chips on its recently announced video game streaming service, Project Stream.","51":"(Reuters) - Chip maker Nvidia Corp on Thursday forecast sales for its current fiscal year that topped Wall Street expectations, sending its shares up 8 percent in late trading.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Santa Clara, California-based company said it expected revenues for its fiscal 2020 year to be \u201cflat or down slightly\u201d from the $11.7 billion it recorded in the just-ended fiscal year. The forecast exceeds the $10.8 billion in revenue that analysts expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Fourth-quarter revenues fell for Nvidia, which supplies chips for gaming computers and artificial intelligence work and is coming off record highs early last when demand for its chips for mining crypto currencies sent sales soaring.  The just-ended fiscal year was Nvidia\u2019s best ever, with sales up more than 21 percent from a year earlier, but sputtered to what Chief Executive Jensen Huang called a \u201cdisappointing finish.\u201d  Over the course of the fiscal year, demand for chips for mining vanished and a slowdown in China dampened Nvidia sales.  \u201cBut the China economy is in the final analysis a growth economy, so we\u2019re looking forward to it recovering,\u201d Huang said on a conference call with investors. \u201cAnd gaming is one of the most important pastimes of their culture.\u201d  Nvidia reported profit for the fiscal fourth-quarter ended Jan. 27 above Wall Street estimates. Its outlook for the 2020 fiscal first quarter missed analyst expectations only slightly and its data center business, where it competes against Intel Corp, did not fall as far as analysts had feared.  \u201cNot-as-bad-as-feared has replaced the better-than-expected for a lot of companies this earnings season,\u201d analyst Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners said.  Nvidia has entered into newer growth areas such as data centers and self-driving cars as it looks beyond its bread-and-butter business of selling chips that enhance video game graphics. Analysts had been concerned about Nvidia\u2019s fast-growing data business because Intel, the biggest supplier of chips used in data centers, last month gave a lower-than-expected sales forecast on slower buying from cloud computing customers, especially in China.  But Nvidia\u2019s data center business appeared to be spared from that slowdown, bringing in $679 million in the fourth quarter. That was lower than the year before, but slightly ahead of analyst expectations, according to data from FactSet.  \u201cThere was just a level of cautiousness across all of the enterprise customers and the cloud service providers that we\u2019ve not experienced in a while,\u201d Huang said on the call. \u201cIt has to be temporary. The computing needs of Earth have certainly not been satisfied with what we shipped last quarter.\u201d  Nvidia has grown at a rapid pace in the past few years, but a slowdown in China and a fading cyrptocurrency craze have started to weigh on its sales. Fourth-quarter total revenue fell to $2.21 billion from $2.91 billion, but came above its already lowered estimate of $2.20 billion.  The chip designer forecast first-quarter revenue of $2.20 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, for the quarter. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $2.28 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  But while the first-quarter forecast lagged expectations, Nvidia\u2019s stronger-than-expected full-year forecast suggests the company is expecting a significant increase in sales in the second half of its fiscal year, said Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group.  The company\u2019s net income fell to $567 million, or 92 cents per share, in the fourth-quarter ended Jan. 27, from $1.12 billion, or $1.78 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Nvidia earned 80 cents per share, above analysts\u2019 estimates of 75 cents.

Nvidia told reporters that e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and search engine provider Baidu Inc have started using its chips to run systems that make recommendations to users with the aim of increasing the number of times users click on those recommendations.  Nvidia also said ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing has adopted its chips both for developing self-driving cars on the road as well as in its back-end data centers.  The Santa Clara, California-based chip supplier plans to officially announce the deals at an event on Wednesday in the Chinese city of Suzhou northwest of Shanghai.  Nvidia got its start supplying chips to improve videogame graphics on personal computers, but in recent years much of its growth has come from the use of its chips for artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and other new areas.  Making recommendations - whether on a restaurant or product that a user might like - has long been a challenging artificial intelligence problem. In a Wednesday press release, Alibaba officials said click-through rates improved by about 10% using Nvidia\u2019s chips.  \u201cThe problem of recommendation is related to the explosion of choice,\u201d Paresh Kharya, Nvidia\u2019s director of product management for accelerated computing, told reporters at a briefing ahead of Nvidia\u2019s event. \u201cTo recommend the right product to the right user at the right time, you need to model the user\u2019s preferences and it takes a lot of different variables to model user preferences.  Nvidia also said Didi would use its chips in computing systems in autonomous cars on the road that help drive the vehicles, as well as in back-end data centers where data gathered by test vehicles is used to train algorithms for self-driving cars.  At its event, Nvidia also plans to announce tools that will let participating car makers from Germany, China and North America learn from each others\u2019 training data without having to share data directly - a system called \u201cfederated\u201d learning.  \u201cThis is a way to aggregate different types of data sets form different companies,\u201d Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia, said at the briefing. \u201cThe key thing here is that each (carmaker) or each region can maintain and protect their own data. It\u2019s owned wholly. It\u2019s not shared.\u201d (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Christopher Cushing)","54":"(Repeats story published Thursday to widen distribution)  Aug 17 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp dominates chips for training computers to think like humans, but it faces an entrenched competitor in a major avenue for expansion in the artificial intelligence chip market: Intel Corp.  Nvidia chips dominate the AI training chip market, where huge amounts of data help algorithms \u201clearn\u201d a task such how to recognize a human voice, but one of the biggest growth areas in the field will be deploying computers that implement the \u201clearned\u201d tasks. Intel dominates data centers where such tasks are likely to be carried out.  \u201cFor the next 18 to 24 months, it\u2019s very hard to envision anyone challenging Nvidia on training,\u201d said Jon Bathgate, analyst and tech sector co-lead at Janus Henderson Investors.  But Intel processors already are widely used for taking a trained artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by scanning incoming audio and translating that into text-based requests, what is called \u201cinference.\u201d  Intel\u2019s chips can still work just fine there, especially when paired with huge amounts of memory, said Bruno Fernandez-Ruiz, chief technology officer of Nexar Inc, an Israeli startup using smartphone cameras to try to prevent car collisions.  That market could be bigger than the training market, said Abhinav Davuluri, an analyst at Morningstar, who sees an inference market of $11.8 billion by 2021, versus $8.2 billion for training. Intel estimates that the current market for AI chips is about $2.5 billion, evenly split between inference and training.  Nvidia, which posted an 89 percent rise in profit Thursday, hasn\u2019t given a specific estimate for the inference chip market but CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call with analysts on Thursday that believes it \u201cis going to be a very large market for us.\u201d  Nvidia sales of inference chips are rising. In May, the company said it had doubled its shipments of them year-over-year to big data center customers, though it didn\u2019t give a baseline. Earlier this month, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Cloud unit said it had adopted Nvidia\u2019s inference chips and would rent them out to customers.  But Nvidia faces a headwind selling inference chips because the data center market is blanketed with the CPUs Intel has been selling for 20 years. Intel is working to persuade customers that for both technical and business reasons, they should stick with what they have.  Take Taboola, a New York-based company that helps web publishers recommend related content to readers and that Intel has touted as an example of how its chips remain competitive.  The company uses Nvidia\u2019s training chips to teach its algorithm to learn what to recommend and considered Nvidia\u2019s inference chips to make the recommendations. Speed matters because users leave slow-loading pages.  But Taboola ended up sticking with Intel for reasons of speed and cost, said Ariel Pisetzky, the company\u2019s vice president of information technology.  Nvidia\u2019s chip was far faster, but time spent shuffling data back and forth to the chip negated the gains, Pisetzky said. Second, Intel dispatched engineers to help Taboola tweak its computer code so that the same servers could handle more than twice as many requests.  \u201cMy options were, you already have the servers. They\u2019re in the racks,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking with Intel, I can now cut back my new server purchases by a factor of two because I can use my existing servers two times better.\u201d  Nvidia has been working to solve those challenges. The company has rolled out software this year to make its inference chips far faster to help overcome the issue of moving data back and forth. And it announced a new family of chips based on a technology called Turing earlier this week that it says will be 10 times faster still, Huang said on the analyst call Thursday.  \u201cWe are actively working with just about every single Internet service provider in the world to incorporate inference acceleration into their stack,\u201d Huang said. He gave the example that \u201cvoice recognition is only useful if it responds in a relatively short period of time. And our platform is just really, really excellent for that.\u201d (Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker)","55":"(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp NVDA.O on Thursday joined rival Intel Corp INTC.O to predict strong demand for chips used in data centers after its third-quarter revenue and profit beat market expectations.

Arm\u2019s blueprints for powering chipsets are a critical component for many Chinese smartphone makers and AI firms and China is expected to take a dim view of an American company having so much sway in an industry it has prioritised in its battle for tech supremacy with the United States.  \u201cAnything that creates more concentration in the industry to the benefit of a U.S. company, I would think that\u2019s not aligned with what China wants, said Art Dicker, director at Shanghai-based R&P China Lawyers.  China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation, which has to give the go ahead for the deal alongside other regulators globally, did not respond to a request for comment.  Stewart Randall, who tracks China\u2019s chip sector at Shanghai-based consultancy Intralink, said that the acquisition, one of the largest semiconductor takeovers ever, will prompt many Chinese chipmakers to look for and develop alternatives to Arm.  However, while a handful of options exist such as other open source technologies RISC-V and MIPS, most can\u2019t currently compete with Arm\u2019s mature ecosystem, tech experts say.  An executive from one Chinese startup said it had been looking at moving away from Arm for some time but considered it too much trouble. Now, he said, they plan to accelerate efforts.  Meanwhile, Arm\u2019s ownership by an American company also raises the possibility that Washington could place restrictions on its business in China, industry experts said.  The chief executives of Nvidia and Arm told Reuters in an interview that Nvidia will retain Arm\u2019s United Kingdom headquarters - which exempt it from many U.S. export control laws - and open licensing model.  Chinese companies including Alibaba and Huawei are members of the RISC-V foundation, an open-source project that originated at the University of California, Berkeley and which many experts see as a potential beneficiary of any retreat from Arm.  China\u2019s government has also been pouring money into its domestic chip sector in hopes of fostering companies that can rival giants from the United States, South Korea, and Japan.  Beijing helped close a 204 billion yuan ($28.9 billion) fund last year to finance semiconductor companies, after raising a nearly 140 billion yuan fund in 2014.  CLIENTS AND COMPLICATIONS  A key supplier to Apple, Arm does not make chips but licenses an instruction set architecture - the most fundamental intellectual property underpinning computing chips.  According to the company\u2019s most recent public filing before it was acquired by Softbank Group Corp in 2016, it generated about one-fifth of its revenue from China, where semiconductor startups have mushroomed in recent years.  First as a publicly traded British company and then as a unit of Japan\u2019s SoftBank, Arm\u2019s ownership was not an issue for China.  Huawei\u2019s Hisilicon chip unit used Arm designs to build its Kirin chips before Washington\u2019s trade restrictions on the Chinese company crippled the division, while Unisoc, a chipmaker owned by China\u2019s state-backed tech conglomerate Tsinghua Unigroup, counts on the company\u2019s blueprints.  They are used too by more specialised firms such as Shenzhen Goodix Technology Co Ltd, which makes chips for the internet of things, and Horizon Robotics, a Beijing-based startup maker of automotive chips valued at $3 billion in early 2019. The two companies did not respond to a request for comment.  Smartphone brands such as Oppo and Xiaomi Corp indirectly rely on Arm as purchasers of chips based on its designs made by Qualcomm and MediaTek. Both companies declined to comment.  Further complicating the deal is a corporate dispute between Allen Wu CEO of Arm\u2019s China JV, and the unit\u2019s parent company.  In June this year, Arm issued a statement saying that Wu had stepped down from his role, while Arm China has said Wu retains his position.

Shares of Caterpillar, the world\u2019s largest heavy equipment maker, fell 8.1 percent as its quarterly profit widely missed Wall Street estimates, hit by softening demand in China, a strong dollar, and higher manufacturing and freight costs. The company\u2019s full-year earnings outlook also fell short of estimates.  Caterpillar was the biggest drag on the Dow and the S&P industrials index, which dropped 1.6 percent.  Nvidia slid 16 percent after the chipmaker cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars, hit by weak demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected datacenter sales.

As signs of a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy become stark, investors are pinning their hopes for a compromise between Washington and Beijing on trade when officials meet later this week.  The downbeat mood kept the 11 major S&P sectors and all the 30 Dow components in the red.  The S&P energy index dropped 1.6 percent as oil prices fell more than 2 percent after U.S. companies added rigs for the first time this year, a signal that crude output may rise further.  At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 371.95 points, or 1.50 percent, at 24,365.25, the S&P 500 was down 34.96 points, or 1.31 percent, at 2,629.80 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 123.76 points, or 1.73 percent, at 7,041.11.  Washington\u2019s move to end the 35-day long government shutdown boosted Wall Street on Friday. However, anxiety over another closure surfaced as President Donald Trump over the weekend expressed skepticism about lawmakers reaching a deal on border security that was acceptable to him.  Although, earnings have largely surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations, helping the S&P 500 climb about 12 percent from its December lows, worries about slowing global growth have tempered expectations and put a lid on stocks.  Of the 113 S&P 500 components that have reported so far, 72.6 percent have beaten profit estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Nvidia, the biggest U.S. chip company by market capitalisation, has agreed to buy Arm from Japan's SoftBank 9984.T for $40 billion.  Dinenage said ministers would consider commitments made by SoftBank and Nvidia to maintain Arm as a successful British business \u201cincredibly carefully\u201d, and the government had already had discussions with the parties involved.  The decision whether to intervene in the deal would be taken by the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport after considering the relevant information, she said.  Arm, the leading tech company in Britain, lost its independence in 2016 when it was sold to SoftBank after the Japanese conglomerate pledged to retain the company\u2019s headquarters in Cambridge, England, and increase jobs.  Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang has made similar commitments.  Arm\u2019s energy-efficient architecture underpins processors made by Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm and others, making the technology ubiquitous in smartphones as well as present in a host of other devices.","65":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - An op-ed in China\u2019s state-backed Global Times on Wednesday said U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp\u2019s planned acquisition of Arm Ltd from Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp was \u201cdisturbing\u201d, urging global regulators to exercise caution as they evaluate it for approval.  \u201cGiven the U.S.-China tensions and U.S. suppression on a range of Chinese technology enterprises, if Arm falls into U.S. hands, Chinese technology companies would certainly be placed at a big disadvantage in the market,\u201d said the op-ed, the author of which was not named.  SoftBank said on Monday it had agreed to sell Britain-based chip designer Arm to Nvidia for as much as $40 billion in a deal set to reshape the global semiconductor landscape.  The Global Times op-ed said Chinese companies put on the U.S. \u201centity list\u201d risk getting cut off from using Arm-based chips, while European companies using Arm might also face difficulties supplying China.  In May 2019, the U.S. department of commerce placed Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd on a list of companies that American firms are barred from supplying and servicing.  Before Nvidia can assume full control of Arm, anti-monopoly regulators in major markets must signal approval of the transaction.  In 2018, U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc reversed its planned acquisition of Netherlands\u2019 NXP Semiconductor NV after Chinese regulators declined to approve it.","66":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com on Wednesday launched a microchip aimed at so-called machine learning, entering a market that both Intel Corp and Nvidia Corp are counting on to boost their earnings in the coming years.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Amazon is one of the largest buyers of chips from Intel and Nvidia, whose semiconductors help power Amazon\u2019s booming cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. But Amazon has started to design its own chips.  Amazon\u2019s so-called \u201cInferentia\u201d chip announced on Wednesday will help with what researchers call inference, which is the process of taking an artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by scanning incoming audio and translating that into text-based requests.  The Amazon chip is not a direct threat to Intel and Nvidia\u2019s business because it will not be selling the chips. Amazon will sell services to its cloud customers that run atop the chips starting next year. If Amazon relies on its own chips, it could deprive both Nvidia and Intel of a major customer.  Intel\u2019s processors currently dominate the market for machine learning inference, which analysts at Morningstar believe will be worth $11.8 billion by 2021. [nL1N1V801B] In September, Nvidia launched its own inference chip to compete with Intel.  In addition to its machine learning chip, Amazon on Monday announced a processor chip for its cloud unit called Graviton. That chip is powered by technology from SoftBank Group Corp-controlled Arm Holdings. Arm-based chips currently power mobile phones, but multiple companies are trying to make them suitable for data centers. [nL2N1W402B] The use of Arm chips in data centers potentially represents a major challenge to Intel\u2019s dominance in that market.  Amazon is not alone among cloud computing vendors in designing its own chips. Alphabet Inc-owned Google\u2019s cloud unit in 2016 unveiled an artificial intelligence chip designed to take on chips from Nvidia.  Custom chips can be expensive to design and produce, and analysts have pointed to such investment driving up research and capital expenses for big tech companies.  Google Cloud executives have said customer demand for Google\u2019s custom chip, the TPU, has been strong. But the chips can be costly to use and require software customization.  Google Cloud charges $8 per hour of access to its TPU chips and as much as $2.48 per hour in the United States for access to Nvidia\u2019s chips, according to Google\u2019s website.","67":"March 27 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp:  * NVIDIA SAYS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDING TESTING OF SELF-DRIVING CARS ON PUBLIC ROADS TO \u201cLEARN FROM THE UBER INCIDENT\u201d  * NVIDIA SAYS GLOBAL FLEET OF MANUALLY DRIVEN DATA COLLECTION VEHICLES CONTINUE TO OPERATE Further company coverage:","68":"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - U.S. chip supplier Nvidia Corp has no plans for further acquisitions for the time being after its nearly $7 billion purchase of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies, its chief executive said on Tuesday.

When asked if he paid too much, he said: \u201cBeyond imagination.\u201d  \u201cBut the company has created amazing technology and has a great future,\u201d he said.

Mellanox makes chips that connect those servers together inside the data center.  \u201cOur strategy is we would like to double down on data centers. The future of computing is heavily focused on data centers,\u201d Huang said.  Nvidia gets about a quarter of its revenue from data centers, with the $2.9 billion in sales in 2018 from the segment growing 52 percent year over year.  Huang noted that following the deal with Mellanox, which is expected to close by the end of the year, there would be no cost cuts and the Mellanox brand would be maintained.  \u201cWe are going to keep every single product line.

The logo of technology company Nvidia is seen at its headquarters in Santa Clara, California February 11, 2015. REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith\/File Photo  At a gathering of graphics professionals on Monday, Nvidia rolled out its newest generation of chip technology, called Turing after the legendary British computer scientist Alan Turing.  The biggest selling point of the chips is an improvement in so-called \u201cray tracing,\u201d or the ability for the chip to simulate how light rays will bounce around in a visual scene.  That task takes so much computing power that designers have to wait while a chip churns through the data to see the results of their work. Nvidia says the new generation of chips will let designers make those changes in real time, which could speed up the creative process - and which Nvidia hopes customers will pay a premium for.  \u201cTuring is Nvidia\u2019s most important innovation in computer graphics in more than a decade,\u201d Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement.  The Santa Clara, California-based company's shares have risen more than 50 percent over the past year, backed by data center chip sales that more than doubled to $1.9 billion its last fiscal year. Nvidia's data center chips power artificial intelligence tasks training computers to recognize images and are increasingly eating away Intel Corp's INTC.O growth opportunities.  And Nvidia\u2019s biggest business, its consumer chips that let video gamers play with improved graphics, grew 35 percent to $5.5 billion in its most recent fiscal year. That growth came from hot gaming titles such Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite and the fact that the chips were adopted by homespun cryptocurrency enthusiasts.  But Nvidia\u2019s middle line of chips, aimed at graphics and design professionals who make films and other digital content, has not fared nearly as well, growing only 11.8 percent last year to $934 million.  Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights and Strategy and a former chip executive, said Nvidia is likely looking to stave off competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O, which is likely to target the same group of professional users with its new graphics chips next year. Nvidia's existing strength in the data center market and the high-end gaming market have left it most open to attack in the middle of the market.  \u201cWhere Nvidia gets the biggest bump right now (from a new chip generation) is in the workstation market, which makes it all that more competitive,\u201d Moorhead said.","70":"FILE PHOTO: United States Postal Service mail clerks sort packages at the Lincoln Park carriers annex in Chicago, November 29, 2012.

The company\u2019s bleak outlook for cryptocurrency chips was a sharp reversal from the prior fiscal quarter, when sales to so-called miners of digital currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum amounted to $289 million, nearly a 10th of Nvidia\u2019s revenue. Nvidia previously had forecast sales for cryptocurrency chips for the fiscal second quarter ended July 29 of about $100 million. On Thursday it reported actual revenue of only $18 million.  \u201cWe benefited in the last several quarters from an unusual lift from crypto,\u201d CEO Jensen Huang said on a conference call with analysts, \u201cbut at this time, we consider it to be immaterial for the second half\u201d of the fiscal year.  It projected third-quarter revenue of $3.25 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, falling short of analyst estimates of $3.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Ahead of a conference call with analysts, shares were down 3.6 percent to $248, still quadruple their value two years ago. Shares of Nvidia's chief rival in the graphics chip market, Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O, have also been whipsawed by swings in the cryptocurrency markets.  Analysts were troubled by Nvidia\u2019s gross margin forecast of 62.8 percent, slightly below expectations of 62.9 percent and possibly a result of putting more memory modules on its chips.  Analyst KinNgai Chan of Summit Insights Group said Nvidia shares were likely to trade lower as analysts reset their expectations around slower growth rates.  The cryptocurrency news and the lower-than-expected forecast clouded an otherwise strong quarter, including Nvidia's sales of chips to data centers, where companies such as Amazon.com's AMZN.O Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Azure as well as Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Cloud are buying up the chip to power artificial intelligence and other functions.  Nvidia\u2019s largest and oldest business of selling graphical processing units, or GPUs, for video game players beat analyst estimates, bringing in $1.8 billion compared with estimates of $1.75 billion, according to data from FactSet.  Analysts had braced for lower gaming chip sales because Nvidia is widely expected to unveil a new generation of gaming chips ahead of the holiday shopping seasons, possibly as soon as next week. Gamers typically hold off on purchasing chips when new models are just around the corner.  Revenue from the company\u2019s closely watched data center chips business rose 83 percent to $760 million, topping analysts\u2019 estimate of $743.6 million, according to FactSet.

Arm is the most important technology company in Britain, and one of a handful of European tech groups that operate on a global scale. Its energy-efficient designs dominate the smartphone sector, with its licensees including Apple shipping 180 billion chips to date.  It was sold in 2016 to Japan\u2019s SoftBank after the conglomerate pledged to retain Arm\u2019s headquarters in Cambridge, England, and increase jobs - a commitment that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reiterated on Monday.  \u201cWe want to grow Arm and make it become even greater,\u201d Huang told analysts on a call, adding Arm would hire more engineers, spend more on research, and run a new artificial intelligence research centre in Cambridge.  \u201cThe UK government will realise that we are making a very significant investment in the UK,\u201d added Huang. He stopped short, however, of making formal job guarantees and said talks with the UK government had yet to begin in earnest.  A spokesman for Johnson said ministers had spoken to the relevant companies and were looking at what the deal meant for Arm\u2019s Cambridge base.  U.S. SELLOUT?  The deal, announced overnight, drew criticism from Hermann Hauser, a co-founder of Arm who told Reuters in an interview that it would spell disaster for Cambridge, the UK and Europe.  \u201cIt\u2019s the last European technology company with global relevance and it\u2019s being sold to the Americans,\u201d he said.  The deal would, he fears, risk jeopardising Arm\u2019s position as the \u201cSwitzerland of the semiconductor industry\u201d where it allows hundreds of companies such as Apple, Samsung and Qualcomm to develop their own chips using its architecture.  If the company\u2019s British character and open business model could not be protected, it would be better for Johnson to back a flotation on the London Stock Exchange, Hauser said.  COMMITMENTS  Industry and potential anti-trust concerns over the deal relate to the fact that Nvidia competes with hundreds of Arm\u2019s customers, whereas tech investor SoftBank does not.  Nvidia\u2019s Huang said he would retain Arm\u2019s neutral licensing model and expand it by licensing out Nvidia intellectual property for the first time.  The head of Arm, Simon Segar, said a purchase by an American company would not affect which countries it sold to.  Johnson\u2019s government, set to embark on a new industrial strategy as Britain leaves the European Union at the end of this year, could investigate the deal on national security grounds, and request certain undertakings in order for it to pass.  Neil Campling, head of TMT research at Mirabaud, said it was unlikely that Britain would block it.  \u201cI expect Nvidia to give commitments to maintain the intellectual property investment and leadership,\u201d said Campling, adding Nvidia would play up its heft as the world\u2019s most valuable semiconductor company to reassure the UK government.","75":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of SoftBank Group Corp is displayed at SoftBank World 2017 conference in Tokyo, Japan, July 20, 2017.

REUTERS\/Neil Hall  HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Nvidia has played a risky opening chess move. The U.S. listed graphics-chip specialist led by Jensen Huang will buy UK chip designer Arm from SoftBank and its Vision Fund in a deal worth up to $40 billion. But Arm\u2019s customers and regulators may baulk, and the chunky price tag presupposes huge growth and market share gains.  Huang is the industry\u2019s most prescient boss. His track record of moving into promising, fast-growing markets like chips for video games and more recently, data centres, has helped more than triple Nvidia\u2019s market capitalisation to $300 billion since 2019. Now it will pay $21.5 billion in shares and $12 billion in cash for Arm, and an additional $5 billion if the target hits certain financial targets down the line. SoftBank will end up with as much as 8.1% in the enlarged group, which will also issue $1.5 billion worth of stock to Arm employees.  Combining Arm\u2019s computing expertise with its new parent\u2019s technology in artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and more will create a powerful player in booming markets: Nvidia forecasts the addressable market for data centres will hit $80 billion by 2023, for example. Arm\u2019s business model of licensing out intellectual property will also benefit from more R&D as well as from offering Nvidia\u2019s technologies to customers. The deal implies an enterprise value of at least $33.5 billion or, with the earn-out, a decent increase on the $32 billion SoftBank paid in 2016.  Yet Huang will have to stretch to earn a return on Nvidia\u2019s minimum investment of $35 billion, including the stock granted to Arm employees. Nvidia is betting that the considerable investment made by SoftBank into Arm\u2019s operations will help profit ramp up quickly. Even so, on the last fiscal year\u2019s roughly $1.8 billion in sales, Arm made an operating loss. For Nvidia to bag, say, a 10% return, the target will have to generate a massive $4.4 billion in operating profit, assuming a 21% U.S. corporate tax rate, according to a Breakingviews calculation.  Growth will depend on winning over many of Arm\u2019s customers like Intel, which compete with Nvidia, as well as anti-trust regulators around the world. And appeasing politicians will further squeeze returns: Nvidia has pledged to expand Arm\u2019s UK operations as lawmakers there worry about a loss of jobs. Huang\u2019s designs on the chip industry will be tested.  This article has been corrected to show SoftBank paid $32 billion for Arm, and that the sum from Nvidia deal represents a decent increase in the third paragraph.","79":"TOKYO, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Softbank Group Corp on Monday said it has agreed to sell chip designer Arm to Nvidia Corp for as much as $40 billion.

FILE PHOTO: An NVIDIA logo is shown at SIGGRAPH 2017 in Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 31, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Arm\u2019s blueprints for powering chipsets are a critical component for many Chinese smartphone makers and AI firms and China is expected to take a dim view of an American company having so much sway in an industry it has prioritised in its battle for tech supremacy with the United States.  \u201cAnything that creates more concentration in the industry to the benefit of a U.S. company, I would think that\u2019s not aligned with what China wants, said Art Dicker, director at Shanghai-based R&P China Lawyers.  China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation, which has to give the go-ahead for the deal alongside other regulators globally, did not respond to a request for comment.  Shares of Nvidia rose 7.6% on Monday following the announcement.  Stewart Randall, who tracks China\u2019s chip sector at Shanghai-based consultancy Intralink, said that the acquisition, one of the largest semiconductor takeovers ever, will prompt many Chinese chipmakers to look for and develop alternatives to Arm, which is being sold by Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp.  However, while a handful of options exist such as other open-source technologies RISC-V and MIPS, most cannot currently compete with Arm\u2019s mature ecosystem, tech experts say.  An executive from one Chinese startup said it had been looking at moving away from Arm for some time but considered it too much trouble. Now, he said, they plan to accelerate efforts.  Meanwhile, Arm\u2019s ownership by an American company also raises the possibility that Washington could place restrictions on its business in China, industry experts said.  The chief executives of Nvidia and Arm told Reuters in an interview that Nvidia will retain Arm\u2019s United Kingdom headquarters - which exempt it from many U.S. export control laws - and open licensing model.  Britain\u2019s government will scrutinise the deal, including what it might mean for the company\u2019s headquarters in England, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday.  Chinese companies including Alibaba and Huawei [HWT.UL] are members of the RISC-V foundation, an open-source project that originated at the University of California, Berkeley and which many experts see as a potential beneficiary of any retreat from Arm.  China\u2019s government has also been pouring money into its domestic chip sector in hopes of fostering companies that can rival giants from the United States, South Korea and Japan.  Beijing helped close a 204 billion yuan ($28.9 billion) fund last year to finance semiconductor companies, after raising a nearly 140 billion yuan fund in 2014.  CLIENTS AND COMPLICATIONS  A key supplier to Apple, Arm does not make chips but licenses an instruction set architecture - the most fundamental intellectual property underpinning computing chips.  According to the company\u2019s most recent public filing before it was acquired by SoftBank in 2016, it generated about one-fifth of its revenue from China, where semiconductor startups have mushroomed in recent years.  First as a publicly traded British company and then as a unit of Japan\u2019s SoftBank, Arm\u2019s ownership was not an issue for China.  Huawei\u2019s Hisilicon chip unit used Arm designs to build its Kirin chips before Washington\u2019s trade restrictions on the Chinese company crippled the division, while Unisoc, a chipmaker owned by China\u2019s state-backed tech conglomerate Tsinghua Unigroup, counts on the company\u2019s blueprints.  They are used too by more specialised firms such as Shenzhen Goodix Technology Co Ltd, which makes chips for the internet of things, and Horizon Robotics, a Beijing-based startup maker of automotive chips valued at $3 billion in early 2019. The two companies did not respond to a request for comment.  Smartphone brands such as Oppo and Xiaomi Corp indirectly rely on Arm as purchasers of chips based on its designs made by Qualcomm and MediaTek. Both companies declined to comment.  Further complicating the deal is a corporate dispute between Allen Wu, CEO of Arm\u2019s China JV, and the unit\u2019s parent company.  In June this year, Arm issued a statement saying that Wu had stepped down from his role, while Arm China has said Wu retains his position.  Arm and Nvidia say they are confident the dispute will be resolved quickly and will not interfere with the acquisition. Arm China declined to comment on the implications of the acquisition on its business.  Some analysts see Beijing using the uncertain status of Wu\u2019s control of the JV as leverage as it mulls approving the deal, perhaps pushing for a spinoff.  \u201cThe deal would include 47% of Arm China, but what does that mean anymore?\u201d says Intralink\u2019s Randall.  \u201cIf this needs Chinese government regulatory approval, I can\u2019t see it getting it unless they get something big in return.\u201d","83":"July 22 (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp\u2019s chip company Arm Holdings Ltd has gathered buyout interest from Nvidia Corp, CNBC reported on Wednesday, citing Bloomberg News.

Arm\u2019s open approach of licensing its designs to all comers has turned the 160 billion chips sold based on its technology into a huge ecosystem of devices from smart phones to smart toasters.  Nvidia\u2019s deal would put Arm under the control of a U.S.-based combatant amid a battle between the United States and China, which is rushing to develop a domestic semiconductor industry while U.S. officials seek to stem its rise.  Geoff Blaber, vice president of research for the Americas with CCS Insights, said the deal \u201cwill rightly face huge opposition\u201d from Arm\u2019s customers.  \u201cAn acquisition by Nvidia would be detrimental to Arm and its ecosystem,\u201d Blaber said. \u201cIndependence is critical to the ongoing success of Arm and once that is compromised, its value will start to erode.\u201d  Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang and Arm Chief Executive Simon Segars told Reuters in an interview that Nvidia will retain Arm\u2019s United Kingdom headquarters - which exempt it from many U.S. export control laws - and open licensing model.  Huang also said that Nvidia will expand the model by licensing some of Nvidia\u2019s designs - including its graphical processing unit, or GPU, technology - through Arm\u2019s network of silicon partners. That move would in theory allow those companies to compete with Nvidia.

But the deal immediately provoked skepticism in the hours after it was announced.  \u201cChina is going to hate it,\u201d said one Chinese chip executive, noting that American companies working with Arm to create server chips would likely have a harder time selling in China if Arm had an American parent company.

The all-cash offer of $125 per share represents a premium of 14 percent to Mellanox\u2019s closing price on Friday. Mellanox shares rose 8.2 percent to $118.35 and Nvidia shares gained 7 percent to $161.23 on Monday.  Nvidia, once known as a provider of gaming chips, now also provides chips to speed up artificial intelligence tasks such as teaching servers to recognise images. Mellanox makes chips that connect those servers together inside the data centre.  Nvidia bought Mellanox to help stitch those servers together into one giant computer, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told Reuters in an interview.  \u201cWe want to double down on data centres,\u201d he said.  Nvidia gets about a quarter of its revenue from data centres, with the $2.9 billion in sales in 2018 from the segment growing 52 percent year over year. The segment is important as a slowdown in China and a fading cryptocurrency craze have started to weigh on Nvidia\u2019s overall sales in recent quarters.  Nvidia said it believes that market for it and Mellanox is worth about $60 billion: $50 billion for Nvidia\u2019s computing chips and $11 billion for Mellanox\u2019s high-speed networking chips.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  The move could bolster Nvidia against its chief rival in the data centre business, Intel. Known for its computing chips, Intel has steadily added other chips for memory and networking in order to grab a bigger slice of customer spending.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to not think Nvidia is just buying some revenue to help its case\u201d in the data centre space, said Jason Carolan, chief innovation officer of Flexential, which operates data centres for big businesses and is a Nvidia customer. It\u2019s about market share in a segment they\u2019re already in, he said.  The tie-up also builds on efforts at Nvidia and Mellanox to get out of the cutthroat business of selling chips and into the more profitable business of selling complete systems, said Bob Wheeler, a principal analyst at chip research firm The Linley Group.  Nvidia\u2019s DGX system is an artificial intelligence computer in a box, while Mellanox has a growing business selling complete switches, which could be combined with Nvidia\u2019s boxes, Wheeler said.  TIMING  The deal follows a competitive bidding process which according to sources familiar with the matter, included rival chipmakers such as Intel and Xilinx Inc. Mellanox will pay a $350 million termination fee to Nvidia if it accepts a rival offer.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  Reuters reported about the deal on Sunday. Intel declined to comment on whether the company had bid for Mellanox, while Xilinx did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The deal is expected to close by the end of 2019. It could, however, face some regulatory hurdles in China, where Mellanox has major customers such as Alibaba and Baidu. In the wake of its trade row with the United States, China has previously moved to thwart non-Chinese chip M&A deals.  Chinese regulators may require Nvidia to promise that Mellanox\u2019s technology will continue to work with chips from other makers, said Aaron Glick, a strategist with Cowen Inc.  \u201cThey\u2019re in the networking business, and networks are interoperable.

REUTERS\/Tyrone Siu  (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp NVDA.O on Monday laid out a multi-year plan to create a new kind of chip for data centers, aimed at siphoning off more functions from its chief rival Intel Corp INTC.O.  Models with limited features will debut in months, while full-fledged versions are planned within two years, Nvidia said in a press briefing. Server companies such as Dell Technologies DELL.N and Lenovo Group Ltd 0992.HK plan to integrate them into their machines, it added.  Nvidia chips have long been used to improve video game graphics, but in recent years they have helped to speed up artificial intelligence tasks such as image recognition. The chips typically sit alongside an Intel central processor, offloading some of the computing work.  Nvidia is now seeking to grab more tasks with its proposed series of \"data processing unit\" chips. They will combine networking technology acquired with Nvidia's $6.9 billion purchase of Mellanox Technologies Ltd, with artificial intelligence and computing power from Arm Ltd. Nvidia last month agreed to buy Arm from SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T for $40 billion.  Using artificial intelligence, the chips could detect hackers trying to break into a data center, said Manuvir Das, Nvidia\u2019s head of enterprise computing, in the briefing. The chips would review network traffic for unusual patterns and seek to block it proactively.  Previously such functions would have required a combination of chips.","95":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp NVDA.O is close to a deal to buy British chip designer Arm Holdings from SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T for more than $40 billion (\u00a331.26 billion) in a deal which would create a giant in the chip industry, according to two people familiar with the matter.  A cash and stock deal for Arm could be announced as early as next week, the sources said.  Nvidia is known for its graphics chips that power video games, but it has developed other markets including artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and data centers.  Arm supplies the chip technology for virtually all mobile devices such as phones and tablets but is also expanding into processors for cars, datacenter services and other devices.  The British company does not make chips. Instead it licenses out the underlying technology so others can make chips with it. It has previously collaborated with Nvidia.  Last year Nvidia said it would make its chips work with processors from Arm to build supercomputers, deepening its push into systems that are used for modeling both climate change predictions and nuclear weapons.  SoftBank acquired Arm for $32 billion in 2016, its largest-ever purchase, in part to expand into the internet-of-things technology, which connects everyday devices from traffic signals to refrigerators to the internet.  The terms would mark a big win for the Japanese company which has struggled to jump-start growth in the business, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported on the deal earlier.  Nvidia declined to comment. SoftBank and Arm did not respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comments.","96":"FILE PHOTO: An NVIDIA logo is shown at SIGGRAPH 2017 in Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 31, 2017.

GSK and AstraZeneca, which are both involved in coronavirus vaccine research, will be two of the first pharmaceutical companies to harness the power of the machine, Nvidia said.  The Cambridge-1 computer, which is expected to come online by the end of the year in Cambridge, east England, will be a NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD system capable of delivering more than 400 petaflops of AI performance, the company said.  That would mean it ranks 29th on the Top 500 list of the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers, it said.  Cambridge is also home to Arm, the British chip designer that Nvidia has agreed to buy from Japan\u2019s SoftBank for $40 billion.  Nvidia has previously said it intended to create an AI Center of Excellence in the university city, featuring an Arm-based supercomputer, which will serve as a hub of collaboration for researchers, scientists and startups across the UK.  The separate Cambridge-1 supercomputer will be made available to researchers from industry and academia.  \u201cThe Cambridge-1 supercomputer will serve as a hub of innovation for the UK, and further the groundbreaking work being done by the nation\u2019s researchers in critical healthcare and drug discovery,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, in his GPU Technology Conference keynote speech.","97":"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, speaks at the 2018 Nvidia GPU conference in San Jose, California, U.S. March 27, 2018.

Arm provides computing chip designs to the entire global semiconductor industry, licensing out technology that powers everything from smart phones to smart toasters. Nvidia\u2019s move to buy it from Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp would put Arm, a neutral industry player, in the hands of a single chip company for the first time.  Within hours of its announcement this week, the deal sparked worries in the chip industry that Nvidia would raise prices or otherwise make it harder for Nvidia\u2019s rivals to use Arm technology, despite a promise from both firms that Nvidia would keep Arm\u2019s neutral model.  The move also renewed interest in RISC-V, an open-source basic chip technology not controlled by any one industry player. California startup SiFive is where several of the creators of RISC-V now work, selling designs based on RISC-V that are tested and ready to turn into silicon.  SiFive on Thursday named Patrick Little, a former Qualcomm executive who had overseen that company\u2019s automotive division, as its new chief executive.  Little told Reuters in an interview that SiFive customers that had previously used its technology for minor aspects of their chips have contacted him in his first 48 hours on the job asking to work more closely on major designs.  \u201cThey\u2019re saying, now we have to do something more strategic,\u201d Little said. \u201cAlready, six of the top ten semiconductor companies are working with SiFive.

For a few months Australia was the envy of the virus-hit world. But the airline industry\u2019s recent struggles Down Under illustrate how Canberra has now taken a bumpier route. Competition officials are looking into Qatar Airways and others for prioritising business travellers over economy class. It\u2019s a side effect of the country\u2019s draconian policies on the movement of people.  Super-strict limits on arrivals are at the root of the problem: Sydney airport, for example, is allowed 350 passenger arrivals per day, making it desperately difficult for citizens to return. For carriers, however, the wrong mix of fare-payers can make flights even more commercially unviable. Qantas Airways, Australia\u2019s national carrier, has scrapped most of its international flights. That makes the Gulf network airlines\u2019 capacity more important.

Rating agency S&P Global said on Wednesday that it expects the European corporate default rate to hit 8.5% by June 2021, up from just over 3% now, as companies struggle with a sluggish recovery and debt from the pandemic. In a pessimistic scenario, which includes a longer recession and a second wave of Covid-19, defaults could reach 11.5%.  Bond traders don\u2019t seem fussed. The return investors demand to hold risky debt has fallen in recent months, as central banks pumped liquidity into banks and markets. The spread on the Markit iTraxx Crossover index of junk-rated credit default swaps has halved since March to around 340 basis points. That\u2019s enough to cover losses if defaults hit around 5%, according to Breakingviews estimates. Investors may be betting on a vaccine and a speedy recovery, or may be just desperate for yield.

But Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said that \u201cindustry-wide capacity constraints\u201d meant it could be months before supplies of Nvidia\u2019s newest line of gaming chips could catch up with demand.  Besides high-end gaming devices, Nvidia\u2019s graphics chips are used in data centers to speed up computing for artificial intelligence work such as image recognition, which helped it eclipse rival Intel Corp\u2019s market capitalization earlier this year.  Revenue from the data center segment more than doubled to $1.9 billion, compared with FactSet estimates of $1.84 billion.  Nvidia shares dropped after Kress told investors on a conference call that data center revenue would decline in the fourth quarter.  The company said revenue from Mellanox, the Israeli networking chip firm it acquired last year, contributed \u201capproximately a third\u201d of data center segment revenue in the third quarter, but that some of the growth came from sales to an unnamed Chinese customer that would not repeat in the fourth quarter.  In September, U.S. officials put into effect new restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] that blocked it from buying chips from U.S. companies indefinitely, prompting the Chinese firm to stockpile chips.

At a Gamescom 2018 press conference in Cologne, Germany, Nvidia rolled out its newest generation of gaming chips - the RTX 2070, RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Ti. They are based on its recently launched chip blueprint called \u201cTuring,\u201d which Nvidia is also using for higher-priced chips announced last week for game designers, movie makers and other computer graphics professionals.  The chips will range from $499 to $999 and will be available in retail stores starting Sept. 20, Chief Executive Jensen Huang said at the event.  The biggest selling point of the gaming chips released on Monday is an improvement in so-called \u201creal-time ray tracing,\u201d or the ability for the chip to simulate how light rays will bounce around in a visual scene, which helps video games and other computer graphics more closely resemble shadows and reflections in the real world.  Part of how the new chip achieves high resolution graphics quickly is a special section of the chip that finishes most of the image but then uses artificial intelligence to guess what the unfinished pixels should look like. That task was difficult to do well in the past, Huang said in his presentation.  \u201cWe\u2019re using artificial intelligence to generate resolution that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWe can now for the very first time generate missing pixels that are actually right.\u201d  Gaming produced $5.5 billion of Nvidia\u2019s $9.7 billion in revenue for its most recent fiscal year, up 36 percent from the year before.

REUTERS\/Sergio Perez  At an event in San Francisco, Qualcomm said it plans to begin testing its new Cloud AI 100 chip with partners such as Microsoft Corp later this year, with mass production likely to begin in 2020.  Qualcomm\u2019s new chip is designed for what artificial intelligence researchers call \u201cinference\u201d - the process of using an AI algorithm that has been \u201ctrained\u201d with massive amounts of data in order to, for example, translate audio into text-based requests.  Analysts believe chips for speeding up inference will be the largest part of the AI chip market.  Nvidia has released special chips for the task and Intel is working with Facebook Inc on one that will be released later this year. Cloud computing vendors such as Amazon.com\u2019s Amazon Web Services and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Cloud unit are also making their own inference chips.  All that activity means Qualcomm is entering a crowded field behind its rivals.  But Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm\u2019s president and the chief of its chip division, said the San Diego company is taking a different approach by aiming to serve the smaller, simpler data centers that are proliferating around the world so that consumers can benefit from faster response times for their internet-connected apps.  In order to serve those smaller \u201cedge\u201d data sites, Qualcomm is focusing on AI chips that consume small amounts of electricity and generate little heat - a specialty it developed when making chips for mobile phones, which run on small batteries and live in pockets.

Treasury yields are expected to rise further ahead of Monday\u2019s auctions. The U.S. government will sell $81 billion in short-dated bills, $40 billion of two-year notes and $41 billion of five-year notes. An additional $78 billion will be sold on Tuesday.  Bond issuance has increased steadily since 2018 to fund President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts and spending increases. The latest flood of supply coincides with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaling that the central bank may pause its gradual increases in interest rates after U.S. economic data came in softer-than-expected in December and volatile financial markets whipped investors around.  Not all market participants were concerned that the increased supply, alongside expectations of a Fed pause, would decrease demand. Bond yields increase with interest rates, with the two-year yield used as a proxy for market sentiment about interest rate hikes.  \u201cToday\u2019s two-year supply will offer an update on primary market demand for Treasuries as Powell\u2019s pause gets underway,\u201d said Benjamin Jeffrey, trading products analyst at BMO Capital Markets. \u201cWhile on an outright basis two-year yields are well off their cycle highs set late last year, within the context of this new, lower range, two-years look cheaper than they have for most of 2019.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 302 points, or 1.22 percent and the S&P 500 Index fell 1.02 percent, down 27.2 points in mid-morning trade.

REUTERS\/ Mike Blake  (Reuters) - Semiconductor firm Nvidia Corp on Thursday announced a new chip that can be digitally split up to run several different programs on one physical chip, a first for the company that matches a key capability on many of Intel Corp\u2019s chips.  The notion behind what the Santa Clara, California-based company calls its A100 chip is simple: Help the owners of data centers get every bit of computing power possible out of the physical chips they purchase by ensuring the chip never sits idle. The same principle helped power the rise of cloud computing over the past two decades and helped Intel build a massive data center business.  When software developers turn to a cloud computing provider such as Amazon.com or Microsoft Corp for computing power, they do not rent a full physical server inside a data center. Instead they rent a software-based slice of a physical server called a \u201cvirtual machine.\u201d  Such virtualization technology came about because software developers realized that powerful and pricey servers often ran far below full computing capacity. By slicing physical machines into smaller virtual ones, developers could cram more software on to them, similar to the puzzle game Tetris. Amazon, Microsoft and others built profitable cloud businesses out of wringing every bit of computing power from their hardware and selling that power to millions of customers.  But the technology has been mostly limited to processor chips from Intel and similar chips such as those from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Nvidia said Thursday that its new A100 chip can be split into seven \u201cinstances.\u201d  For Nvida, that solves a practical problem. Nvidia sells chips for artificial intelligence tasks. The market for those chips breaks into two parts. \u201cTraining\u201d requires a powerful chip to, for example, analyze millions of images to train an algorithm to recognize faces. But once the algorithm is trained, \u201cinference\u201d tasks need only a fraction of the computing power to scan a single image and spot a face.  Nvidia is hoping the A100 can replace both, being used as a big single chip for training and split into smaller inference chips.  Customers who want to test the theory will pay a steep price of $200,000 for Nvidia\u2019s DGX server built around the A100 chips. In a call with reporters, Chief Executive Jensen Huang argued the math will work in Nvidia\u2019s favor, saying the computing power in the DGX A100 was equal to that of 75 traditional servers that would cost $5,000 each.  \u201cBecause it\u2019s fungible, you don\u2019t have to buy all these different types of servers. Utilization will be higher,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got 75 times the performance of a $5,000 server, and you don\u2019t have to buy all the cables.\u201d","121":"NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia Corp is nearing a deal to acquire peer Mellanox Technologies Ltd for more than $7 billion in cash, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday.

Nvidia, the biggest U.S. chip company by market capitalisation, has agreed to buy Arm from Japan\u2019s SoftBank, prompting the office of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say it would scrutinise the deal and act if necessary.  Arm is the most important technology company in Britain, and one of a handful of European tech groups that operate on a global scale. Its energy-efficient designs dominate the smartphone sector, with its licensees including Apple shipping 180 billion chips to date.  It was sold in 2016 to Japan\u2019s SoftBank after the conglomerate pledged to retain Arm\u2019s headquarters in Cambridge, England, and increase jobs - a commitment that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reiterated on Monday.  \u201cWe want to grow Arm and make it become even greater,\u201d Huang told analysts on a call, adding Arm would hire more engineers, spend more on research, and run a new artificial intelligence research centre in Cambridge.  \u201cThe UK government will realise that we are making a very significant investment in the UK,\u201d added Huang. He stopped short, however, of making formal job guarantees and said talks with the UK government had yet to begin in earnest.  A spokesman for Johnson said ministers had spoken to the relevant companies and were looking at what the deal meant for Arm\u2019s Cambridge base.  U.S. SELLOUT?  The deal, announced overnight, drew criticism from Hermann Hauser, a co-founder of Arm who told Reuters in an interview that it would spell disaster for Cambridge, the UK and Europe.  \u201cIt\u2019s the last European technology company with global relevance and it\u2019s being sold to the Americans,\u201d he said.  The deal would, he fears, risk jeopardising Arm\u2019s position as the \u201cSwitzerland of the semiconductor industry\u201d where it allows hundreds of companies such as Apple, Samsung and Qualcomm to develop their own chips using its architecture.  If the company\u2019s British character and open business model could not be protected, it would be better for Johnson to back a flotation on the London Stock Exchange, Hauser said.  COMMITMENTS  Industry and potential anti-trust concerns over the deal relate to the fact that Nvidia competes with hundreds of Arm\u2019s customers, whereas tech investor SoftBank does not.  Nvidia\u2019s Huang said he would retain Arm\u2019s neutral licensing model and expand it by licensing out Nvidia intellectual property for the first time.  The head of Arm, Simon Segar, said a purchase by an American company would not affect which countries it sold to.

FILE PHOTO - The nVIDIA booth is shown at the E3 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2017. REUTERS\/ Mike Blake  The forecast reinforced expectations of a rebound in chip demand and sent Nvidia shares up nearly 7% in extended trading. Last month, Intel Corp INTC.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O, Nvidia's primary rivals in selling chips to data center customers, both forecast positive trends in that market.  Nvidia is the second chipmaker after Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O to warn about a potential impact on its businesses due to the coronavirus outbreak.  Nvidia\u2019s largest market is chips that enhance the graphics in video games played on PCs and laptops. But in recent years, the company has expanded to sell to data center and cloud computing customers as its chips increasingly power artificial intelligence tasks such as facial recognition and speech recognition.  Revenue from Nvidia\u2019s closely watched data center chips business rose 42.6% to $968 million in its fiscal fourth quarter, beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $829 million, according to research firm FactSet.  Nvidia did not name big customers but said that \"hyperscale\" customers drove the increased data center sales, a group that industry analysts often define as major cloud computing vendors such as Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, Amazon.com's AMZN.O cloud unit and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O.  Artificial intelligence chips for data centers come in two broad types: \u201ctraining\u201d chips that ingest data and train a software to carry out tasks like recognizing a face, and \u201cinference\u201d chips that use the trained algorithms to carry out the task. Nvidia dominates the market for training chips, while Intel had most of the inference market.  But Nvidia executives said the company\u2019s inference revenue grew by a factor of four over the past year, thanks to a new chip. Chief Executive Jensen Huang told Reuters in an interview that inference chips reached a \u201clow double-digits\u201d percentage of Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter, but training chips also set sales record.  \u201cI would expect inference to grow, and I would expect training to grow,\u201d Huang said.  The Santa Clara, California-based company said it expects current-quarter revenue of $3 billion, plus or minus 2%, the midpoint of which is above analysts\u2019 expectation of $2.86 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China, a major market for both its gaming and data center chips, was unclear but it has reduced its sales outlook by $100 million in response. In a conference call with investors, Colette Kress, Nvidia\u2019s chief financial officer, said China represented about 30% of sales for Nvidia\u2019s gaming chip business, the company\u2019s largest sales segment.  \u201cWe had expected a weaker outlook for its April quarter as Nvidia does have a very high gaming GPU sales exposure in China,\u201d said Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group. \u201cWe believe the continued strength in Nvidia\u2019s data center business is able to partially offset the demand weakness in its consumer gaming business in China due to the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d  Nvidia said it expects its $6.8 billion acquisition of Israeli chip firm Mellanox Technologies Ltd MLNX.O will close in the \"early part of calendar 2020.\" Nvidia still needs approval from Chinese regulators.  Revenue from its gaming business, still the biggest contributor to sales, rose 56% to $1.49 billion in the fourth quarter, but fell short of analysts\u2019 estimate of $1.52 billion, according to FactSet.  Total revenue in the quarter rose about 41% to $3.11 billion, above analysts\u2019 estimate of $2.97 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Net income rose to $950 million, or $1.53 per share, in the fiscal fourth-quarter ended Jan. 26, from $567 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier.

Demand for graphic chips from Bitcoin miners brought in hundreds of millions of dollars for Nvidia in 2018. But at the fag end of the year the boom evaporated, and, coupled with lower demand from China, led to a pile-up of unsold chips at distributors and retailers.  Nvidia will not be able to make up on all the crypto loss and could likely miss the full-year guidance, according to analyst Kinngai Chan from Summit Insights Group.

Arm\u2019s licensing operation would fit poorly with Apple\u2019s hardware and software focused business model and there may also be regulatory concerns about Apple owning a key licensee that supplies so many rivals, according to the report. Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment.  SoftBank last month unveiled a series of transactions to divest more than $21 billion worth of stock in U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc, as it seeks funding for a $41 billion share buyback and debt reduction plan.","148":"Jan 8 (Reuters) - Intel Corp plans to tap Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to make a second generation discrete graphics chip for personal computers that it hopes will help it combat the rise of Nvidia Corp, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The chip, known as \u201cDG2\u201d, will be made on a new chipmaking process at TSMC that has not yet been formally named but is an enhanced version of its 7-nanometer process, the two people familiar the matter said.  Intel, long the world leader in chip-making technology, has lost its manufacturing edge in recent years and is now debating whether to outsource some of it flagship central processor unit chips, or CPUs, slated for release in 2023.  Activist investor Third Point LLC last month sent Intel\u2019s board a letter asking it to consider whether to keep its chip design and manufacturing operations under one roof.  Intel has long outsourced chips other than its flagship CPUs and is a major customer of TSMC, the world\u2019s leading contract chip manufacturer. The head of Intel\u2019s self-driving subsidiary Mobileye last month told Reuters that its next autonomous vehicle processor will be continue to be manufactured by TSMC on its 7-nanometer process.  With its graphics chips, Intel is looking to tap into the booming PC gaming market. Its DG2 chip is expected to be released late this year or in early 2022 and compete with Nvidia and AMD gaming chips that cost between $400 and $600, the sources said.  The chip manufacturing technology for the DG2 is expected to be more advanced than the Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 8-nanometer process used in Nvidia\u2019s most recent round of graphics chips released in the fall, the people said. They added it would also have a leg up on the Advanced Micro Devices graphics chips made on TSMC\u2019s 7-nanometer process.  Intel declined to comment and TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Intel officials last year said that it would outsource the DG2 chip but did not say which chip manufacturer had won the business or which chipmaking process it would use.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Nvidia was long known as a supplier of graphics chips for personal computers to make video games look more realistic, but researchers now also use its chips inside data centers to speed up artificial intelligence computing work such as training computers to recognize images.  To do so, Nvidia\u2019s so-called accelerator chips work alongside central processors from companies such as Intel Corp and International Business Machines Corp.  At a supercomputing conference held in Germany on Monday, Nvidia said its accelerator chips will work with Arm processors by the end of the year.  Arm, owned by Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp, provides the underlying processor technology for the chips in most mobile phones. But companies such as Ampere Computing, headed by Intel\u2019s former president, have been working to take those chips into data centers, where Intel\u2019s chips are dominant.  But Arm processors are different from Intel or IBM chips in that Arm itself does not make chips. Instead it licenses out the underlying technology so others can make chips with it.  Ian Buck, vice president of Nvidia\u2019s accelerated computing unit, said the project to build a supercomputer with Arm will be a \u201cheavy lift\u201d from a technical perspective.  But he said Nvidia undertook it because researchers in Europe and Japan want to develop super computing chips with Arm\u2019s technology, essentially giving them a third option beyond IBM and Intel over which they can have more control.  \u201cThat openness ... makes it very attractive,\u201d Buck said of Arm\u2019s technology during an interview with Reuters before the conference. \u201cWhat makes Arm interesting, and why we\u2019re announcing support is, is its ability to provide an open architecture for supercomputing.\u201d  The move to work with Arm on supercomputers follows Nvidia\u2019s $6.8 billion deal to buy Israeli firm Mellanox Technologies.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Nvidia chips dominate the AI training chip market, where huge amounts of data help algorithms \u201clearn\u201d a task such how to recognize a human voice, but one of the biggest growth areas in the field will be deploying computers that implement the \u201clearned\u201d tasks. Intel dominates data centers where such tasks are likely to be carried out.  \u201cFor the next 18 to 24 months, it\u2019s very hard to envision anyone challenging Nvidia on training,\u201d said Jon Bathgate, analyst and tech sector co-lead at Janus Henderson Investors.  But Intel processors already are widely used for taking a trained artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by scanning incoming audio and translating that into text-based requests, what is called \u201cinference.\u201d  Intel\u2019s chips can still work just fine there, especially when paired with huge amounts of memory, said Bruno Fernandez-Ruiz, chief technology officer of Nexar Inc, an Israeli startup using smartphone cameras to try to prevent car collisions.  That market could be bigger than the training market, said Abhinav Davuluri, an analyst at Morningstar, who sees an inference market of $11.8 billion by 2021, versus $8.2 billion for training. Intel estimates that the current market for AI chips is about $2.5 billion, evenly split between inference and training.  Nvidia, which posted an 89 percent rise in profit Thursday, hasn\u2019t given a specific estimate for the inference chip market but CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call with analysts on Thursday that believes it \u201cis going to be a very large market for us.\u201d  Nvidia sales of inference chips are rising. In May, the company said it had doubled its shipments of them year-over-year to big data center customers, though it didn't give a baseline. Earlier this month, Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Cloud unit said it had adopted Nvidia's inference chips and would rent them out to customers.  But Nvidia faces a headwind selling inference chips because the data center market is blanketed with the CPUs Intel has been selling for 20 years. Intel is working to persuade customers that for both technical and business reasons, they should stick with what they have.  Take Taboola, a New York-based company that helps web publishers recommend related content to readers and that Intel has touted as an example of how its chips remain competitive.  The company uses Nvidia\u2019s training chips to teach its algorithm to learn what to recommend and considered Nvidia\u2019s inference chips to make the recommendations. Speed matters because users leave slow-loading pages.  But Taboola ended up sticking with Intel for reasons of speed and cost, said Ariel Pisetzky, the company\u2019s vice president of information technology.  Nvidia\u2019s chip was far faster, but time spent shuffling data back and forth to the chip negated the gains, Pisetzky said. Second, Intel dispatched engineers to help Taboola tweak its computer code so that the same servers could handle more than twice as many requests.  \u201cMy options were, you already have the servers. They\u2019re in the racks,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking with Intel, I can now cut back my new server purchases by a factor of two because I can use my existing servers two times better.\u201d  Nvidia has been working to solve those challenges. The company has rolled out software this year to make its inference chips far faster to help overcome the issue of moving data back and forth. And it announced a new family of chips based on a technology called Turing earlier this week that it says will be 10 times faster still, Huang said on the analyst call Thursday.  \u201cWe are actively working with just about every single Internet service provider in the world to incorporate inference acceleration into their stack,\u201d Huang said. He gave the example that \u201cvoice recognition is only useful if it responds in a relatively short period of time.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  With new software it calls RAPIDS, Nvidia is hoping to move beyond the fast-growing but relatively small market for artificial intelligence chips. It\u2019s aiming for the much larger market for chips that do basic business data crunching such as forecasting inventories. Nvidia announced the software at a conference in Germany.  Nvidia got its start in the 1990s with graphics processors to make video games look more realistic. But in recent years its chips have become used as so-called \u201caccelerators\u201d in data centers to speed up artificial intelligence work, like training computers to recognize images or human speech.  Nvidia\u2019s processors are not direct replacements for Intel\u2019s general purpose computing chips. But when businesses use a lot of Nvidia\u2019s chips, they often buy Intel\u2019s chips at a slower rate.  Nvidia\u2019s strong position in the artificial intelligence field came from its software efforts rather than its chips alone. About a decade ago, Nvidia created a platform that would let developers program its chips for a wide range of tasks rather than just video game graphics. Artificial intelligence researchers embraced it.  But for all the buzz artificial intelligence generates, other types of computing - like perfecting analytical models for more accurate inventory forecasts - are more common in businesses. Nvidia\u2019s new software aims to speed up that kind of work.  Nvidia has teamed up with a range of companies, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Oracle Corp and a branch of International Business Machines, to release the new tools. They are being used by Walmart Inc, Nvidia said.  \u201cIt\u2019s really an ecosystem we\u2019re trying to build out,\u201d Jeff Tseng, head of product for artificial intelligence infrastructure at Nvidia, told Reuters in an interview.

Nvidia has displaced Intel Corp INTC.O as the biggest U.S. chip company by market capitalization on the strength of its data center chips for artificial intelligence. It has said it will keep Arm's business model of openly licensing the company's technology throughout the chip industry.  But because chips take years to go from an idea to silicon, Arm\u2019s customers often disclose information about future plans during licensing discussions with Arm. Arm customers also share sales forecasts and figures to calculate royalty payments.  \u201cWe are going to keep the firewalls up between the two companies relative to confidentiality, and we\u2019re not going to give any early access to Nvidia,\u201d Rene Haas, president of Arm\u2019s IP Products Group, told Reuters in an interview.  But Haas said some information would still need to be conveyed to Nvidia, such as if major customers disclosed plans to move to RISC-V, an open source competitor to Arm, setting the stage for a downturn in sales that might in turn affect Nvidia\u2019s financial results.
