Jason Ramshaw, Commercial Manager for Caterpillar Construction Digital & Technology, demonstrates the Cat Command remote control console to operate a 320 excavator at Caterpillar's Construction Industries EAME Sales Rally in Malaga, Spain, in an undated handout photograph. Caterpillar\/Handout via REUTERS  Answer: Cut out human operators, perhaps?  Caterpillar\u2019s autonomous driving technology, which can be bolted on to existing machines, is helping the U.S. heavy equipment maker mitigate the heavy impact of the coronavirus crisis on sales of its traditional workhorses.  With both small and large customers looking to protect their operations from future disruptions, demand has surged for machines that don\u2019t require human operators on board.  Sales of Caterpillar\u2019s autonomous technology for mining operations have been growing at a double-digit percentage clip this year compared with 2019, according to previously unreported internal company data shared with Reuters.  By contrast, sales of its yellow bulldozers, mining trucks and other equipment have been falling for the past nine months, a trend that's also hit its main rivals including Japan's Komatsu Ltd 6301.T and American player Deere & Co DE.N.  Fred Rio, worldwide product manager at Caterpillar\u2019s construction digital & technology division, told Reuters that a remote-control technology, which allows users to operate machines from several miles away, would be available for construction sites in January.  The company is also working with space agencies to use satellite technology to allow an operator sitting in the United States to remotely communicate with machines on job sites in, say, Africa or elsewhere in the world, he said.  Caterpillar\u2019s automation strategy was not born during the COVID-19 era, though. The company stepped up investments in such technologies as it emerged in 2017 from the longest downturn in its history, as part of a plan to increase recurring revenue from lucrative sales of services.  But it\u2019s early days, and such tech remains a niche part of Caterpillar\u2019s operations. Though it does not break out the revenue from technology sales, the rising demand is unlikely to make a major impact anytime soon on the group\u2019s revenue, which stood at about $54 billion last year.  It is also a costly endeavor with the company pumping billions into R&D as a whole. Yet it is not clear if demand for autonomous and remote tech will hold up in a post-pandemic world while, in the longer term, there is the risk that a technology-driven improvement in productivity could drive down sales of new equipment.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u2018IT HAS GOT CRAZIER\u2019  Nonetheless, autonomous technology is helping Caterpillar win equipment deals from customers that were previously not buying a lot of its machines.  Last year, Rio Tinto RIO.L signed up the company to supply self-driving trucks, autonomous blast drills, loaders and other machines for the construction of the Koodaideri iron ore mine in Australia, which is expected to be operational next year.  Rio Tinto declined to comment on the equipment deal.  The mining industry has already adopted some technologies for self-driving trucks and remote operation of load-haul-dump machines. However the suspension in activities worldwide following government-mandated lockdowns at the peak of COVID-19, as well as recent outbreaks of infections at coal mines in Poland, have accelerated the deployment of those technologies.  Anthony Cook, general manager for autonomous haulage systems at Caterpillar\u2019s rival Komatsu, said a lot of customers had brought forward their spending plans following the pandemic in a bid to take drivers out of mining trucks.  He said the COVID-19 crisis had not hit the fortunes of his autonomous business: \u201cIf anything, it has got crazier.\u201d  CATERPILLAR\u2019S IN SPACE  Caterpillar and Komatsu hold the lion\u2019s share of the global autonomous haulage system market worldwide.  But Illinois-based Caterpillar has a competitive advantage, according to some analysts, as its technology can be retrofitted onto competitors\u2019 equipment, making it a better fit for mixed fleets. Komatsu\u2019s technology currently only works with its own machines.  Komatsu\u2019s Cook said that while retrofitting offered a short-term solution, his company was developing technology to allow different brands of equipment to operate together \u201csafely and efficiently\u201d, which he added would offer long-term benefits.  But Jim Hawkins, general manager at Caterpillar\u2019s resource industries division, said the ability to retrofit had helped drive up sales, because mining companies can buy the hardware and software to make machines operate autonomously without paying the much larger cost of overhauling their whole fleet.  That is a selling point at a time when miners are grappling with the virus-induced business uncertainty.  Caterpillar sells autonomous operation technology separately from its machines. While retrofitting existing fleets has been the biggest driver for growth until now, Hawkins says an increasing number of customers are now ordering autonomous-ready mining trucks.  The company charges mining customers a hardware fee, a software fee and recurring licensing fee. In all, the technology could cost from $50 million to hundreds of millions of dollars, depending upon the size of the fleet and the duration of the contract, Hawkins said.  All these applications are part of the company\u2019s endeavor to increases services revenue, which tends to be more resilient and profitable than equipment sales. It aims to increase services sales to $28 billion by 2026 from $18 billion in 2019.  Rob Wertheimer, machinery analyst at Melius Research, said the need for mining companies to replace an aging mining fleet and their growing demand for autonomous upgrades should help Caterpillar, with its tech giving it a \u201cdifferential\u201d advantage over rivals.  \u201cStrategically, they are in a better place,\u201d he added.","3":"Oct 5 (Reuters) - Engineering company Weir Group Plc said on Monday it had agreed to sell its oil and gas division to U.S. heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc for $405 million in cash.

Caterpillar will supply a fleet of 20 autonomous 793F trucks as well as four autonomous blast drills for the mine, which Rio is developing for $2.6 billion with first production expected to start by the end of 2021.  The mine is expected to underpin Rio\u2019s production of its flagship Pilbara Blend iron ore, sustaining its current output of more than 330 million tonnes a year which it draws from 16 mines in the region.  \u201cBeyond the autonomous fleet, Caterpillar will also provide loaders, dozers, graders, water carts and diggers for the operation which will be Rio Tinto\u2019s first Pilbara mine to be primarily operated using Caterpillar machinery,\u201d Rio said.  Caterpillar\u2019s machinery will be integrated into what Rio calls its first intelligent mine, to improve productivity across Rio Tinto\u2019s entire iron ore network, it said.

Bonfield\u2019s appointment comes at a time when Caterpillar is fighting an IRS demand that it pay $2 billion in taxes and penalties for shifting profit to its Swiss unit to lessen its U.S. tax bill.  Bonfield, 54, has been National Grid\u2019s CFO for more than eight years, during which he oversaw the company\u2019s $7 billion stake sale in its gas grid in 2016, which was then reported as one of the biggest British infrastructure deals in recent times.

Halverson, who retires on Friday, served as CFO since 2013.  Joe Creed will be the interim finance chief until Bonfield take over, Caterpillar said.","13":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc CAT.N on Monday gave a promising outlook for the global economy despite ongoing trade tensions and mounting cost concerns, and the heavy equipment maker lifted its full-year earnings forecast after quarterly profits nearly doubled.  The Deerfield, Illinois-based company now expects adjusted profit per share to be in a range of $11 to $12 in 2018, compared with $10.25 to $11.25 projected earlier.  The second increase to the profit outlook in the past two quarters helped somewhat allay investors\u2019 concerns that the industrial cycle and even broader economic activity are approaching their peak.  \u201cThere is continuing improvement in many of our end markets,\u201d Jim Umpleby told analysts on a conference call. \u201cOur order rates in the backlog remain strong.\u201d  Caterpillar said it has not yet seen the impact of ongoing trade tensions on its business, but said tariffs are estimated to inflate material costs in the second half of 2018 by up to $200 million.  Overseas markets account for half of Caterpillar\u2019s sales. Caterpillar is better placed than many companies to deal with the tariffs as its manufacturing footprint is spread across the globe.  Yet, the stock has lost about 18 percent since January, buffeted by increasing trade frictions and mounting costs. The stock last month fell to its lowest level since late October before recovering modestly. It was last trading up 0.4 percent at $143.20.  Higher freight prices, which drove up manufacturing costs in the last quarter, are expected to remain elevated.  The company expects to take higher costs in its stride through price increases it carried out on July 1 and through cost discipline.  FILE PHOTO: A Caterpillar corporate logo is pictured in front of a building in Peoria, Illinois, U.S., March 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri\/File Photo  Analysts at JP Morgan reiterated their \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on the stock, saying potential earnings upside is not fully priced in the company\u2019s shares.  STRONG DEMAND, PRICING POWER  Monday\u2019s results showed that a strong global economy, which is having its best run since 2011, is helping manufacturers like Caterpillar book more orders and deliver higher profits despite cost pressures.  For example, the company said demand for oil and gas and mining machines is so strong that it was taking orders for delivery well into 2019. At the end of the second quarter, its order backlog was $17.7 billion, up about $200 million from the first quarter.  It saw positive pricing in all of its principal business segments except construction industries.  Overall, the company expects product prices to more than offset increased costs in the second half of the year.  This is in contrast to companies such as Ford Motor Co F.N and Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N, which are battling weak demand and do not enjoy the same pricing power to offset increased input costs.  In resource industries, higher commodity prices and strong global growth have helped improve the finances of mining customers. However, the company said customers have yet to start full-scale fleet replacements.  In Caterpillar\u2019s energy & transportation division, robust oil prices are supporting demand for well-servicing and gas compression applications in North America.  In the Asia-Pacific region, which accounted for nearly a quarter of company revenues, equipment sales were up 39 percent from a year ago, helped by infrastructure investment in China.  Caterpillar reported an adjusted profit of $2.97 a share in the second quarter, compared with $1.49 a share last year. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.73 a share.  The company repurchased $750 million of shares in the second quarter and announced an up to $10-billion buyback authorization from January 2019.","14":"Jan 28 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc forecast full-year profit below analysts\u2019 estimates on Monday, indicating a slide in global demand stemming from China would worsen after it reported revenue in line with expectations for the last three months of 2018.

Since the heavy equipment maker is considered a bellwether for global economic activity, signals such as an earnings guidance or resumption of share repurchases should reassure Wall Street about underlying business conditions.

The Deerfield, Illinois-based company has not yet provided new earnings guidance after it withdrew the 2020 outlook in late March citing uncertainty about the pandemic. To preserve cash, share repurchases have been suspended.  A recovery in machine retail sales in Asia and slowing sales declines in other regions have raised hopes that the worst is over for the construction and mining equipment maker.  Easing coronavirus restrictions in the United States should also aid the sales recovery.

Stockholm-based Swedwatch, which focuses on business activities in developing countries, said the three firms still dominate the machinery market in Hpakant, a mining township in the restive Kachin state that supplies 90% of the world\u2019s jade.  Myanmar\u2019s poorly regulated jade mines help finance a long-running conflict between the army and armed ethnic groups, and the report said the industry contributed to land degradation, water pollution and landslides that kill hundreds of people each year.  \u201cThe global mining machinery companies\u2019 seemingly blatant lack of safeguards in response to this context is a matter of serious urgency,\u201d Swedwatch said in a report.  It said U.S. machine maker Caterpillar and Japan\u2019s Komatsu \u201cstill have not attempted to identify the negative human rights impacts related to their products in Myanmar\u201d.  Volvo did engage human rights consultants to conduct due diligence following an initial report by the charity in 2018. The Swedish company said the probe had absolved it of any responsibility.  \u201cAs a machinery provider, we do not believe we are responsible for human rights violations ... where our products are not directly responsible for the harm caused,\u201d spokeswoman Anna Abenius told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  \u201cThis was confirmed in our work with the human rights expert organisation.\u201d  A Caterpillar spokeswoman declined to comment on the situation in Myanmar and referred to a statement on the company\u2019s website about its commitment to international standards on human rights.  Komatsu did not respond to requests for comment.  When asked about the charity\u2019s warnings two years ago, Komatsu said it would not sell to companies found responsible for \u201cadverse human rights impacts,\u201d and that it had not received such reports from Myanmar.  Myanmar\u2019s jade production was worth some $31 billion in 2014, according to human rights charity Global Witness.  Myanmar\u2019s military - known as the Tatmadaw and widely accused of human rights abuses in Kachin state and elsewhere - dominates the industry, the United Nations said following a series of fact-finding missions last year.  It said the Tatmadaw\u2019s involvement in jade and ruby mining \u201cbenefited from and directly contributed to international human rights violations in conflict-affected areas in Kachin state\u201d, warning of the ethical implications of doing business there.  Author of the Swedwatch report Therese Sjostrom Jaekel said Illinois-headquartered company Caterpillar - the world\u2019s biggest construction and mining equipment maker - was in a unique position to take action.  \u201cIf Caterpillar took the time to listen to the testimonies, to analyse what we\u2019ve found, then it could transform the entire sector and change the lives of thousands of families,\u201d she said.","29":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc CAT.N on Friday predicted no improvement in equipment sales, an outlook that sent its shares down after second-quarter earnings sank during a crippling recession sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, which made customers wary of big purchases.

Caterpillar had said in April during an post-earnings call that it expects full-year sales in China to remain flat.  Worldwide retail sales for construction machines rose 2% and that for resources gained 21% for the rolling three-month period ended May.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Wall Street will also watch out for the company\u2019s commentary on order backlog to assess the strength of global demand amid escalating trade tensions.  Analysts polled by Reuters, on average, expect the company\u2019s adjusted net profit to rise to $2.73 per share in the second quarter, from $1.49 per share a year ago. Net profit for the quarter is estimated to rise to $2.58 per share from $1.35 last year.  Deerfield, Illinois-based Caterpillar, which serves as a bellwether for global economic activity, has benefited from a humming global economy which is having its best run since 2011. After battling the longest downturn in its history, the company expects full-year 2018 profit to be the best ever.  Yet the stock has lost about 18 percent since January amid increasing trade frictions and mounting pressure on costs. The stock last month fell to its lowest level since late October before recovering modestly.  \u201cThe market has become very focused on the risk that the industrial cycle is starting to get weaker and even the broader economic cycle,\u201d Stephen Volkmann, an analyst with Jefferies, said on Wednesday. \u201cThat seems to be the primary concern.\u201d  The International Monetary Fund warned this month that worsening trade skirmishes could derail global economic recovery and depress medium-term growth prospects.  To be sure, Caterpillar is better placed than many companies to deal with the tariffs as its manufacturing footprint is spread across the globe. It also enjoys superior pricing power thanks to a robust global demand.  But the company said in April that its outstanding first-quarter performance was the \u201chigh-water mark\u201d for the year as it would not have the same pricing power to pass on increased material costs.  To offset rising costs, it implemented price hikes on July 1. Still, analysts surveyed by Reuters expect cost of production to be higher than it was in the previous quarter.  President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have raised domestic prices, denting earnings of many manufacturers.  General Motors Co GM.N on Wednesday cut its full-year profit forecast on higher metals costs, which also dented the earnings of Whirlpool Corp WHR.N.  However, some companies like Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N have found a way to soften the blow on their profit margins.","33":"* Dow futures up 0.11 pct after Caterpillar results  * S&P futures dip 0.07 pct, Nasdaq futures off 0.3 pct  July 30 (Reuters) - Dow futures got a slight boost on Monday after an encouraging report from Caterpillar, a bellwether for global economic activity, while S&P and Nasdaq futures remained under pressure from technology stocks.

(Reuters) - Six months into the U.S. tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, Caterpillar Inc CAT.N is finding that one of the best ways it can protect profits is a cost cutting strategy that is more than two years old.  At this sprawling factory in central North Carolina where it makes small front-end loaders, the company laid off workers in 2016 in response to plunging sales, consolidating two shifts into one under a program it calls the Operation & Execution Model.  Even though demand has picked up since then, its Clayton plant still runs a single shift and operates only four days a week. One third of the facility\u2019s 550 employees are on flexible contracts.  The result: CAT is producing more loaders here with 30 percent fewer people on the factory floor than in the past, the company told Reuters.  It has redesigned all new machines it makes with over 20 percent fewer parts, cutting back on the consumption of steel which brings down the cost, Tony Fassino, vice president at Caterpillar\u2019s building construction products, said after a factory tour in Clayton.  \u201cFewer parts numbers are a huge win,\u201d Fassino told Reuters. \u201cIt improves safety, it improves the quality, it improves the cost.\u201d  Now, these cost cutting approaches are helping counter the financial impact of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars.  The heavy-duty equipment maker estimates the import tariffs will inflate its raw materials costs by up to $200 million between July and December, though it does not provide a forecast for manufacturing costs in 2018. Caterpillar has said it would offset the impact through a price increase that went into effect on July 1 and general cost cutting measures, helping it post a record profit for all of 2018.  Caterpillar\u2019s increasing emphasis on operating efficiency has proven timely, helping to bring down the cost of production at a time when material expenses are mounting on Trump\u2019s import curbs, and capacity constraints are driving up freight costs.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  (For graphic click tmsnrt.rs\/2NG2DrF)  An internal calculation provided to Reuters, previously unreported, shows that the measures have accounted for half of the improvements in the profit margins since 2015 at the company\u2019s construction industries division. Since January 2017, the efficiency model has been rolled out across the company, but CAT would not disclose more details.  CAT, Deere & Co DE.N and Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N are among the many manufacturers trying to keep a lid on expenses to cope with a 30 percent rise in U.S. steel prices since the start of 2018.  Those rising costs, along with a tit-for-tat tariff war with China, have clouded the earnings outlook for industrial companies, dragging down their shares.  Despite a recent rally this month, Caterpillar shares are down about 9 percent from their late-January levels, compared with a 0.4 percent decline in S&P 500 industrials index .SPLRCI, showing investors have yet to fully reward the company for its industry-best efficiency results when it comes to operating margins and return on net operating assets.  (For graphic click tmsnrt.rs\/2CN5P0g)  Steve Volkmann, a machinery analyst at Jefferies, attributes the stock\u2019s underperformance to concerns that the company\u2019s greater exposure to foreign markets and a sizeable presence in China make it more vulnerable to escalating trade wars.  \u201cIt is disappointing that they can\u2019t get paid for good quarters these days,\u201d he said, referring to the company\u2019s strong earnings in the last quarter.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  While overseas markets do account for more than half of Caterpillar\u2019s sales, the company has an evenly spread manufacturing footprint across the globe, which Volkmann and other analysts say make it better placed to deal with the tariffs.  The company has also tried to put at rest worries about its operations in China, saying the trade tensions have not impacted its business there.  COST CONTROL  As part of its cost cutting effort, CAT business heads have been mandated to reduce the overall manufacturing cost of every new product by at least 5 percent, one Caterpillar company executive told Reuters. This entails cost cuts by suppliers as well.  Donaldson Company Inc DCI.N - which makes filters for CAT's machines - told Reuters that it tries lower the cost of production every year through material substitution or automation or efficiency gains. Cuts in travel and entertainment budgets helped the company improve operating income by 40 basis points in the latest quarter.  CAT\u2019s Operation and Execution effort affects both production strategy decisions and small details of every operation.  For example, it does not make smaller front-wheel loaders in the United States even though their sales in North America are growing. Instead, semi-finished machines are shipped in from overseas factories to the Clayton facility, where tires and buckets are installed, Fassino said.  This not only allows better utilization of the company\u2019s factories, but also provides flexibility to tailor the machines to the requirements of local customers.  Similarly, CAT has been managing freight contracts for deliveries across North America since 2016. Apart from improving the predictability of deliveries, and reducing insurance and damage claims, the contracts are letting Caterpillar leverage its scale and volume to moderate transportation costs in its supply chain.  OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY  At the Clayton plant, the company\u2019s focus on lean manufacturing, efficiency and flexible cost is on full display.  Parts are put in a sequential order in stand-up bag carts next to the assembly line so that assemblers do not have to spend time looking for them.  Suppliers have been instructed to pack the parts in the same way. In case the parts do not arrive in the required order, workers in the factory warehouse are required to unpack and rearrange the parts before they reach the factory floor.  Automation is increasingly being used to test machines. Components and parts are moved on tugger trains instead of by fork lifts to save time and cost.  \u201cSave one minute here and save five minutes there. Add all that up, you have two shifts to one shift,\u201d said Caterpillar\u2019s Fassino.","36":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * U.S. government reopens after 35-day shutdown  * Caterpillar falls as China slowdown hits profit, forecast  * Oil prices drop on signs of rising output  * Next round of U.S.-China trade talks set for Jan. 30-31  * Nvidia slumps after Q4 revenue forecast cut  * Indexes down: Dow 1.50 pct, S&P 1.31 pct, Nasdaq 1.73 pct (Updates to open)  Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dived on Monday, as weak forecasts from Caterpillar Inc and Nvidia Corp fueled worries about a slowdown in China taking a bigger bite off corporate profits.  Shares of Caterpillar, the world\u2019s largest heavy equipment maker, fell 8.1 percent as its quarterly profit widely missed Wall Street estimates, hit by softening demand in China, a strong dollar, and higher manufacturing and freight costs. The company\u2019s full-year earnings outlook also fell short of estimates.  Caterpillar was the biggest drag on the Dow and the S&P industrials index, which dropped 1.6 percent.  Nvidia slid 16 percent after the chipmaker cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars, hit by weak demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected datacenter sales.  Nvidia pulled down the Philadelphia semiconductor index by 2.9 percent, while the S&P technology index dropped 2.1 percent.  \u201cWith Caterpillar blaming China, investors are expecting to see more companies do the same in through the week,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.  \u201cThe quality of earnings so far isn\u2019t all that negative, but investors are clearly focusing more on what a company like Caterpillar would say.\u201d  Earlier, China data showed earnings at industrial firms shrank for a second month in December, hit by slowing prices and weak factory activity amid a protracted U.S.-China trade war.  As signs of a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy become stark, investors are pinning their hopes for a compromise between Washington and Beijing on trade when officials meet later this week.  The downbeat mood kept the 11 major S&P sectors and all the 30 Dow components in the red.  The S&P energy index dropped 1.6 percent as oil prices fell more than 2 percent after U.S. companies added rigs for the first time this year, a signal that crude output may rise further.  At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 371.95 points, or 1.50 percent, at 24,365.25, the S&P 500 was down 34.96 points, or 1.31 percent, at 2,629.80 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 123.76 points, or 1.73 percent, at 7,041.11.  Washington\u2019s move to end the 35-day long government shutdown boosted Wall Street on Friday. However, anxiety over another closure surfaced as President Donald Trump over the weekend expressed skepticism about lawmakers reaching a deal on border security that was acceptable to him.  Although, earnings have largely surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations, helping the S&P 500 climb about 12 percent from its December lows, worries about slowing global growth have tempered expectations and put a lid on stocks.  Of the 113 S&P 500 components that have reported so far, 72.6 percent have beaten profit estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  However, earnings growth estimate for the fourth quarter have dropped to 14.2 percent from 20.1 percent at the start of October, while 2019 profit growth estimates have come down to 5.6 percent from 10.2 percent in the same period.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 4.02-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.13-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

Treasury yields are expected to rise further ahead of Monday\u2019s auctions. The U.S. government will sell $81 billion in short-dated bills, $40 billion of two-year notes and $41 billion of five-year notes. An additional $78 billion will be sold on Tuesday.  Bond issuance has increased steadily since 2018 to fund President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts and spending increases. The latest flood of supply coincides with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaling that the central bank may pause its gradual increases in interest rates after U.S. economic data came in softer-than-expected in December and volatile financial markets whipped investors around.  Not all market participants were concerned that the increased supply, alongside expectations of a Fed pause, would decrease demand.

The world\u2019s biggest construction and mining equipment maker said it expects adjusted profit in 2020 in the range of $8.50 to $10 per share on the back of a further decline in equipment sales. The forecast is lower than $11.06 per share last year and below the average analyst estimate of $10.63 per share.  The Deerfield, Illinois-based company, considered a bellwether for economic activity, has been buffeted by the prolonged U.S.-China trade war that has made its customers wary of committing to large capital expenditures, hitting its sales and forcing production cuts.  With customers hesitant to spend on new equipment, it expects as much as a $1.5-billion reduction in dealer inventories this year.  Its shares were last down about 1.6% at $133.15, weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI.  Caterpillar's earnings comes a day after the world's largest package delivery company, United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N, forecast 2020 profit below estimates, citing global trade weakness and a slump in domestic industrial production.  The tit-for-tat tariff war between the world\u2019s two largest economies dragged down global growth last year to the lowest level since the global financial crisis. In the United States, it drove the manufacturing economy into a recession.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  The heavy equipment maker said retail demand for construction machines has softened in North America - its biggest market. It expects spending on both residential and non-residential construction to decline this year. Mining equipment sales, however, are projected to see a gradual recovery.  Sales in China were up in the quarter through December and are estimated to be flat to down 5% in 2020. But the outbreak of coronavirus could change those estimates.  The world\u2019s second-largest economy accounts for up to 10% of Caterpillar\u2019s sales. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield told Reuters that while none of the company\u2019s manufacturing facilities is in the worst-affected province, the outbreak has delayed the reopening of many of its facilities after the Chinese New Year by a week.  He said the company is monitoring the \u201cvery fluid\u201d situation.  To dampen the impact of economic swings, Caterpillar is focusing on shortening lead times and boosting the share of its more profitable and less cyclical services and parts business in overall revenues.  It is also trying to keep a lid on costs. That helped improve operating profit margin in the last quarter despite lower sales.  The company spent $6.2 billion on share buybacks and dividends last year. In contrast, capital expenditure was just $1.1 billion, which is forecast to rise to $1.2 billion this year.  At the end of 2019, it had a cash balance of $8.3 billion.  Lower tax rates helped the company post quarterly adjusted profit of $2.63 per share, higher than Wall Street\u2019s estimates and above $2.55 per share last year.","42":"April 24 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc:  * CATERPILLAR REPORTS FIRST-QUARTER 2018 RESULTS  * Q1 ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE $2.82  * Q1 SALES $12.9 BILLION VERSUS I\/B\/E\/S VIEW $12.07 BILLION  * Q1 EARNINGS PER SHARE VIEW $2.13 -- THOMSON REUTERS I\/B\/E\/S  * Q1 EARNINGS PER SHARE $2.74  * SEES FY 2018 EARNINGS PER SHARE $9.75 TO $10.75  * RAISED FULL-YEAR PROFIT PER SHARE OUTLOOK  * \u201cBASED ON OUR STRONG FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS AND HIGHER DEMAND ACROSS ALL REGIONS AND MOST END MARKETS, WE ARE RAISING OUR OUTLOOK FOR 2018\u201d  * CATERPILLAR WORLDWIDE FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT WAS ABOUT 99,700 AT END OF Q1 OF 2018  * DEALER MACHINE AND ENGINE INVENTORIES INCREASED ABOUT $1.2 BILLION IN Q1 2018, VERSUS INCREASE OF ABOUT $200 MILLION IN Q1 OF 2017  * AT END OF Q1 OF 2018, ORDER BACKLOG WAS ABOUT $17.5 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF ABOUT $1.7 BILLION FROM END OF 2017  * \u201cWE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR GLOBAL SUPPLIERS TO RESPOND TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN DEMAND\u201d  * AT END OF Q1 OF 2018, PAST DUES AT CAT FINANCIAL WERE 3.17 PERCENT, COMPARED WITH 2.64 PERCENT AT END OF Q1 OF 2017  * REVISED OUTLOOK RANGE FOR ADJUSTED PROFIT IS $10.25 TO $11.25 PER SHARE FOR FY  * AS OF MARCH 31, 2018, CAT FINANCIAL\u2019S ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TOTALED $403 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $346 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2017  * FY OUTLOOK INCLUDES ABOUT $400 MILLION OF RESTRUCTURING COSTS, UNCHANGED FROM PREVIOUS OUTLOOK  * WITH RESPECT TO SUPPLIERS, ALTHOUGH CONSTRAINTS REMAIN FOR SOME PARTS & COMPONENTS, CO SEEING IMPROVEMENTS IN MATERIAL FLOWS  * \u201cALTHOUGH CONSTRAINTS REMAIN FOR SOME PARTS AND COMPONENTS, WE ARE SEEING IMPROVEMENTS IN MATERIAL FLOWS\u201d  * 2018 SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS NOW EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $1.4 BILLION, NEARLY THE SAME AS 2017  * IMPROVED PRICE REALIZATION IN 2018 EXPECTED TO BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MATERIAL COST INCREASES PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER COMMODITY PRICES  * SAYS BELIEVES GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND FAVORABLE COMMODITY PRICE LEVELS WILL DRIVE MINERS TO INCREASE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2018  * SAYS STRONG GLOBAL DEMAND FOR COMMODITIES IS EXPECTED TO BE A POSITIVE FOR HEAVY CONSTRUCTION AND QUARRY AND AGGREGATE CUSTOMERS  * IN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES, SEES BROAD-BASED GROWTH IN ALL REGIONS IN 2018  * FY2018 EARNINGS PER SHARE VIEW $9.28 -- THOMSON REUTERS I\/B\/E\/S  * FOR ENERGY & TRANSPORTATION, SALES INTO OIL & GAS APPLICATIONS SEEN INCREASING IN 2018  * INCREASING 2018 PROFIT OUTLOOK BY $2.00 PER SHARE TO A RANGE OF $9.75 TO $10.75 PER SHARE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","43":"FILE PHOTO: Caterpillar Inc. equipment is on display for sale at a retail site in San Diego, California, U.S., March 3, 2017.

Shares of Caterpillar Inc and Nvidia Corp sank 10 percent and 15 percent, respectively, after the two manufacturers joined a growing list of companies to warn on the crippling effects of the fall-off in growth in the world\u2019s most populous country.  Apple Inc, a host of chipmakers, and FedEx Corp had already stoked fears of a global slowdown, particularly in a technology sector that depends heavily on China to drive revenue.  It does not bode well, several analysts said, for the rest of an earnings season that has only just got under way.  \u201cThe negative forecasts from Caterpillar and Nvidia really point to those areas of concern with trade, global economic activity and the potential impact of a strong dollar,\u201d Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said.  China\u2019s economy cooled in the fourth quarter under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs, dragging 2018 growth to the lowest level in nearly three decades.  President Trump is bent on curbing what Washington says is Beijing\u2019s deliberate theft of American intellectual property and trade secrets. Without progress in the weeks ahead, he has threatened a new round of tariffs from March 2.  Monday\u2019s stock market declines, following an unusual warning from Apple earlier this month, underline the flip side of such moves for U.S. companies.  Asia-Pacific was Caterpillar\u2019s only region to record a fall in revenue, but the end result - including a handful of other factors - was a more than 40-cent miss on earnings per share in the fourth quarter.  Nvidia cut its fourth quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars to just $2.2 billion. That added to a previous number that was already $700 million short of analysts\u2019 forecasts and was blamed chiefly on gaming revenue in China.  \u201cAcross the broad spectrum ranging from heavy equipment to semiconductors, business in China is slowing down,\u201d said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.  \u201cThe question is what does the tariff controversy factor into the slowdown. You can\u2019t answer that question yet. There\u2019s no way to predict it.\u201d  There could be more pain, starting later on Monday when washing machine maker Whirlpool Corp reports. Boeing Co follows on Wednesday, along with a host of tech heavyweights.  \u201cChina is an issue for companies doing business there as their economy is slowing,\u201d said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager, Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.  \u201cIn general we are trying to steer clear of a lot of China exposure.\u201d (Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bengaluru, Additional reporting by Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru and Caroline Valetkevitch in New York; Editing by Bernard Orr)","51":"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc spooked investors for a second straight quarter as rising costs hit margins in its construction equipment business and tepid sales in the Asia Pacific region pointed to continuing subdued growth in China.  FILE PHOTO: A row of excavators are seen at the Caterpillar booth at the CONEXPO-CON\/AGG convention at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. March 9, 2017. REUTERS\/David Becker\/File Photo  Shares of the company, considered a bellwether for economic activity whose results often influence global stock market sentiment, fell as much as 4 percent, overturning an initial rise due to overall results that were flattered by a tax gain.  The latest results come after the world\u2019s largest heavy duty equipment maker warned in the fourth quarter that construction activity in China could cool after two years of significant growth.  Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield, however, said on Wednesday that the industry saw stronger-than-expected activity in China ahead of the Chinese New Year, though full-year sales would remain flat for Caterpillar in the region.  China accounts for up to 10 percent of the company's sales and is critical to its growth prospects as it is one of the world's largest commodities importers. Steady growth here in China the first quarter, coming off a sharp slowdown in the previous quarter, has added to optimism that the country's economy may be starting to stabilize.  Caterpillar said sales of construction equipment in the Asia-Pacific region were flat in the first quarter, excluding the impact of currency. They fell 4 percent on a reported basis.  \u201cCaterpillar has most exposure to China in their construction industry business and that business was just a bit disappointing on revenue and margins,\u201d Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said.  Operating margin in the construction equipment business, Caterpillar\u2019s biggest, fell to 18.5 percent from 19.7 percent a year earlier as higher manufacturing and freight costs ate into profits.  The company reported first-quarter construction revenue of $5.87 billion, missing analysts\u2019 expectation of $5.95 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.  Still, overall revenue rose about 5 percent to $13.5 billion and beat estimates, thanks to a 7 percent rise in sales in North America, its biggest market.  The company also raised its full-year profit forecast as it booked a gain in the first quarter related to tax reforms.  Caterpillar said it now expects 2019 profit of $12.06 per share to $13.06 per share, compared with $11.75 to $12.75 per share forecast earlier.  Excluding tax gains, the company maintained its 2019 earnings targets.  The company reported an adjusted profit of $2.94 per share in the first quarter, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $2.85 a share.  Shares of the company were down 3 percent at $138 in morning trading. The stock part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average was the biggest drag on the index.","52":"(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc on Monday missed quarterly earnings estimates, hurt by soft Chinese demand, higher manufacturing and freight costs, sending shares of the heavy machinery maker tumbling as much as 10 percent.  Industrial bellwether Caterpillar now expects construction equipment sales in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, to be flat this year. China, which accounts for up to 10 percent of company sales, last week reported its slowest economic growth in nearly three decades.  Caterpillar posted a decline in construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region in the latest quarter due to the cooling China demand.  Since China is one of the world\u2019s largest commodities importers, its slowing economy is having a ripple effect on global commodities prices, which can also hurt the company\u2019s equipment sales in the mining and oil and gas industry, for example.  Caterpillar downplayed the slump in China, citing a \u201cvery strong\u201d performance a year ago, but did not break out sales. Chinese construction demand was up 40 percent in 2018 after doubling in 2017.  Caterpillar forecast 2019 adjusted profit of $11.75 to $12.75 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $12.73, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Sales for the year are expected to increase modestly.  Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said profits this year will be weighed down by a higher U.S. tax rate and increased freight and material costs.  \u201cWe expect favorable price realization to be mostly offset by cost headwinds,\u201d he told analysts on a conference call.  Caterpillar, a proxy for global economic activity, benefited in the past year from what the International Monetary Fund called the strongest global growth surge since 2010.  However, a tariff war between the United States and trade partners including China has stoked fears of a global slowdown.  The tariffs cost the company over $100 million last year. No relief was expected from higher import duties this year, the company said.  Lawrence De Maria, a William Blair analyst, said the 2019 forecast was \u201cindicative of slowing growth and a maturing cycle that implies peak markets, and effectively may put a lid on any cyclical industrial rally for now.\u201d  In the quarter, the Deerfield, Illinois-based company reported an adjusted profit of $2.55 per share, well below the average analyst estimate of $2.99, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total sales and revenue in the quarter rose 11 percent year on year to $14.34 billion.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Manufacturing costs shot up by 3 percentage points in the fourth quarter from the third quarter.  An increase in the provision for credit losses and write-offs in its financial products segment also cut into fourth-quarter earnings for the world\u2019s largest heavy-duty equipment maker.  The company posted lower-than-expected earnings for the first time in ten quarters, helping propel a sell-off in broader stock markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average. was down 1.2 percent.  Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby told investors on the call that the company was closely monitoring costs and was in better shape to handle any market downturn.  Caterpillar slid 8.9 percent at $124.70 in afternoon trading, but fell as low as $123.15 early in the session. Shares lost 19.4 percent in 2018, compared with a 15 percent drop in S&P 500 index and a 5.6 percent decline in the Dow.  Volatile oil prices brought down Caterpillar\u2019s order book in the last quarter by about $800 million from the September quarter.  The company expects volatile oil prices to hurt its energy and transportation business this year. However, it anticipates that higher commodities prices will continue to drive capital expenditures in the mining industry, underpinning demand for heavy construction and quarry machinery.  Caterpillar spent $5.8 billion in shares buybacks and dividend payments and $1.17 billion in capital expenditure in 2018. It ended the year with a cash balance of $7.9 billion.","53":"Feb 15 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc said on Thursday it was vigorously contesting the $2.3 billion tax and penalties for certain years proposed by the Internal Revenue Service.  In March last year, the IRS had challenged the company\u2019s taxes for 2007-2012, and federal law enforcement officials raided three of the company\u2019s buildings in Illinois in connection with a probe regarding its offshore tax practices.  The heavy machinery manufacturer said in a regulatory filing that it did not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to its unrecognized tax benefits for this matter within the next 12 months.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/Files  The heavy equipment maker, however, said the pace of decline in sales of its yellow bulldozers, mining trucks and other equipment was moderating, helped by a fast economic recovery in China and improvement in residential activity in North America.  \u201cI feel better today than I did a quarter ago,\u201d Chief Executive Jim Umpleby told investors on an earnings call, adding the pandemic and its impact on the global economy would determine the strength of the recovery.  The company did not provide an updated earnings guidance due to COVID-19 uncertainties. However, it said the decline in machine sales would moderate further in the quarter through December.  Operating profit is also forecast to improve in the current quarter from a quarter ago. Share repurchases, however, will remain suspended this year.  Caterpillar\u2019s shares were down 2.9% at $158.32 in morning trading. The stock has gained over 20% since the last earnings report, outperforming the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average, on hopes that the worst is over for its business.  The Illinois-based company, a bellwether for economic activity, has been suffering from business uncertainty caused by the U.S.-China trade standoff and the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced customers delay capital expenditure.  Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said while the demand for smaller machines has improved, customers were still hesitant to invest in heavy and more expensive equipment.  Reflecting weak equipment demand, Caterpillar now expects dealer inventories to decline by $2.5 billion this year compared with a more than $2 billion fall estimated earlier.

However, it said that cuts in the inventory carried by the network of retailers who sell its products would accelerate further in the fourth quarter and see continued \u201cmoderate\u201d pricing for its range of goods next year.  Sales in Asia-Pacific, its third biggest market, fell 13% as it faced falling demand in China and competition from cut-price domestic rivals, while revenue in its main developed world market in North America fell almost 3%.  That drove an initial slide of 5% in the company\u2019s shares, now only marginally higher this year, and left analysts predicting little immediate improvement.  \u201cWhile inventory reduction should set the company up for easier comparisons in 2020, trends in all three end markets continue to decelerate, raising the question of how far ahead the market is willing to discount the shares,\u201d said Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann.

CONSTRUCTION SLUMP  Caterpillar said the slump in Asia was led by a 29% plunge in construction equipment sales and Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby said he expected overall demand in the fourth quarter to be flat.  Total sales and revenue for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 5.6% from a year earlier to $12.76 billion.  \u201cSales in Asia\/Pacific were lower across most of the region primarily due to lower demand in China, including unfavorable changes in dealer inventories, amid continued competitive pressures,\u201d the company said.  Chris Sleight, managing director of consultancy Off-Highway Research, said the Chinese market was becoming increasingly difficult for overseas firms because most of the local players had become focused on winning market share and selling high volumes over profitability.  \u201cI think that when a lot of people are selling excavators now in China they\u2019re selling at a loss,\u201d he said.  Caterpillar sales have improved since the company managed to halt a four-year slide in 2016, but Wall Street analysts have been warning that demand in more than half of its end markets had peaked.  Finance chief Andrew Bonfield said dealers had reduced the value of stock they were holding by $400 million in the third quarter and were likely to cut by another $900 million in the final three months of the year, a stark contrast to an $800 million ramp-up in the third quarter a year ago.  The company is seen as one of Wall Street\u2019s clearer gauges of the state of Chinese demand and its impact on big western multinationals.  Caterpillar said the impact of tariffs imposed on its goods as a result of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing would now be lower than the $250 million to $350 million range it gave earlier this year.  But it also cut its 2019 expectations for profit to between $10.90 and $11.40 per share compared with a prior estimate of $12.06 to $13.06.

Shares of Caterpillar, the world\u2019s largest heavy equipment maker, fell 8.4 percent as its quarterly profit widely missed Wall Street estimates, hit by softening demand in China and higher manufacturing and freight costs. Its full-year earnings outlook also fell short of estimates.  Caterpillar was the biggest drag on the Dow and the S&P industrials index, which dropped 1.3 percent.  Nvidia tumbled 12.2 percent after the chipmaker cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars on weak demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected datacenter sales.

The downbeat corporate updates came in an earnings-heavy week that also includes the Federal Reserve\u2019s first policy meeting this year and jobs data.  Although earnings have largely surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations, helping the S&P 500 climb about 12 percent from its December lows, worries about slowing global growth have tempered expectations and put a lid on stocks.

Since the earnings kicked off two weeks ago, analysts\u2019 estimates for fourth-quarter profit growth have stayed steady at about 14 percent, but expectations for 2019 earnings growth has dropped to 5.6 percent from 6.3 percent.

Caterpillar Inc, whose large exposure to China makes it a proxy for the global impact of trade tensions, dropped 5.8% after reporting a fall in quarterly earnings on cooling demand for construction machines in Asia.  The world\u2019s largest planemaker matched that with its biggest loss in decades on the back of this year\u2019s grounding of its best-selling 737 MAX planes after two deadly crashes. Boeing\u2019s shares fell 1.2%.  Two weeks into the guts of an earnings season for which investors have already dialed down expectations, the manufacturing firms\u2019 results came on the same day as a grim set of forward-looking surveys on the euro zone economy.  \u201cCaterpillar\u2019s results show that there is weakness in the Asia Pacific region, and if there is a slowdown there, where is the next pocket of slowdown, and people could start extrapolating from that,\u201d said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.  \u201cCaterpillar\u2019s earnings are more important than Boeing, because Boeing\u2019s issues are more company specific.\u201d  The bleak earnings of the industrial heavyweights resulted in the blue-chip Dow index falling more than the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes.  Nearly 80% of the 104 S&P 500 companies to report so far have topped earnings expectations, and overall profits are expected to rise about 1%, according to Refinitiv, improving from a small decline estimated previously.  Shares of Texas Instruments Inc jumped 7% and helped lift the Philadelphia chip index by 1.7%, after the company said a global slowdown in microchip demand would not be as long as feared as it posted quarterly profit and revenue that beat estimates.  At 9:43 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 131.66 points, or 0.48%, at 27,217.53, the S&P 500 was down 2.97 points, or 0.10%, at 3,002.50. The Nasdaq Composite was down 5.07 points, or 0.06%, at 8,246.33.  Sentiment, however, remains shaky and other corporate news, including the announcement of a broad antitrust investigation by the U.S. Justice Department into the tech sector, fed into the losses.  The DoJ did not identify specific companies, but the terms of the review pointed to Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc. Shares of all three fell about 1% and weighed the most on indexes.  Facebook, which reports earnings later on Wednesday, was also the subject of a pair of settlements announced by regulators on privacy issues that included fines of more than $5 billion, again well-flagged previously.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.32-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.04-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

Giving employees sick time without penalty, temperature screenings, staggered shifts and hiring a hygiene-auditing firm are some of the measures the two companies have taken to reassure employees to stay on production lines when many union and non-union workers balk at reporting for jobs that could expose them to the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  Detroit\u2019s auto companies had to negotiate long and hard with the United Auto Workers, which represents their hourly workers, over how and when to restart U.S. production. The UAW blocked the automakers\u2019 plans to restart their factories on May 4.  The union this week signaled its members are ready to go back to work at General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's U.S. factories on May 18.  By contrast, the UAW let Deere resume production at two of its facilities within days of employees testing positive for the virus.  Union officials attribute that decision to a safety policy they negotiated with the company that mandates a strict implementation of guidelines prescribed by the nation\u2019s health protection agency and the World Health Organization.  But it was a provision for expanded benefits that sealed the deal, UAW officials say.  \u201cOne of our priorities on the health and safety issue is to make sure that our members can self-report without any kind of penalty,\u201d said Brian Rothenberg, the UAW\u2019s public relations director.

EXPANDED BENEFITS  Under its agreement with the UAW, Deere is providing paid sick leave to cover the recommended 14 days of self-quarantine, even to workers who think they have been exposed to the virus but are not certain and have not been tested.  \u201cThe last thing we wanted was for individuals to feel compelled to come to work to get paid,\u201d a Deere official said.  The Moline, Illinois-based company altered shift schedules to ensure employees from one shift exit before the next shift reports to work. It hired an industrial-hygiene company to audit the sanitization work at some of its larger units.  Additionally, the farm equipment maker enhanced pay provisions to cover the challenges workers face due to day care and school closings. It also waived copays, coinsurance and deductibles for its employees for coronavirus testing.  At Caterpillar, the UAW and the United Steelworkers have negotiated a similar paid sick leave policy for their members.  The heavy equipment maker is offering workers paid sick leave up to 2 weeks if they have been instructed to self-quarantine. The benefit also can be used for taking care of immediate family members.  Production employees are allowed time off up to 10 weeks at 2\/3 of their salary for child care.  Caterpillar spokeswoman Kate Kenny said the benefits are available to all employees who are unable to work from home, not just union members.  Workers are required to go for temperature checks before entering some facilities. To ensure social distancing, lunch hours have been extended at some locations and visitor access has been limited.

Factories are hobbled by supply shortages, weakened demand and increased absenteeism among workers.  Caterpillar\u2019s retail sales dropped by 20% in North America in March.

Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said Caterpillar is managing production by segment and adjusting its workforce by facility.  The situation at Deere is also uncertain. The company will temporarily suspend production at its Davenport and Dubuque facilities in Iowa on May 11 for two weeks due to supply chain disruptions.

Shares of Caterpillar, the world\u2019s largest heavy equipment maker, fell 9.3 percent after its quarterly profit widely missed Wall Street estimates, hit by softening demand in China and higher manufacturing and freight costs.  The company\u2019s shares were on track for their worst day since August 2011, accounting for nearly a quarter of the Dow\u2019s fall. The S&P industrial index dropped 1.4 percent.  Nvidia tumbled 13.8 percent after the chipmaker cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars on weak demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected data center sales.  The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 2.1 percent, while the S&P technology index dropped 1.8 percent.  \u201cEvery time we get earnings stating China as a problem, investors start to realize that issues with China are going to spread and without China growing at a good clip it will be hard for the global economy and the U.S. to continue an expansion,\u201d said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada.  Global stocks started on the back foot after China data showed earnings at industrial firms shrank for a second straight month in December, hit by slowing prices and weak factory activity amid a protracted trade war with the United States.  As signs of a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy become stark, investors are pinning their hopes for a compromise between Washington and Beijing on trade when officials meet later this week.  \u201cWith the Chinese economy struggling the way it is and with companies feeling the impact, the U.S. is also starting to realize that there is enough motivation to get a deal done. It\u2019s just a question of when,\u201d said Nauman.  Although earnings have largely surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations, helping the S&P 500 climb about 12 percent from its December lows, worries about slowing global growth have tempered expectations and put a lid on stocks.  Of the 113 S&P 500 components that have reported so far, 72.6 percent have beaten profit estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Since the reporting season kicked off two weeks ago, analysts\u2019 estimates for fourth-quarter profit growth have stayed steady at about 14 percent, but expectations for 2019 earnings growth has dropped to 5.6 percent from 6.3 percent.  At 12:44 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 338.08 points, or 1.37 percent, at 24,399.12, the S&P 500 was down 31.94 points, or 1.20 percent, at 2,632.82 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 103.65 points, or 1.45 percent, at 7,061.21.  Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower. Amazon.com Inc , Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp \u2014 all set to report later this week \u2014 were down more than 2 percent, dragging down the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.  The S&P energy index dropped 1.7 percent as oil prices fell after U.S. companies added rigs for the first time this year, a signal that crude output may rise further.

FILE PHOTO: A Caterpillar excavator is displayed at the China Coal and Mining Expo 2013 in Beijing, China October 22, 2013. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon  The audience is Caterpillar\u2019s local network of dealers, who inspect the machines for the latest technological innovations to help make their sales pitches to buyers in China.  However, much of the heavy equipment could find its way to construction and mining projects in places like Pakistan or Kazakhstan, or as far away as Africa.  Caterpillar has been investing heavily in China \u2013 the Nantong facility is one of 25 similar ones it has set up across the country \u2013 in the hopes of cracking the largest construction and mining equipment market in the world.  Helping fuel the growth of that market, Caterpillar executives and analysts say, is China\u2019s Belt and Road initiative, a huge infrastructure spending spree that builds on the old Silk Road trading routes. The ambitious and ever-growing $1 trillion initiative now includes projects spanning Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  \u201cBelt and Road is becoming a very important driver for Caterpillar\u2019s development,\u201d said Chen Qihua, head of Caterpillar China, at the Nantong facility.  The world\u2019s biggest equipment maker doesn\u2019t reveal its sales tied directly to Belt and Road projects, or break out its China revenues.  But analysts say its Asia-Pacific sales figures reflect demand for machines destined for Belt and Road projects as contractors buy most of their equipment in China to take advantage of tax rebates handed out for the initiative. Chen said contractors prefer to buy machines in China to take advantage of the rebates.  Asia-Pacific sales increased 22 percent in the last quarter of 2017 over the previous year, with construction demand in China accounting for about half that increase, Caterpillar said in January. It said it expected demand to remain strong at least through the first half of 2018.  (Graphic on Caterpillar's sales: tmsnrt.rs\/2ExfXqr)  Once purchased in China, the equipment is shipped off to projects across the vast geography of the initiative and put to work building power plants in Pakistan, constructing highways in Belarus or developing new mines in Africa. Most of the equipment sent is made in China, Chen said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Lawrence Poh, executive director at Caterpillar\u2019s largest dealer in China, told Reuters at his office in Kunshan, just outside Shanghai, that orders had increased due to demand from Belt and Road projects. He did not provide details.  COMPETITION  While China has been a bright spot for Caterpillar, it is facing competition from cheaper construction equipment made by Chinese companies, particularly in China. Other Western companies such as General Electric, Honeywell and Maersk are also vying for orders, particularly in the energy and transportation segment.  Joshua Yau, a Hong Kong-based Belt and Road analyst at Strategy&, an arm of the PwC consultancy, says Chinese construction equipment companies like Zoomlion and Sany Heavy Industries dominate sales inside China.  But Yau said that outside China, Caterpillar\u2019s advanced technology and global network made it a better option.  \u201cCaterpillar is mostly getting the orders where Chinese equipment suppliers are not competitive,\u201d said Yau. He added that Chinese products were generally viewed as inferior in terms of quality and technology.  Caterpillar\u2019s sales pitch is that its machines use less fuel and help construction teams work faster. Advanced software helps track the machines\u2019 performance, and when things go wrong it has a network of more than 170 dealers and 2,000 branches around the world to help with repairs.  \u201cIn the geographies where they are newcomers, Chinese contractors can leverage CAT\u2019s overseas network to help compete and win projects,\u201d Yau said.  In Africa, for instance, a piece of equipment sold by a China-based dealer for a project in Kenya or Algeria could be serviced by a Caterpillar dealer on the continent.  \u201cIt\u2019s very easy for us to align with other dealers,\u201d Poh said. \u201cOnce our equipment goes abroad, they will need to provide good maintenance and upkeep for the customer in order to allow the equipment to perform at their best.\u201d  Analysts said a lack of overseas dealer networks and a perceived shortfall in quality meant Chinese rivals were struggling to expand their share of the global market.  \u201cThe low-labour cost advantage associated with these Chinese companies will hold less sway as products become increasingly complex and quality standards significantly increase,\u201d analysts at Morningstar wrote in a recent note.  Caterpillar is also deploying its financing arm to spur Belt and Road sales, company executives said. Since the launch of the initiative, the financing arm has started lending to Chinese companies, including state-owned enterprises, to help bridge their funding gaps. Caterpillar does not disclose specific data for such lending.  MULTI-YEAR BOOST  Still, Belt and Road is also providing opportunities for Chinese construction companies.  A study by Off-Highway Research found that countries along the Belt and Road accounted for 30 percent of Sany\u2019s overall sales in 2016-2017.

The audience is Caterpillar\u2019s local network of dealers, who inspect the machines for the latest technological innovations to help make their sales pitches to buyers in China.  However, much of the heavy equipment could find its way to construction and mining projects in places like Pakistan or Kazakhstan, or as far away as Africa.  Caterpillar has been investing heavily in China \u2013 the Nantong facility is one of 25 similar ones it has set up across the country \u2013 in the hopes of cracking the largest construction and mining equipment market in the world.  Helping fuel the growth of that market, Caterpillar executives and analysts say, is China\u2019s Belt and Road initiative, a huge infrastructure spending spree that builds on the old Silk Road trading routes. The ambitious and ever-growing $1 trillion initiative now includes projects spanning Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  \u201cBelt and Road is becoming a very important driver for Caterpillar\u2019s development,\u201d said Chen Qihua, head of Caterpillar China, at the Nantong facility.  The world\u2019s biggest equipment maker doesn\u2019t reveal its sales tied directly to Belt and Road projects, or break out its China revenues.  But analysts say its Asia-Pacific sales figures reflect demand for machines destined for Belt and Road projects as contractors buy most of their equipment in China to take advantage of tax rebates handed out for the initiative. Chen said contractors prefer to buy machines in China to take advantage of the rebates.  Asia-Pacific sales increased 22 percent in the last quarter of 2017 over the previous year, with construction demand in China accounting for about half that increase, Caterpillar said in January. It said it expected demand to remain strong at least through the first half of 2018.  Once purchased in China, the equipment is shipped off to projects across the vast geography of the initiative and put to work building power plants in Pakistan, constructing highways in Belarus or developing new mines in Africa. Most of the equipment sent is made in China, Chen said.  Lawrence Poh, executive director at Caterpillar\u2019s largest dealer in China, told Reuters at his office in Kunshan, just outside Shanghai, that orders had increased due to demand from Belt and Road projects. He did not provide details.  COMPETITION  While China has been a bright spot for Caterpillar, it is facing competition from cheaper construction equipment made by Chinese companies, particularly in China. Other Western companies such as General Electric, Honeywell and Maersk are also vying for orders, particularly in the energy and transportation segment.  Joshua Yau, a Hong Kong-based Belt and Road analyst at Strategy&, an arm of the PwC consultancy, says Chinese construction equipment companies like Zoomlion and Sany Heavy Industries dominate sales inside China.  But Yau said that outside China, Caterpillar\u2019s advanced technology and global network made it a better option.  \u201cCaterpillar is mostly getting the orders where Chinese equipment suppliers are not competitive,\u201d said Yau. He added that Chinese products were generally viewed as inferior in terms of quality and technology.  Caterpillar\u2019s sales pitch is that its machines use less fuel and help construction teams work faster. Advanced software helps track the machines\u2019 performance, and when things go wrong it has a network of more than 170 dealers and 2,000 branches around the world to help with repairs.  \u201cIn the geographies where they are newcomers, Chinese contractors can leverage CAT\u2019s overseas network to help compete and win projects,\u201d Yau said.  In Africa, for instance, a piece of equipment sold by a China-based dealer for a project in Kenya or Algeria could be serviced by a Caterpillar dealer on the continent.  \u201cIt\u2019s very easy for us to align with other dealers,\u201d Poh said. \u201cOnce our equipment goes abroad, they will need to provide good maintenance and upkeep for the customer in order to allow the equipment to perform at their best.\u201d  Analysts said a lack of overseas dealer networks and a perceived shortfall in quality meant Chinese rivals were struggling to expand their share of the global market.  \u201cThe low-labour cost advantage associated with these Chinese companies will hold less sway as products become increasingly complex and quality standards significantly increase,\u201d analysts at Morningstar wrote in a recent note.  Caterpillar is also deploying its financing arm to spur Belt and Road sales, company executives said. Since the launch of the initiative, the financing arm has started lending to Chinese companies, including state-owned enterprises, to help bridge their funding gaps. Caterpillar does not disclose specific data for such lending.  MULTI-YEAR BOOST  Still, Belt and Road is also providing opportunities for Chinese construction companies.  A study by Off-Highway Research found that countries along the Belt and Road accounted for 30 percent of Sany\u2019s overall sales in 2016-2017. At XCMG Construction Machinery , 75 percent of overseas sales came from countries associated with the initiative. Sales figures were not provided.  Analysts and Caterpillar executives say Belt and Road, on which Beijing says it wants to spend as much as $150 billion a year outside China, offers ample opportunities for all manufacturers.  \u201cAs government funding for the BRI projects improves, this is expected to result in higher demand throughout the industry,\u201d said Jeff Hardee, director of Asia-Pacific government & corporate affairs at Caterpillar in Singapore, referring to the initiative.","88":"(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text)  CLAYTON, N.C., Sept 21 (Reuters) - Six months into the U.S. tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, Caterpillar Inc is finding that one of the best ways it can protect profits is a cost cutting strategy that is more than two years old.  At this sprawling factory in central North Carolina where it makes small front-end loaders, the company laid off workers in 2016 in response to plunging sales, consolidating two shifts into one under a program it calls the Operation & Execution Model.  Even though demand has picked up since then, its Clayton plant still runs a single shift and operates only four days a week. One third of the facility\u2019s 550 employees are on flexible contracts.  The result: CAT is producing more loaders here with 30 percent fewer people on the factory floor than in the past, the company told Reuters.  It has redesigned all new machines it makes with over 20 percent fewer parts, cutting back on the consumption of steel which brings down the cost, Tony Fassino, vice president at Caterpillar\u2019s building construction products, said after a factory tour in Clayton.  \u201cFewer parts numbers are a huge win,\u201d Fassino told Reuters. \u201cIt improves safety, it improves the quality, it improves the cost.\u201d  Now, these cost cutting approaches are helping counter the financial impact of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars.  The heavy-duty equipment maker estimates the import tariffs will inflate its raw materials costs by up to $200 million between July and December, though it does not provide a forecast for manufacturing costs in 2018. Caterpillar has said it would offset the impact through a price increase that went into effect on July 1 and general cost cutting measures, helping it post a record profit for all of 2018.  Caterpillar\u2019s increasing emphasis on operating efficiency has proven timely, helping to bring down the cost of production at a time when material expenses are mounting on Trump\u2019s import curbs, and capacity constraints are driving up freight costs.  For graphic click: tmsnrt.rs\/2NG2DrF  An internal calculation provided to Reuters, previously unreported, shows that the measures have accounted for half of the improvements in the profit margins since 2015 at the company\u2019s construction industries division. Since January 2017, the efficiency model has been rolled out across the company, but CAT would not disclose more details.  CAT, Deere & Co and Harley-Davidson Inc are among the many manufacturers trying to keep a lid on expenses to cope with a 30 percent rise in U.S. steel prices since the start of 2018.  Those rising costs, along with a tit-for-tat tariff war with China, have clouded the earnings outlook for industrial companies, dragging down their shares.  Despite a recent rally this month, Caterpillar shares are down about 9 percent from their late-January levels, compared with a 0.4 percent decline in S&P 500 industrials index , showing investors have yet to fully reward the company for its industry-best efficiency results when it comes to operating margins and return on net operating assets.  For graphic click tmsnrt.rs\/2CN5P0g  Steve Volkmann, a machinery analyst at Jefferies, attributes the stock\u2019s underperformance to concerns that the company\u2019s greater exposure to foreign markets and a sizeable presence in China make it more vulnerable to escalating trade wars.  \u201cIt is disappointing that they can\u2019t get paid for good quarters these days,\u201d he said, referring to the company\u2019s strong earnings in the last quarter.  While overseas markets do account for more than half of Caterpillar\u2019s sales, the company has an evenly spread manufacturing footprint across the globe, which Volkmann and other analysts say make it better placed to deal with the tariffs.  The company has also tried to put at rest worries about its operations in China, saying the trade tensions have not impacted its business there.  COST CONTROL  As part of its cost cutting effort, CAT business heads have been mandated to reduce the overall manufacturing cost of every new product by at least 5 percent, one Caterpillar company executive told Reuters. This entails cost cuts by suppliers as well.  Donaldson Company Inc - which makes filters for CAT\u2019s machines - told Reuters that it tries lower the cost of production every year through material substitution or automation or efficiency gains. Cuts in travel and entertainment budgets helped the company improve operating income by 40 basis points in the latest quarter.  CAT\u2019s Operation and Execution effort affects both production strategy decisions and small details of every operation.  For example, it does not make smaller front-wheel loaders in the United States even though their sales in North America are growing. Instead, semi-finished machines are shipped in from overseas factories to the Clayton facility, where tires and buckets are installed, Fassino said.  This not only allows better utilization of the company\u2019s factories, but also provides flexibility to tailor the machines to the requirements of local customers.  Similarly, CAT has been managing freight contracts for deliveries across North America since 2016. Apart from improving the predictability of deliveries, and reducing insurance and damage claims, the contracts are letting Caterpillar leverage its scale and volume to moderate transportation costs in its supply chain.  OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY  At the Clayton plant, the company\u2019s focus on lean manufacturing, efficiency and flexible cost is on full display.  Parts are put in a sequential order in stand-up bag carts next to the assembly line so that assemblers do not have to spend time looking for them.  Suppliers have been instructed to pack the parts in the same way. In case the parts do not arrive in the required order, workers in the factory warehouse are required to unpack and rearrange the parts before they reach the factory floor.  Automation is increasingly being used to test machines. Components and parts are moved on tugger trains instead of by fork lifts to save time and cost.  \u201cSave one minute here and save five minutes there. Add all that up, you have two shifts to one shift,\u201d said Caterpillar\u2019s Fassino.","89":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc CAT.N on Tuesday reported a steeper-than-expected decline in first-quarter earnings, with sales falling across all regions and all primary business segments as the coronavirus pandemic devastated economies around the world.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  The Deerfield, Illinois-based heavy equipment manufacturer, considered a bellwether for economic activity, said the financial fallout of the health crisis in the quarter through June will be worse than the previous quarter.  Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby said the impact has been \u201csignificantly more severe and chaotic\u201d than any cyclical downturn. Caterpillar did not provide a 2020 financial outlook after rescinding the previous forecast last month.  \u201cThe ultimate impact of the pandemic on our 2020 results remains uncertain and will be based on the duration of the virus and the magnitude of the economic impact on global demand for our products,\u201d Umpleby said.  The company\u2019s shares fell about 1%, trading at $114.08 on the New York Stock Exchange.  The International Monetary Fund this month predicted the \u201cGreat Lockdown\u201d would result in the worst global recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Companies of all sizes have been trying to hoard cash and boost liquidity.  Caterpillar said its financial position remained \u201cstrong\u201d. During the first quarter, its enterprise operating cash flow was $1.130 billion. It ended the quarter with $7.1 billion in cash and has a $20.5 billion liquidity pool.  In the latest quarter, Caterpillar returned about $1.6 billion to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. It called paying dividends a \u201cpriority\u201d but said it would temporarily suspend share repurchases.  The pandemic-induced economic uncertainty is taking a heavy toll on prices for oil and other commodities, leading to sharp spending cuts for miners and drillers. That has hit industrials like Caterpillar which sell mining and oil and gas machines.  Sales at its energy & transportation and mining business, which accounts for 60% of the company\u2019s revenues, fell 19% during the quarter from a year ago.  Construction equipment sales declined an annual 27%.  As of mid-April, the company said about 75% of its primary production facilities were in operation. It said some facilities which were temporarily closed had reopened.  Adjusted profit for the quarter came in at $1.60 per share, down from $2.94 a year earlier and below the $1.69 forecast by analysts on average, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.","90":"(Adds details, quotes, share price)  CHICAGO, March 31 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc said on Tuesday it would withhold annual salary increases for senior executives, managers and salaried employees to contain costs due to the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on its business.

(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)","92":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc's CAT.N earnings on Wednesday missed Wall Street's estimates, hurt by a combination of weak sales in China and higher production and restructuring costs, sending its shares lower.  The heavy equipment maker said its full-year earnings are expected to be at the lower end of its earlier forecast.  The Deerfield, Illinois-based company, a proxy for global economic activity, benefited in the past year from the strongest global growth since 2010. However, a tariff war between the United States and trade partners including China has sapped business confidence, dampening economic activity.  The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday lowered its forecast for global growth this year and next, its fourth downgrade since October.  Caterpillar said while some of its customers are turning more circumspect in making large capital expenditures, overall demand remains positive.  \u201cWe continue to expect modest sales growth for the year,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby told analysts on an earnings call.  The sales outlook is driven mainly by an expected ramp-up in demand for mining machines and solar turbines.  In a worry for the company, sales of construction machines in China declined, dragged down by slowing economic activity and competitive pricing.  The world\u2019s second-largest economy accounts for up to 15% of Caterpillar\u2019s construction equipment sales. It is facing competition from local Chinese players trying to chip away at its market share through aggressive pricing.

REUTERS\/Michaela Rehle  The company said it was looking to counter the competition with new products rather than price cuts.  Profit in the June quarter suffered because of $110 million in restructuring costs, as well as a $328 million increase in manufacturing costs due to higher raw material prices, including a $70 million tariff bill.  Caterpillar still expects the tariffs to cost the company between $250 million and $350 million this year. But it said input prices are moderating and freight costs have stabilized.  Restructuring costs are also projected to be significantly lower in the second half of the year.  Some analysts have warned that more than half of Caterpillar\u2019s end markets have already peaked or will peak this year, which could translate into lower earnings next year.  The world\u2019s largest heavy-duty equipment maker experienced the longest downturn in its history when sales dropped more than 40% between 2012 and 2016.  Chastised by the sales slump, the company has been spending money on expanding its services and parts business, which has higher margins and is less cyclical. It is aiming to increase services revenue to $28 billion by 2026, up from $18 billion in 2018 and double what it was in 2016.  In the second quarter, Caterpillar reported net income of $1.62 billion, or $2.83 per share, compared with $1.71 billion, or $2.82 per share, a year ago.

(Reuters) - Orders for the mining machines and construction bulldozers made at this sprawling Caterpillar Inc. CAT.N factory in central Illinois have jumped, in general, three-fold over the past year.  But meeting that boom in demand at the world\u2019s largest heavy equipment manufacturer is a challenge, in part because of Caterpillar suppliers like Steve Kirsh.  Years of watching Caterpillar and other big manufacturers cut inventories, close plants and axe workers in the last downturn has embedded caution in Kirsh\u2019s ambition to expand after the surge in orders, reflecting a more fundamental shift in how many industrial businesses view expansions, according to interviews with Caterpillar executives, more than a half-dozen Caterpillar suppliers and U.S. economic data.  \u201cI just wasn\u2019t sure it was real,\u201d said Kirsh, speaking from a windowless office at the front of Kirsh Foundry Inc., in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, which makes metal parts for Caterpillar and other customers.  Even with a surplus in demand for its product, Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby told investors last month the company will not invest in factory capacity. Instead, it plans to spend more on new technologies, expanding its parts business and selling more rental and used equipment.  The company\u2019s big East Peoria assembly plant runs just one shift and operates only four days a week, while its own parts-making facilities are running three shifts, five days a week to provide it enough components to assemble, according to the company officials. Outside suppliers are similarly scrambling to catch up to the surge in orders.  This has extended the lead-time to deliver final products to dealers. For instance, it takes more than eight months to get one model of its large engines into a customer\u2019s hands.  The Trump administration\u2019s efforts to rewrite trade relations with key partners, especially China, only add to the uncertainty. The latest move to step back from a confrontation with China is good news for many domestic producers, who worry that a trade war could quickly puncture the global expansion, going on nine years, which is feeding the U.S. factory boom, manufacturing executives told Reuters.  The result is a drag on the economic expansion that President Trump and Republicans hoped for coming off U.S. corporate tax reform last year. The idea behind Trump\u2019s tax reform was that companies could pour more money into expansions, hire more workers and lift wages.  There has been an upswing in plans for capital spending, but much of it is concentrated in the technology and energy sectors. Spending plans by industrial companies are up only slightly. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2IBSzKF  For those companies that do want to expand, from car companies to railroads and engine makers, they often can\u2019t find the workers to expand fast enough.  The contraction of their supply chain in the last downturn thrust many players big and small into a \"just in time delivery\" business model, creating order backlogs, which has led to soaring prices for raw materials in the recent upswing. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2rY3iZp  Slideshow ( 8 images )  TURNING THE SWITCH BACK ON  The hesitation to expand Caterpillar\u2019s supply chain is rooted in the last bust, notable as the longest downturn in its history - worse than the Great Depression - from 2012 to 2016, when sales dropped more than 40 percent.  Chastised by that slump, the Deerfield, Ill.-based company embarked on a restructuring strategy that aims to squeeze more production from its factories and buy more of what it needs from outside suppliers on a just-in-time basis.  Caterpillar has closed or restructured more than 25 factories and its full-time workforce is smaller now than it was at the end of 2012. And cuts continue. Caterpillar plans to close two more facilities this year and is considering shuttering an engine plant, which would eliminate 880 jobs.  Caterpillar executives said the new strategy is boosting profitability by allowing it to get the best use out of its existing factories. They blame the backlogs on its suppliers\u2019 inability to keep up with the surge in orders.  Timing is part of the problem. Caterpillar and a host of other industrial companies all ramped up orders at the same time. \u201cThat switch got turned on after being turned off for several years - all at the same time,\u201d said Amy Campbell, director of investor relations.  Campbell, however, said the supply situation is improving. The central Illinois plant will go back to the normal five-day shift beginning in June.  Caterpillar\u2019s investors love this approach, since it helps deliver strong margins in the good times and minimizes pain in bad times.  The company recently boosted profit projections for 2018 by about 25 percent, and in the latest quarter, every segment posted better results compared to a year ago. But its stock price took a hit when the company\u2019s CFO warned higher prices for raw materials like steel are going to start squeezing margins even as growth continues.  Supply chain bottlenecks, meanwhile, are hitting companies across the industrial heartland.  The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s index for order backlogs, one of the best U.S. metrics for how quickly manufacturers are meeting demand, now stands at its highest level in 14 years. And many companies remain tight fisted. The Commerce Department recently reported that orders for capital goods, a key measure of business investment, fell in March, the third decline in four months. These numbers show that companies are holding back on spending, even as their order books swell.  \u201cWe\u2019re in a period of significant disruption where everyone is scrambling \u2014 but it\u2019s the way supply chains work today,\u201d said John Layden, a consultant in Indianapolis who helps companies design and manage supply networks.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  WHERE ARE THE WORKERS?  Finding employees is another drag on the U.S. manufacturing supply chain.  When Kirsh decided to add people early last year at his foundry - which melts iron and forms it into the rough shapes that will be refined for Caterpillar and others - he could not find them. Wisconsin\u2019s jobless rate has hit an all-time low of 2.8 percent.  So Kirsh tried something new, hiring a Minnesota staffing company that specializes in parachuting industrial workers into factories that can\u2019t find them locally.  He eventually got about 10 of these workers, who he calls \u201cmercenaries,\u201d who helped get his backlog under control. One came from as far as away as Detroit. But it was a costly fix. Between paying the staffing company, hotels and a per diem for the workers, he estimates they cost about three times more than local labor.  Industrial companies have always struggled with big swings in demand, but the problem of shortages emerges much quicker in today\u2019s super-lean economy.  In the past, manufacturers from Kirsh to Caterpillar often kept more goods on warehouse shelves, creating a built-in buffer that could be absorbed as signals went out to suppliers that the latest upturn is going to continue. That gave more time for everyone to gear up.  It is a luxury that does not exist anymore, said Joe Williams, president of privately-held Wolfe and Swickard Machine Company Inc. in Indianapolis, which buys forged parts from Kirsh and over 20 other foundries that his 85-worker shop shapes and polishes into final machine parts.  Early last year, Williams saw orders from Caterpillar surge 80 percent, a stunning increase that left him scrambling.  \u201cWhen we get an order, we have to order from a foundry, which has to communicate with the people supplying them metal, so there\u2019s always a lag,\u201d he said.  This time, however, it was particularly difficult. Some foundries simply refused his business because they were swamped with orders from other customers.  Like Kirsh, Williams has had trouble hiring workers and said he still needs at least 15 more machinists. Caterpillar has told him to expect orders to go up another 20 percent this year.

FILE PHOTO: Caterpillar machines are seen at Lianyungang port in Jiangsu province, China, January 21, 2018. Picture taken January 21, 2018. REUTERS\/Stringer\/File Photo  The Deerfield, Illinois-based company has boosted the full-year profit outlook twice in the first two quarters of this year. That had built hopes of yet another upgrade. But the company retained its 2018 adjusted profit forecast of $11.00 to $12.00 per share, saying nothing material had changed since the last revision in July.  The move came days after China reported the weakest economic growth since the global financial crisis, and the International Monetary Fund cut the global growth outlook for 2018 and 2019.  The industrial bellwether, however, said it expected the Chinese market to remain healthy, leading to a 40 percent annual increase in industry sales for standard full-size excavators this year.  \u201cWe are very comfortable with the outlook for China,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said in an interview. \u201cWe still expect to have another good year in China.\u201d  Bonfield said the world\u2019s second largest economy accounts for 10-15 percent of CAT\u2019s construction equipment sales and 5-10 percent of total company sales.  In the latest quarter, nonresidential building and infrastructure activities in China powered a 19 percent jump in Caterpillar\u2019s construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region.  Dealers in China posted one of the biggest inventory increases of Caterpillar products in the third quarter, the company said.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  A VICTIM OF HIGH EXPECTATIONS  The bullish comments helped Caterpillar shares recover from the worst sell-off since at least April, but the stock was still down 7 percent at $119.67 late Tuesday afternoon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, which includes Caterpillar, also pared early losses and was down 32.48 points.  \u201cMost investors are working with the base case scenario of a recession sometime in either 2019 or 2020,\u201d said Rizk Maidi, an analyst at equity research firm Berenberg in London. \u201cPeople are just hunting for any data point to confirm that the earnings have peaked.\u201d  Elizabeth Vermillion, an analyst at CFRA Research, said the company was also becoming a victim of high expectations after its profits topped Wall Street estimates in all of the last nine reporting periods.  For the third quarter, adjusted profit per share came in at $2.86, up from $1.95, last year. Analysts on average had expected $2.85 a share, according to Refinitiv.  OUTLOOK  Caterpillar shares are down over 25 percent since late January as U.S.-China trade tensions intensified and raw material and freight costs soared for local manufacturers. Shares of other major industrials, including 3M Co MMM.N, are also in \"bear market\" territory, down 20 percent or more from their highs.  CAT said most of its end markets are continuing to improve, helping it post higher sales across the three primary business segments.  Maidi said Caterpillar\u2019s earnings still have room to grow as its revenues are 25 percent off their 2012 peak.  On Tuesday, Bonfield asked investors to expect smaller profit increases.  \u201cThere does come a time when you grow at more normal levels,\u201d Bonfield said. Profit grew 47 percent in the third quarter, sharply lower than 99 percent and 120 percent jumps in the second and first quarter, respectively.  Caterpillar also acknowledged an increase in manufacturing costs in the latest quarter due to elevated freight costs, and higher steel prices and import tariffs.  It said tariffs would cost it about $40 million in the latest quarter. However, for the full year, it estimated the impact to be at the low end of the previous forecast of $100 million to $200 million.  To offset the rising input cost, it will raise prices of its machines and engines by 1 to 4 percent globally from January 2019.","99":"April 9 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc is in talks with banks to raise a new $3 billion nine-month revolving credit facility, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Illinois-based manufacturer of heavy machinery, a bellwether for economic activity, was hurt last year as business uncertainty prompted customers to delay capital spending, hitting sales of bulldozers, mining trucks and other equipment.  The company, which had pulled its guidance early in the pandemic, did not provide an earnings forecast for this year because of lingering economic uncertainty.  \u201cMarket conditions remain fluid due to the pandemic,\u201d Chief Executive Jim Umpleby said on an earnings call.  Still, he expects sales to be \u201cstronger\u201d this year due to a build-up in dealer inventory as well as improvements in the company\u2019s end-markets.  Caterpillar\u2019s optimism stems from increased residential activity in North America and a strong demand for construction machines in China.  U.S. homebuilding and permits have surged, underpinned by cheaper mortgages and an exodus from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas. Similarly, Beijing\u2019s infrastructure investment drive has lifted sales of construction machines in China, which accounts for up to 10% of Caterpillar\u2019s sales.  Higher commodity prices are encouraging miners to invest in new machinery.  Caterpillar\u2019s equipment sales fell across its three primary segments in the latest quarter, though the decline in retail sales slimmed to 2% in December from 17% in October.  Caterpillar\u2019s shares were up 2% at $188.4 in morning trade. They have gained over 22% since late October.  Umpleby said the company intends to revisit current pause in share repurchases later this year. Share repurchases were suspended last year following the pandemic-induced business turmoil.  The company also plans to recommend an increase in dividend payout this year, Umpleby said.  Adjusted profit came in at $2.12 per share, a 22% drop from a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv on average expected earnings to decline 45%.  The quarterly earnings were helped by lower costs and a lower tax rate.","101":"WASHINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The European Union is drafting a retaliatory tariff list that would target Caterpillar Inc, Xerox Corp and Samsonite International if U.S. President Donald Trump imposes duties on European cars, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing an unnamed senior EU official.

Shares of Caterpillar Inc and Nvidia Corp sank after the two manufacturers joined a growing list of companies warning about the crippling effects of the fall-off in growth in the world\u2019s most populous country.  Apple Inc, a host of chipmakers, and FedEx Corp had already stoked fears of a global slowdown, particularly in a technology sector that depends heavily on China to drive revenue.  It does not bode well, several analysts said, for the rest of an earnings season that has only just started. With fourth-quarter S&P 500 profit growth now estimated at 14.2 percent, expectations for the quarter remain down from Jan. 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The earnings risk from China \u201cis definitely something you need to brace for,\u201d said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.  \u201cAlthough some of these companies may meet earnings now, those forward-looking statements are really going to be where the gold, if you will, is. Are they really going to slash expectations everywhere?\u201d  China\u2019s economy cooled in the fourth quarter under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs, dragging 2018 growth to the lowest level in nearly three decades.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  President Donald Trump is bent on curbing what Washington says is Beijing\u2019s deliberate theft of American intellectual property and trade secrets. Without progress in the weeks ahead, he has threatened a new round of tariffs from March 2.  Tariffs remain a concern for many companies this reporting period. Whirlpool Corp cited tariffs as a drag on its North American business in its report after the bell. The company\u2019s stock fell in after-hours trading on a disappointing full-year forecast.  Monday\u2019s stock market declines, following an unusual warning from Apple earlier this month, underline the flip side of such moves for U.S. companies.  \u201cInvestors in general are at a point where they feel less certain about the earnings picture coming both this quarter and next quarter,\u201d said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey  Asia-Pacific was Caterpillar\u2019s only region to record a fall in revenue, and Nvidia cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars to just $2.2 billion. That added to a previous number that was already $700 million short of analysts\u2019 forecasts and was blamed chiefly on gaming revenue in China.  \u201cThe negative forecasts from Caterpillar and Nvidia really point to those areas of concern with trade, global economic activity and the potential impact of a strong dollar,\u201d said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.  There could be more pain in the coming days and weeks. Advanced Micro Devices Inc, due to report Tuesday, gets about a third of its revenue from China, based on Refinitiv\u2019s data, while Apple\u2019s results also are due Tuesday.  Wynn Resorts Ltd, scheduled to report Wednesday, gets more than 70 percent of its revenue from China. Also due Wednesday are Boeing Co, which derives roughly 13 percent of its revenue from China, and McDonald\u2019s Corp, with about 18 percent of its revenue from China.  The full-year earnings growth estimate for S&P 500 companies now stands at 5.6 percent versus 7.3 percent at the start of the month.  Technology\u2019s estimates have been among the hardest hit, and the sector\u2019s profit growth for 2019 is now estimated at just 1.5 percent, based on Refinitiv\u2019s data.  \u201cAcross the broad spectrum ranging from heavy equipment to semiconductors, business in China is slowing down,\u201d said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.  \u201cThe question is what does the tariff controversy factor into the slowdown.

FILE PHOTO: A Caterpillar corporate logo is pictured on a building in Peoria, Illinois, U.S., March 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri\/File Photo  The plant closures, which were announced internally over the past two months, were confirmed to Reuters by a company spokeswoman on Friday.  She said the move will affect its work tools facility in Waco, Texas, and its demonstration center in Panama.  The world\u2019s largest heavy-duty equipment maker emerged last year from the longest downturn in its history, when sales dropped more than 40 percent between 2012 and 2016.  The struggle led not only to a leadership change, but also resulted in a credit rating downgrade by Moody\u2019s.  Chastised by the sales slump, the Deerfield, Illinois-based company has embarked upon a restructuring strategy, looking to squeeze more production out of its existing factories, focusing on lean manufacturing, margin expansion and asset efficiency.  Separately, Caterpillar\u2019s Progress Rail unit is contemplating the closure of its engine manufacturing facility in LaGrange, Illinois, shifting the work to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and outside suppliers.  \u201cIf the LaGrange decision is finalized, the closure would impact approximately 600 full-time positions related directly to engine manufacturing,\u201d Caterpillar\u2019s spokeswoman said.  The plant closure news comes as some U.S. manufacturers are grappling with President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose import duties on steel and aluminum imports, which is expected to inflate input costs for equipment makers like Caterpillar.  The company\u2019s shares were up 1.6 percent at $156.99 on Friday afternoon.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  COST CUTS  Since 2013, Caterpillar has reduced its construction and energy and transportation assets by more than $4 billion.  The full-time workforce is smaller too. Even as a recovery in key markets is driving up production at its factories, Caterpillar is relying more on workers with flexible contracts to cater to the improving demand.  Caterpillar had 116,700 workers globally - including both fulltime and those with flexible contracts - at the end of last year.  Instead of investing in new factories, the company is spending money on expanding its services business and enhancing e-commerce capabilities.  The plan aims to eventually lift Caterpillar\u2019s adjusted operating margin to 14-17 percent when annual sales reach $55 billion. The company had sales of $45.5 billion in 2017.  Judging from recent results, the plan seems to be working. The adjusted operating margin swelled to nearly 14 percent last year, its highest level in at least 10 years, from 7 percent in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.  PLAYBOOK  In its focus on operating discipline, Caterpillar's restructuring program is similar to the strategy Deere & Co DE.N has pursued for nearly two decades as it seeks to boost returns for shareholders.  That discipline has stood the Moline, Illinois-based company in good stead, helping it sustain returns on capital and investment through varying economic cycles.  Caterpillar\u2019s director of investor relations, Amy Campbell, said earlier this week that the company would continue to look at structural costs reduction despite an improvement in sales volumes.  Caterpillar\u2019s workers were informed of the plans about the LaGrange and Panama facilities in January. The decision on the Waco facility was announced in late February.  The work at the Texas plant will be shifted to Wamego, Kansas, affecting 200 regular and contract positions, and the closure of the Panama facility will eliminate about 80 positions, the spokeswoman said.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The heavy machinery maker is looking to smooth volatility in its earnings by selling more parts and services, and said it intends to grow services revenue to $28 billion by 2026, up from $18 billion in 2018 and double what it was in 2016.  Deerfield, Illinois-based Caterpillar\u2019s main customers are in businesses like mining and construction, which are prone to wide swings with the business cycle.  \u201cServices will help dampen the impact of cycles, but we will never be immune from the cycle,\u201d Chief Executive Jim Umpleby said at an investor meeting at a Caterpillar equipment factory in Clayton, North Carolina.  Last week the company said about 850,000 of its machines are connected to the cloud, which it sees as a way to sell services to customers. That should grow to 1 million machines by year end, Bob De Lange, group president of services, distribution and digital, said on Thursday.  New Caterpillar machines are dotted with sensors that allow close monitoring and can warn when parts are about to fail.  Caterpillar makes most of its service income from selling spare parts, according to industry analysts. New digital offerings, such as monitoring services that help track the health of machines, are a small but growing revenue source.  Umpleby said the company\u2019s network of dealers, which it relies on to deliver and service machines, are participating in the services push and will also see added profits, though he declined to elaborate on that split. He emphasized, however, that the added revenue target for 2026 is for Caterpillar only.  The services business, spread across the company\u2019s construction, resource and energy & transportation units, contributed about 33 percent to Caterpillar\u2019s $54.7 billion revenue in 2018.  The company announced it will pay a dividend of $1.03 per share, up 20 percent from its previous payout, on Aug. 20 to shareholders at the close of business on July 22. It is targeting at least high single-digit dividend increases in each of the next four years and plans to buy back shares more consistently.  Last week, Caterpillar had spooked investors when it reported first-quarter results that showed rising costs hitting margins in its construction equipment business and weak sales in the Asia-Pacific region linked to slow growth in China.  Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said on Thursday that tariffs would cost the company $250 million to $350 million in 2019 if there was no relief.  Still, he said Caterpillar is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d there will be a resolution of the trade dispute with China.  Caterpillar has raised prices to offset some of the higher costs and pushed efficiency moves at its far-flung network of factories.  The company now has a target for adjusted operating margins of 3 to 6 percentage points above historical performance from 2010 to 2016.  Caterpillar shares ended down 2.2 percent on Thursday.","112":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc's CAT.N shares tumbled on Tuesday, giving up early gains on concerns that rising materials costs could squeeze profit margins for the heavy equipment manufacturer following U.S. President Donald Trump's crackdown on steel imports.  Those worries overshadowed its strong performance in the March quarter. Profits and revenues topped analysts\u2019 estimates, while the world\u2019s largest heavy equipment maker also upgraded its profit outlook for the full year 2018.  Yet investors grew concerned about management\u2019s comments that first-quarter performance was the \u201chigh watermark\u201d for the year. While Caterpillar expects earnings to be strong for the rest of 2018, the company cautioned it would not have the same pricing power to pass on increased material costs.  Caterpillar\u2019s shares opened higher on Tuesday and gained as much as 4.6 percent in early trade, buoyed the earnings outlook. The euphoria, however, did not even last two hours.  As soon as the company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Bradley M. Halverson called the first quarter profits \u201cthe high watermark for the year\u201d, the stock began giving up the gains. And when he started talking about the company\u2019s price versus material costs equation for the later parts of the year, the sell-off became more pronounced.  Shares in Caterpillar, part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, closed down 6.2 percent at $144.44 on the New York Stock Exchange. At one stage, the stock had lost 11 percent from the day's high.  \u201cIt\u2019s a negative surprise because the indications had previously been that everything was okay on that front,\u201d said Lawrence T. De Maria, co-group head of Global Industrial Infrastructure at William Blair & Company.  Caterpillar's slide exacerbated the fall in the broader market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI closed the day down 424.56 points, losing 1.74 percent from its close on Monday.  Tuesday\u2019s sell-off coincided with a rise in 10-year Treasury yields which hit the highly anticipated 3 percent mark for the first time in four years, stoking concerns over higher borrowing rates for companies already facing rising costs.  FILE PHOTO: New excavators are seen at a port in Yokohama, south of Tokyo February 10, 2011. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai\/File Photo  President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on steel imports has constrained supplies in the domestic market, inflating costs of the metal. Caterpillar said steel costs for the equipment industry were up about 15 percent in the March quarter.  To compensate, the company is carrying out price increases that would come into effect in the middle of the year.  Other companies also are relying on price increases to protect profit margins. Last week, Donaldson Company Inc DCI.N, which makes filters for heavy equipment makers, announced price increases of 4-15 percent, citing higher steel costs the company said were squeezing profit margins.  The Institute for Supply Management survey published this month showed a surge in the cost of raw materials and worries among manufacturers about the impact of Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum import tariffs.  The tariffs are pushing up steel prices at a time when inflation could be heating up, prompting the Federal Reserve to hike U.S. interest rates which could in turn slow economic growth and crimp domestic demand.  OUTLOOK REVISED UPWARD  The Deerfield, Illinois-based company now expects full-year profit to range between $9.75 to $10.75 per share, $2 above its range in January.  Caterpillar, which serves as a bellwether for global economic activity, has benefited as the global economy has had its best run since 2011. With the International Monetary Fund predicting robust global growth for the next two years, demand for its equipment is expected to remain strong.  In the latest quarter, revenues rose 31 percent on year to $12.9 billion, above Wall Street\u2019s expectations, as strong commodity prices and increased construction activities in North America and China drove up sales of mining and construction machines.  Overall sales were also boosted by favorable currency impacts and improved price realization.  \u201cThe first quarter was an exceptional quarter for performance,\u201d said Amy Campbell, head of investor relations at Caterpillar.  While she said the performance would not be repeated, the company still expected \u201cstrong\u201d operating margins for the full-year. Caterpillar also said it expected sales volume to grow thanks to higher demand across all regions and most end markets.  TRADE WORRIES  Caterpillar\u2019s 2018 forecast did not include potential impact from future geopolitical risks and increased trade restrictions. But in its annual report this year, the company warned that \u201cbuy national\u201d policies or retaliation against such policies could hurt operations.  Threats of a global trade war pose the biggest risks for a company that sells more than half of its machines outside the United States.  The company reported a net profit of $2.74 per share for the quarter, above analysts\u2019 consensus forecast of $2.04 per share. Adjusted net profit was $2.82 per share.","113":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Before William Barr became President Donald Trump\u2019s choice to lead the U.S. Department of Justice, he represented Caterpillar Inc, a Fortune 100 company, in a federal criminal investigation by the department.  FILE PHOTO: U.S. Attorney General William Barr meets with members of the St. Louis Police Department, in St. Louis, Missouri, U.S., October 15, 2020. Jeff Roberson\/Pool via REUTERS\/File Photo  Much was at stake for Caterpillar: Since 2018, the Internal Revenue Service has been demanding $2.3 billion in payments from the company in connection with the tax matters under criminal investigation. The company is contesting that finding.  A week after Barr was nominated for the job of attorney general, Justice officials in Washington told the investigative team in the active criminal probe of Caterpillar to take \u201cno further action\u201d in the case, according to an email written by one of the agents and reviewed by Reuters.  The decision, the email said, came from the Justice Department\u2019s Tax Division and the office of the deputy attorney general, who was then Rod Rosenstein.  \u201cI was instructed on December 13, 2018,\u201d wrote the agent, Jason LeBeau, \u201cthat the Tax Division and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General jointly came to the decision that no further action was to be taken on the matter until further notice.\u201d LeBeau, an inspector general agent at the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, declined interview requests from Reuters.  Since then, a source close to the case says, the investigation has \u201cstalled.\u201d The order to freeze the Caterpillar investigation has not been previously reported.  Reuters was unable to determine why Justice issued the \u201cno further action\u201d directive. It was not issued by Barr, as it came before he was confirmed. A Justice Department spokesperson said Barr recused himself from any Caterpillar discussions once he became attorney general, but declined further comment. Barr, in testimony during his confirmation hearings, said rules of legal privilege precluded him from discussing his work for the company.  Rosenstein, who left the government in May 2019, did not respond to a phone message and emails seeking comment. The IRS declined to comment about the case.  Caterpillar, for its part, has reported to investors that the grand jury investigation is ongoing. The company told Reuters the DOJ\u2019s Tax Division is reviewing the investigation. Caterpillar has said for years that it did nothing wrong.  Potential conflicts of interest, whether real or apparent, often arise when high-powered lawyers switch between private practice and government service. Bruce A. Green, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at Fordham Law School, said it is not unheard of for attorney generals to have clients who had business before the DOJ. He noted that in 2009, President Barack Obama\u2019s attorney general, Eric Holder, recused himself from a case involving Swiss Bank UBS, a prior client.  But Green said he could not recall a case where agents were told to take no further action on a matter involving an incoming attorney general\u2019s former client without some kind of explanation. \u201cWhy would you just stop?\u201d he asked.  A source familiar with the progress of the investigation, which is being conducted out of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of Illinois, said that since December 2018, \u201cit\u2019s slowed, it\u2019s stalled, it\u2019s languishing. Not a lot of action is being taken.\u201d But the source stressed the probe is not technically closed, and couldn\u2019t be called \u201cdead.\u201d  The government\u2019s questions about Caterpillar\u2019s tax structure started with a whistleblower lawsuit in 2009 that laid out what it said was a complex \u201ctax dodge\u201d to route Caterpillar profits on parts sales through a company in Switzerland. Then, in 2014, the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations dug into the issue, and alleged the company adopted a sales strategy that \u201cshifted billions of dollars in profits away from the United States and into Switzerland, where Caterpillar had negotiated an effective corporate tax rate of 4% to 6%.\u201d The Senate investigators quoted company insiders who said the system was structured for \u201ctax avoidance.\u201d  At the time, Caterpillar said the transactions, and tax strategy, were entirely legal. A Caterpillar vice president testified to the committee that having an offshore subsidiary collect profits and pay taxes was \u201cnothing more than the standard business operations and tax planning that any prudent multinational enterprise would employ.\u201d  The next year, a federal grand jury in Illinois launched a criminal investigation. In March 2017, federal agents raided three Caterpillar offices, wheeling out evidence in large black plastic boxes. In a report written for the government, a consultant for the investigators, Leslie Robinson, called the tax strategy \u201cfraudulent rather than negligent.\u201d  Two weeks after the raid, Caterpillar Chief Executive Jim Umpleby announced the hiring of Barr as company counsel. Barr would \u201ctake a fresh look at Caterpillar\u2019s disputes with the government, get all the facts, and then help us bring these matters to proper resolution based on the merits.\u201d  Robinson, the investigative consultant who had questioned Caterpillar\u2019s tactics, told Reuters she met with Barr in May 2017, briefing him on why she thought the tax strategy was illegal, and to hear why the company thought it was not. Robinson said she would not discuss the meeting details or the basis for her conclusion in the government\u2019s report.  In November 2018, as the White House scanned potential lawyers to take the job of attorney general, Barr\u2019s name was among those floated. On December 7, the White House announced his selection. \u201cHe was my first choice from day one,\u201d Trump said. Barr has emerged as one of Trump\u2019s most aggressive aides, most recently authorizing federal prosecutors to investigate the counting of votes in this month\u2019s presidential election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden.  In January 2019, Robinson, a professor at Dartmouth College\u2019s Tuck School of Business, sent a note to FDIC agent LeBeau asking if the case was \u201cdead or progressing.\u201d Robinson wrote, \u201cFrom a personal standpoint, it is a bit peculiar to have spent so much of my time and energy on something and then to have no idea if it will amount to anything concrete.\u201d  \u201cQuite frankly I am somewhat in the dark as well,\u201d LeBeau replied. He said he had understood that a new U.S. attorney was in discussions with Caterpillar, but knew little more. \u201cI know the process is going incredibly slow.\u201d  This October, Robinson communicated again with the investigators. In emails reviewed by Reuters, she asked what had happened to the case, explaining that a Reuters reporter had inquired. That\u2019s when LeBeau explained, copying other agents and a prosecutor on the email, that they had been told to take no further action a week after Barr\u2019s nomination 20 months ago.  \u201cWe were given no additional explanation,\u201d he wrote."}}
