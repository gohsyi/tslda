In June, the Justice Department indicted Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Chief Executive Jayson Penn and three others in its first charges in the criminal probe involving broiler birds, which account for most U.S. chicken.  Court documents filed on Tuesday show former Pilgrim\u2019s Pride CEO William Lovette has also been indicted. Lovette could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, and a company spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.  The indictments come after grocers, retailers and consumers filed a lawsuit accusing Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, Tyson Foods and other poultry processors of conspiring to inflate prices for broiler chickens.  \u201cExecutives who choose collusion over competition will be held to account for schemes that cheat consumers and corrupt our competitive markets,\u201d Makan Delrahim, chief of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division, said in a statement on Wednesday.  Penn, who succeeded Lovette as CEO in 2019, has pleaded not guilty.  Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, mostly owned by Brazil-based meatpacker JBS SA, last month said Penn left the company and was replaced as CEO by Chief Financial Officer Fabio Sandri.  The court documents allege industry executives conspired to fix chicken prices from 2012 through 2019.  Also indicted was sales executive Timothy Mulrenin.  Mulrenin, who was hired by Perdue Farms in 2018, worked at Tyson Foods at the time of the allegations outlined against him in court documents, according to the filing and his LinkedIn page. He did not immediately respond to a message sent through LinkedIn.  Perdue declined to comment.  Tyson in June said it was cooperating with the Justice Department\u2019s investigation under a corporate leniency program that could protect the company from criminal prosecution.  The latest indictment does not affect Tyson\u2019s status in its leniency application, spokesman Gary Mickelson said.","1":"June 2 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc:  * TYSON FOODS, INC SAYS RELEASES RESULTS FROM COVID-19 TESTING AT COUNCIL BLUFFS, IA PLANT  * TYSON FOODS INC SAYS OF 1,483 TEAM MEMBERS WHO WORK AT FACILITY AND WERE TESTED, 224 TESTED POSITIVE Source: bit.ly\/3cqX3Sp Further company coverage:","2":"FILE PHOTO: Traders gather at the post that trades Tyson Foods on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange June 3, 2014. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  CHICAGO (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc TSN.N said on Thursday it will temporarily close an Iowa pork plant due to the coronavirus pandemic, a month after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered slaughterhouses to stay open to protect the country's food supply.  Meat processors like Tyson Foods, WH Group's 0288.HK Smithfield Foods and JBS USA temporarily closed about 20 slaughterhouses last month as workers fell ill with the new coronavirus, leading to shortages of certain products in grocery stores. Production remains lower than normal because of increased absenteeism and social distancing among employees.  An Iowa state official said 555 employees at Tyson\u2019s Storm Lake plant tested positive for the virus, about 22% of the workforce.  Tyson will stop slaughtering hogs at the facility and finish processing the animals over the next two days, according to a statement.  It will resume operations next week following \u201cadditional deep cleaning and sanitizing of the entire facility,\u201d the statement said. The closure is due partly to a delay in COVID-19 testing results and employee absences, according to Tyson.  Tyson said it conducted large-scale COVID-19 testing at the plant in northwestern Iowa and implemented safety measures to protect employees like requiring them to wear masks.  The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union called on the Trump administration and meat companies to do more to protect workers. The union reported more than 3,000 infections and 44 deaths among U.S. meatpacking workers, up from 35 deaths as of May 12.  \u201cToo many workers are being sent back into meatpacking plants without adequate protections in place, reigniting more outbreaks in the plants and our communities,\u201d said Nick Nemec, a South Dakota farmer who is part of an advocacy group working with the union.  The Storm Lake plant slaughters about 17,250 pigs a day when it is running at full capacity, according to industry data. That accounted for about 3.5% of U.S. production before the pandemic.","3":"CHICAGO, Sept 15 (Reuters) - China has blocked imports from an OK Foods poultry plant in Fort Smith, Arkansas, because of coronavirus cases among workers, the president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council said on Tuesday.

China is still working its way through frozen meat supplies, but could begin to increase imports of U.S. pork to fill a shortfall as soon as October, he said.  Shares hit a record high of $87.27.  African swine fever is fatal to pigs but harmless to humans and has not been found in the United States.

That could help Tyson, which produces beef and chicken as well as pork.  \u201cI think that all of the proteins will benefit,\u201d White told analysts on a conference call.  Tyson has already held discussions with meat buyers in China, the world\u2019s largest hog producer and pork consumer, White said.  But China\u2019s purchases so far have fallen short of industry expectations so far after Beijing last year imposed retaliatory duties on imports of American farm products including pork as part of the escalating U.S.-China trade war.  \u201cAs China depletes its frozen inventory and starts tapping into the global pork supply in a more meaningful way, we expect Tyson to start realizing meaningful upside, likely in early FY20,\u201d Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said.

The size of the American crop is uncertain after farmers suffered unprecedented plantings delays this spring due to widespread flooding.  Tyson expects a year-over-year increase of $150 million to $200 million in the cost of grain, Chief Financial Officer Stewart Glendinning said.  The company recorded a $40 million gain in its chicken unit in the third quarter ended June 29 as corn futures rose, benefiting the company\u2019s position in the grain market. However, much of that profit is likely to be reversed in the fourth quarter as corn prices have pulled back, Glendinning said.  Net income attributable to Tyson rose to $676 million, or $1.84 per share, in the quarter, from $541 million, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier.

The son of a worker at a Tyson facility in Waterloo, Iowa, who died in April of complications from the virus, filed a lawsuit that claims plant managers misled workers about COVID-19 and allowed sick employees to continue working.  The worker, Isidro Fernandez, got sick because of his job, according to the lawsuit that was amended on Nov. 11.  The Waterloo facility is Tyson\u2019s largest U.S. pork plant, processing 19,500 hogs a day, or about 5% of total U.S. pork production.  COVID-19 infected more than 1,000 employees out of about 2,800 at the plant, and five died, the lawsuit says. Tyson idled the plant in late April because of an outbreak.  Earlier that month, manager Tom Hart \u201corganized a cash buy-in, winner-take-all betting pool for supervisors and managers to wager how many employees would test positive for COVID-19,\u201d according to the lawsuit.

Tyson reported lower-than-expected earnings and revenue for the quarter ended on March 28, before processors shut massive slaughterhouses as the respiratory illness spread among workers. Shares fell more than 8% as Tyson also said meat sales will fall in the second half of the year because the outbreak has reduced restaurant demand.  Trump last week deemed meatpacking plants \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d that must stay open, in an executive order to protect the nation\u2019s food supply.  \u201cThere have been some shortages in some specific categories,\u201d Chief Executive Noel White told analysts on a conference call.  Tyson is working with government officials to resume operations at a massive beef plant it closed in Dakota City, Nebraska, White said. The company over the weekend was receiving results for COVID-19 tests it performed on employees of another shuttered beef plant in Pasco, Washington, he said.  Tyson also temporarily closed Iowa pork plants in Waterloo and Perry, and said on Friday it would re-open a pork plant in Logansport, Indiana.  When plants reopen, it is unknown how employees many will immediately return to work amid fears about the virus. One worker at Tyson\u2019s Waterloo facility told Reuters he planned to take three weeks of vacation time to stay away.

Retail demand for Tyson\u2019s meat has increased 30-40% as consumers stay home, but the company said sales will decline in the second half of the year because of lost foodservice and restaurant business.  Costco Wholesale Corp and Kroger Co have limited meat purchases.  Tyson warned prior to Trump\u2019s order that millions of pounds of beef, pork and chicken would vanish from U.S. grocery stores because of plant shutdowns.

Tyson is betting that meat eaters wanting healthier diets will see their blend as offering a meat taste and vegetable health.  It joins other food companies vying for a share of the U.S. alternative meat market which analysts estimate to be worth $100 billion by 2035 as consumers seek to reduce meat consumption amid growing concerns over health risks and environmental hazards of industrial animal farming.  Tyson will sell blended protein burgers made from beef and pea protein, and sausages and meatballs that combine chicken with plants including chickpeas, black beans and quinoa, the company said in a statement. It also will offer vegetarian nuggets.  California upstarts Beyond Meat Inc and Impossible Foods Inc each sell 100% plant-based meat alternatives to retailers and fast food chains across the United States.  Tyson sold its 6.5% stake in Beyond Meat in late April, just days before the company went public, to focus on the development of its own plant-based products.  Tyson shares were up around 1 percent at $82.65, while those of Beyond Meat were down 4.4 percent at $135.68.  Tyson\u2019s plant-centered products, under its new Raised & Rooted brand, will be sold through its customers, sales outlets and foodservice operators, Justin Whitmore, head of Tyson\u2019s alternative protein business, said in an interview, declining to elaborate.  The largest U.S. meat processor, known for its Ball Park hot dogs and Jimmy Dean sausages, will launch the nuggets in the summer and the blended burgers in the fall.  Whitmore said it was too early to estimate revenues, calling Tyson\u2019s plant-based business highly incremental, but he noted that could change.  \u201cThe double-digit growth in the sector is largely driven by meat eaters who want the health and nutrition that they perceive to come from plants along with the taste they\u2019ve always had from animal protein,\u201d Whitmore said, adding that the company was working on additional plant-based products.  Analysts at Mizuho Securities USA cast doubt on the company\u2019s blended protein approach.  \u201cWe\u2019re less confident in blended meat\/plant products as we believe in the early stages of alternative meat, consumers want to make a simple binary decision between eating meat or not,\u201d the analysts said in a note.  Tyson Chief Executive Noel White said in a statement the company remained firmly committed to expanding its traditional meat business, but is shifting toward becoming a protein company.  Other companies following a similar path include Canadian packaged meat producer Maple Leaf Foods Inc, whose vegan \u201cground beef\u201d and burger patties, sold under its LightLife brand, will be on U.S. store shelves this summer.  Nestle, the world\u2019s biggest packaged foods group, is aiming to sell a pea-based veggie patty called Awesome Burger under its U.S. plant-based Sweet Earth brand in the fall.","14":"June 2 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc:  * TYSON FOODS INC SAYS RELEASES RESULTS FROM COVID-19 TESTING AT STORM LAKE, IA PLANT  * TYSON FOODS INC SAYS OF 2,303 TEAM MEMBERS WHO WORK AT FACILITY AND WERE TESTED, 591 TESTED POSITIVE Source: bit.ly\/2AxLTOm Further company coverage:","15":"(Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter sales on Thursday as the largest U.S. meat processor was stung by weaker pork prices and sales volumes and lower chicken prices.

Tyson is grappling with a drop in U.S. demand for chicken and declining prices for pork due to trade tensions between the United States and some trading partners.  Top pork importers Mexico and China have both raised tariffs on U.S. pork shipments in retaliation for higher U.S. duties on their goods, leading to a glut of meat in the United States.

With African swine fever in China, the world\u2019s top hog producer, about 5 percent of the global protein supply has disappeared, Tyson Chief Executive Noel White said. China is expected to import more protein to make up for herd losses, which White estimated at 150 million to 200 million pigs.  The deaths could help Tyson by pushing up pork prices and prompting consumers to buy more chicken and beef as alternatives, White said.  \u201cAfrican swine fever has the potential to impact the global protein industry on a level that we have never experienced,\u201d he said.  Tyson shares were up 2.7 percent at $77.08 in afternoon trading and reached their highest price since February 2018.  Tyson could start benefiting from the disease outbreaks late this fiscal year, White said. So far, though, U.S. hog prices have climbed faster than those for pork on expectations for increased Chinese demand, hurting processors\u2019 margins.  White said there was a distinct possibility African swine fever could enter the United States, which would threaten trade and herds.  African swine fever COULD ALSO HURT Tyson by raising input costs for pork the company uses in prepared food products.  Tyson tempered an annual outlook for its prepared foods unit to a range of 10 percent to 12 percent return on sales. The company was previously expecting closer to 12 percent, White said.  Tyson plans to raise prices for prepared foods over the next six months to compensate for more expensive raw materials, White said. He said higher meat costs will reduce demand among some consumers.  \u201cWe do not yet understand how pork and prepared food margins will be anything but impaired under the weight of higher hog costs,\u201d J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.  Profits in the quarter ended March 30 benefited from higher sales in Tyson\u2019s beef and prepared foods segments.  Excluding certain items, Tyson earned $1.20 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.14 per share. Quarterly sales were $10.44 billion, above expectations for $10.29 billion.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The biggest U.S. meat company by sales expects demand will improve as COVID-19 vaccinations prompt people to eat out more often. So far, though, increased meat sales at grocery stores have not been enough to offset the decline at food-service businesses.  Shares were last down about 5.6% at $65.40.  Tyson\u2019s total quarterly sales volumes dropped 4.4% from a year earlier, including a 7% decline in chicken, according to the company. It faces additional challenges from surging costs for corn and soy, which are used for animal feed, and from a shortage of truck drivers, executives said.  U.S. corn futures this week reached their highest price since June 2013 as strong export demand is expected to drain U.S. stockpiles to the smallest in seven years.  \u201cThe change in pricing in grains has been nothing less than enormous, and that is going to weigh on the business,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Stewart Glendinning told analysts on a call.  Higher chicken and pork prices helped offset declines in sales volumes, according to Tyson. Overall sales fell about 3% to $10.46 billion in the quarter, missing a Refinitiv IBES estimate of $10.84 billion.  Net income attributable to Tyson fell nearly 8% to $467 million, or $1.28 per share, in the three months ended Jan. 2.

Its chicken plants are still struggling with labor, Glendinning said, after COVID-19 outbreaks temporarily shut some U.S. slaughterhouses last spring.  \u201cHigher levels of absenteeism and turnover have created inefficiency in our operations,\u201d Glendinning said. \u201cThey leave us short of team members to fully staff our plants and also drive higher levels of overtime pay.\u201d","20":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. pork prices rose in recent weeks at a time when they would normally be falling, as a fatal pig disease in China is tightening global meat supplies, the chief executive of Tyson Foods Inc said on Tuesday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The price increase is probably the first time African swine fever (ASF) has significantly affected the United States, CEO Noel White said, after the company posted lower-than-expected quarterly earnings.  The increase is \u201cextremely unusual,\u201d White told analysts on a conference call, because prices usually drop in the autumn. The United States also has more hogs than ever. Processors are slaughtering about 2.7 million pigs per week, up from about 2.6 million a year ago.  But African swine fever is reshaping global meat markets and China is scouring the world to replace millions of its pigs killed by the disease.  Higher U.S. pork prices could benefit meatpackers like Arkansas-based Tyson, though they were overshadowed in the company\u2019s latest earnings by an August fire at a U.S. beef plant. Reduced international supplies are also expected to help Tyson rivals like Seaboard Corp, JBS USA and WH Group\u2019s Smithfield Foods.  \u201cSince the product is being produced for export today, we are seeing product prices move higher,\u201d White said.  Tyson shares climbed more than 6% after his comments.  \u201cWe urge investors to buy here before the impact of ASF is felt,\u201d Bernstein analysts said in a note.  African swine fever has killed up to half of China\u2019s hog herd since August 2018 and lifted Chinese pork prices to record highs. Vietnam, the Philippines and other nations are also struggling with outbreaks.  U.S. processors face a disadvantage for sales to China, compared with other suppliers, because Beijing imposed steep tariffs on U.S. pork as part of the countries\u2019 trade war. Still, Chinese prices are so high that importers are willing to pay the tariff, affecting the U.S. market.  From January to September, U.S. pork exports to China and Hong Kong were up 47% in volume from a year earlier. Chicago Mercantile Exchange December lean hog futures have risen about 12% since hitting a one-year low in September.  \u201cChina has already taken a lot of product,\u201d said Steve Meyer, economist for Kerns and Associates. \u201cThey\u2019re going to take more and more.\u201d  Tyson fell short of Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue and profit, after the slaughterhouse fire hurt sales volumes in its beef business, the company\u2019s biggest segment.

Tyson said the changes would improve food safety and efficiency, though some activists worried they could result in less oversight.  The country\u2019s highest-selling meat supplier asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in March 2019 for a waiver from inspection requirements at its plant in Holcomb, Kansas. Other companies have made similar changes at chicken and pork plants.  The USDA granted the waiver in March 2020, allowing Tyson workers instead of government inspectors to check cattle carcasses for blood clots, bruises or signs of disease before the animals are butchered, company executives said.  The pandemic delayed the changes, but Tyson will now hire 15 people per shift to check carcasses, said the company, which worked with Iowa State University to develop training materials for workers.  The number of USDA inspectors at the plant will drop to nine per shift from 17, the agency said in a statement to Reuters. The number of highly trained government employees who do more complex work like monitoring animal welfare or meat testing will increase to seven per shift from two, according to USDA.  Tyson aims to eventually use cameras and computer imaging to evaluate the carcasses, said Jennifer Williams, vice president of food safety.  \u201cThis is a way to leverage new technology and plant employees to implement these steps, that will free up some inspectors to focus on improving public health, animal welfare and food safety,\u201d said James Roth, director of Iowa State\u2019s Center for Food Security and Public Health.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The halt in the use of the drug, ractopamine, reflects a change in strategy for Tyson, company watchers say. The company previously sought to profit by filling holes in U.S. supplies that were left when industry rivals like Smithfield Foods and JBS USA sent American pork to China.  Now, Tyson, Smithfield and JBS - the top three U.S. pork processors - are vying for business in China, the world\u2019s biggest pork consumer, where an outbreak of African swine fever has devastated the hog herd, pushed pork prices to record highs and sent imports rocketing. Though not harmful to humans, the disease is deadly to pigs, with no vaccine available.  But U.S. companies have to cope with a significant handicap compared to suppliers based elsewhere. Beijing has imposed tariffs on imports of U.S. pork due to the long-running trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.  \u201cOf course it\u2019s all to pave the way to get ready to start shipping very large amounts of pork to China,\u201d said Dennis Smith, a commodity broker for Archer Financial Services in Chicago.  Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat producer, is \u201cthe last shoe to drop,\u201d said Smith, who said he learned of the policy change from a farmer. The company already generates almost $1 billion in pork export sales annually.  \u201cWe believe the move to prohibit ractopamine use will allow Tyson Fresh Meats and the farmers who supply us to compete more effectively for export opportunities in even more countries,\u201d Steve Stouffer, president of Tyson Fresh Meats, said in a statement.  China\u2019s pork imports climbed 76% in September from a year earlier with African swine fever having decimated its domestic hog herd, according to Chinese government data.  The disease surfaced more than a year ago in China - the first time it had been detected in Asia - and has since spread to more than 50 countries, according to the World Organization of Animal Health, including those accounting for 75% of global pork production.  Chinese authorities blocked the use of ractopamine in livestock in 2002 over health concerns, and the European Union also prohibits the drug. The United States and other countries say it can be safely used to add lean muscle to pigs.  Tyson previously offered a small amount of ractopamine-free pork to export customers by working with farmers who raise hogs without the feed additive. Those programs \u201cno longer adequately meet growing global demand,\u201d Tyson said.  Tyson\u2019s share price was down 1.3 percent at $80.80 in Thursday morning trade.  JBS USA, owned by Brazil\u2019s JBS SA, said this month it would remove ractopamine from its hog supply chain.  Smithfield, owned by China\u2019s WH Group, raises pigs on company-owned and contract farms without the drug, but still processes pigs from other farmers who use ractopamine.  Elanco Animal Health manufactures a ractopamine feed ingredient under the brand name \u2018Paylean\u2019.  \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in any decision that would take safe, proven technology out of the hands of farmers,\u201d Elanco spokeswoman Keri McGrath said in a statement Thursday.","32":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc received approval from U.S. and Chinese authorities to export American poultry to China from all 36 of its U.S. processing plants and expects to begin taking orders early next year, a chief supply chain officer for the company said.

A deadly hog disease has killed millions of pigs and raised meat prices in the pork-loving country.

The U.S. Trade Representative last month projected more than $1 billion in annual poultry shipments to China.  Beijing banned U.S. poultry and eggs in January 2015 over a U.S. outbreak of avian flu, closing a market that bought $500 million worth of American poultry products in 2013, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).  China is scouring the globe for meat and poultry after African swine fever killed about half of the world\u2019s largest hog herd.  U.S. meat companies have faced a disadvantage for pork exports to China, compared to other suppliers, because Beijing imposed tariffs of up to 72% on American pork as part of the countries\u2019 trade war. Tyson, the largest U.S. meat producer, expects China to import more U.S. pork and poultry to compensate for African swine fever\u2019s toll.  \u201cMy gut is they\u2019re going to buy a lot of both,\u201d Adcock said.  China is an important market for chicken parts that many U.S. consumers do not eat. During China\u2019s ban, companies including Tyson and Sanderson Farms Inc rendered some feet for products like fertilizer and pet food, instead of exporting them for higher returns.  Tyson is working to win U.S. approval by the end of the year for labels on poultry exported to China, the final step. It received its first label approval on Friday, Adcock said.  Processing plants run by Sanderson, Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp and other companies also have been cleared to ship U.S. poultry to China, according to USDA.

Tyson, like other U.S. meat processing and packaged food companies, has been facing higher transportation costs as railroads and truck fleets have raised prices amid a shortage of drivers, reduced capacity, higher fuel prices and a strengthening U.S. economy.  The rise in freight costs had a net effect of about 14 cents per share for the quarter, with a full-year estimated impact of roughly $250 million, up from the first-quarter estimate of $200 million, Tyson Chief Executive Tom Hayes said on a conference call.  \u201cWhile we were climbing the hill, the grade steepened,\u201d said Hayes.

Hayes said the company was not significantly affected by the 25 percent additional tariff on U.S. pork imposed by China in early April in response to higher duties by Washington on Chinese steel and aluminum.  Tyson sells less than 0.5 percent in total pork sales to China; in 2017 that was about $150 million, said Hayes.  From January through March 2018 total U.S. pork exports to China\/Hong Kong declined 15 percent from the same period last year to 111,681 tonnes valued at $260.7 million, due to rising Chinese production and falling hog prices, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF).  China\u2019s additional 25 percent tariff on U.S. pork imposed in early April was not reflected in the 2018 first-quarter results, the USMEF said.  The maker of Ball Park hotdogs and Jimmy Dean sausages is also facing higher feed costs as prices of commodities like soybean and corn increase. It expects chicken feed costs to rise by about $100 million in fiscal 2018.

The 104-page complaint by the Ranchers Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America (R-CALF) and four cattle-feeding ranchers was filed in Chicago federal court, and seeks compensatory, punitive and triple damages.  It resembles litigation in the same court in which companies, including Tyson and JBS, have been accused of conspiring to fix prices of broiler chickens and pork.  Tyson said the lawsuit was \u201cbaseless,\u201d and that as in the chicken and pork lawsuits there was no merit to the claim it colluded. \u201cTyson wants its suppliers to succeed,\u201d it added.  The other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  According to the complaint, Tyson, Cargill, JBS and National Beef conspired to suppress prices through such tactics as importing foreign cattle at a loss, closing slaughter plants, and reducing slaughter and purchase volumes.  The conspiracy \u201cencouraged an apprehension amongst producers that they might not be able to \u2018get their cattle dead\u2019\u201d unless prices were cut, and led to an artificial 7.9 percent average reduction in fed cattle prices, the complaint said.  Tyson, Cargill, JBS and National Beef controlled more than 81 percent of the market for U.S. fed cattle in 2017, with more than $48 billion of beef sales in that fiscal year, the complaint said.  The lawsuit is meant to \u201cprevent the Big 4 packers from capturing the U.S. cattle market from independent U.S. cattle producers,\u201d R-CALF Chief Executive Bill Bullard said in a statement provided by the group\u2019s lawyers. \u201cWe hope U.S. cattle ranchers can be compensated for years of significant losses.\u201d  The case is Ranchers Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America et al v Tyson Foods Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 19-02726.","43":"May 4 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc said on Monday it expects meat sales volume to fall in the second half of this year, as restaurants are being forced to operate at a limited capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The lawsuit claimed that plant managers misled workers about COVID-19, bet on workers catching the virus and allowed sick employees to continue working.  Tyson in November suspended the employees accused of wagering at the Waterloo facility - its largest U.S. pork plant.

REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri\/File Photo  Tyson said Banks will replace 37-year company veteran Noel White in October as it reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales. The company predicted the pandemic will increase operating costs and hinder sales volumes into next year.  Uncertainty over the economic reopening confronts Banks, who formerly worked for Google-parent Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O experimental research division. He joined Tyson's board in 2017 and became president in December 2019.  Chairman John Tyson said Banks will help the company integrate more technology into operations and focus on employee health.  The novel coronavirus has infected thousands of U.S. meatpacking workers and led to temporary meat shortages as processors closed slaughterhouses in April and May. Plants have reopened, but absences among workers who are afraid of getting sick continue to limit output.  Tyson said it spent $340 million on COVID-19 testing, personal protective equipment and other direct costs related to the disease. The company has tested about 40,000 employees, one-third of its workforce, and less than 1% are currently infected, White said.  Grocery-store sales have spiked during the pandemic, but Tyson said it is grappling with a larger drop in demand from food-service outlets. The company predicted lower sales volumes in its chicken and prepared foods segments in the last fiscal quarter.  In the third quarter ended June 27, Tyson\u2019s chicken unit swung to an adjusted operating loss of $120 million from income of $237 million a year earlier.  \u201cOur level of future growth is dependent on away-from-home eating occasions, which will be impacted by communities opening up and potentially reclosing,\u201d White told analysts.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  The company said the plant would be down \u201cindefinitely\u201d after the Friday night fire, which idled some 3,800 workers.  Tyson\u2019s stock price recovered from an early drop and was trading near unchanged around midday, after setting a record high on Friday. The stock has climbed more than 60% this year, partly on strong demand for beef, the largest segment of Tyson\u2019s business by sales.  The company plans to rebuild the damaged beef plant in Holcomb, Kansas, but said it did not know when the facility would reopen.  \u201cWe will use other plants within our network to help keep our supply chain full,\u201d said Steve Stouffer, group president of Tyson Fresh Meats.  There were no casualties reported due to the fire, the cause of which was still being investigated.  The plant processed about 6,000 cattle per day, representing around 5% of the total industry and a bit over 20% of Tyson\u2019s capacity, J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said. He estimated the plant will be shut for months and that the closure could hurt Tyson\u2019s fiscal 2019 earnings per share by as much as 50 cents.  The halt in slaughtering pushed Chicago Mercantile Exchange cattle futures down by their daily, exchange-imposed 3-cent limit as traders expect cattle supplies may start to back up in feedlots. October cattle futures were down 3 cents at 103.750 cents per pound  Lower cattle prices could benefit other meat companies, which will see a larger supply while Tyson\u2019s plant is closed, said Dennis Smith, broker for Archer Financial Services. Tyson competes with packers like Cargill and JBS USA.  \u201cThe packers are going to use the leverage to their full advantage, and they\u2019re going to lower the cash steer market,\u201d Smith said.  Tyson\u2019s beef business produced a record operating margin of 6.1% in the first nine months of its fiscal year, up from 5.8% a year earlier. The company projects margins will reach 7% for the full year and be similar or higher in 2020 as supplies of cattle are ample.  In the quarter ended June 29, the beef unit recorded sales of $4.2 billion. Sales volumes and prices rose from a year earlier.","49":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Tyson Foods TSN.N said on Tuesday it plans in January to have company employees take on duties from more than a dozen federal inspectors at a large Kansas beef plant, after getting a U.S. government waiver.  FILE PHOTO: The exterior of the Tyson Fresh Meats processing plant is seen in the Finney County town of Holcomb, Kansas, U.S. August 12, 2019. REUTERS\/Adam Shrimplin  Tyson said the change would improve food safety and efficiency as part of a process to modernize inspections, although activists worried it could result in less oversight.  The country\u2019s highest-selling meat supplier asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in March 2019 for a waiver from inspection requirements at its plant in Holcomb, Kansas. Other companies have made similar changes at chicken and pork plants.  The USDA granted the waiver in March 2020, allowing Tyson workers instead of government inspectors to check cattle carcasses for defects or disease before the animals are butchered, company executives said.  The USDA said in a statement to Reuters that it will continue to inspect all carcasses and parts, while shifting \u201cquality assurance and trimming tasks\u201d to Tyson.  The pandemic delayed the changes, but Tyson will now hire 15 people per shift to check carcasses, according to the company, which worked with Iowa State University to develop training materials for workers.  The total number of USDA inspectors at the plant will drop, although there will be more highly trained inspectors who do more complex work like monitoring animal welfare or meat testing, according to the agency.  Tyson aims to eventually use cameras and computer imaging to evaluate carcasses, said Jennifer Williams, vice president of food safety.  \u201cThis is a way to leverage new technology and plant employees to implement these steps, that will free up some inspectors to focus on improving public health, animal welfare and food safety,\u201d said James Roth, director of Iowa State\u2019s Center for Food Security and Public Health.  Meatpackers accelerated automation after COVID-19 infected thousands of slaughterhouse employees. USDA inspectors were also infected.  Activists said the inspection changes were a move toward deregulation.  \u201cIt\u2019s really problematic,\u201d said Zach Corrigan, a Food & Water Watch senior staff attorney.","50":"(Adds Tyson statement)  CHICAGO, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Ships carrying refrigerated cargo containers of chicken from the United States to China are being diverted to ports in Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to a U.S. poultry export trade group.  The virus, which is causing havoc in the global container shipping trade, is keeping consumers and workers at home in China, delaying purchases at stores and restaurants and slowing the unloading of products at ports.  Chinese ports have run out of space for refrigerated containers, which must be plugged into electrical outlets once they are offloaded to keep frozen meat and other food products cold, Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, told Reuters on Thursday.  Frozen and refrigerated product is starting to spoil because of the lack of available power, a manager for a Los Angeles port terminal operator said.  The delays come as China was poised to increase U.S. beef and poultry imports after the Phase 1 trade deal announced last month.  U.S. poultry exporters are being told by freight, port and government officials that shipments of medical supplies and pork needed to bolster China\u2019s reserves are being allowed in, Sumner said.  \u201cEverything else is being considered not a priority and is not allowed entry,\u201d he said. \u201cChina is basically shut down right now.\u201d  Tyson Foods has not redirected any of its current chicken products from their intended destinations, and has restarted all its operations, the company said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe are actively assessing what this outbreak may mean for our global business and preparing for the possibility of any impact.\u201d  Maryland-based Perdue Farms Inc told Reuters that it does have orders on the books and is monitoring the ports situation.  An estimated 300 to 400 refrigerated poultry containers - currently in transit - are being diverted. About 80% of the product are chicken feet, while the remainder is chicken meat and turkey products, Sumner said.  Beijing lifted a nearly-five year ban on U.S. poultry imports last November, driven by an unprecedented shortage of meat in China after African swine fever killed millions of pigs in the pork-loving country.  It promised to be a lucrative market, particularly for chicken feet. Typically, U.S. processors sell them to rendering plants or pet food companies for an average of 5 cents a pound, Sumner said. The average price of chicken feet sold to China is 90 cents a pound, he said.  The economic squeeze to U.S. chicken exporters could be significant, as companies can rack up storage fees on delayed shipments, Sumner said. (Reporting by P.J.

Grocers, retailers and consumers have accused Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, Tyson Foods and other poultry processors of conspiring since 2008 to inflate prices for broiler chickens.","57":"CHICAGO, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Chicago Mercantile Exchange cattle futures dropped their daily trading limits on Monday after a fire at a major beef plant threatened to limit demand for the animals for months, traders said.

Both the live cattle and feeder cattle contracts will trade with expanded limits on Tuesday following the limit moves. Live cattle\u2019s new limit will be 4.5 cents while feeder cattle contracts will have a limit of 6.75 cents.  Lean hog futures were ended firm, with the market supported by strength in pork prices.

The halt in the use of the drug, ractopamine, reflects a change in strategy for Tyson, company watchers say. The company previously sought to profit by filling holes in U.S. supplies that were left when industry rivals like Smithfield Foods and JBS USA sent American pork to China.  Now, Tyson, Smithfield and JBS - the top three U.S. pork processors - are vying for business in China, the world\u2019s biggest pork consumer, where an outbreak of African swine fever has devastated the hog herd, pushed pork prices to record highs and sent imports rocketing. Though not harmful to humans, the disease is deadly to pigs, with no vaccine available.  But while the demand from China could be high, U.S. companies still have to cope with a significant handicap, compared to suppliers based elsewhere: Beijing has imposed tariffs on imports of U.S. pork due to the long-running trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.  \u201cOf course it\u2019s all to pave the way to get ready to start shipping very large amounts of pork to China,\u201d said Dennis Smith, a commodity broker for Archer Financial Services in Chicago.  Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat producer, is \u201cthe last shoe to drop,\u201d said Smith, who said he learned of the policy change from a farmer. The company already generates almost $1 billion in pork export sales annually.  China\u2019s pork imports climbed 76% in September from a year earlier with African swine fever having decimated its domestic hog herd, according to Chinese government data.  The disease surfaced more than a year ago in China - the first time it had been detected in Asia - and has since spread to more than 50 countries, according to the World Organization of Animal Health, including those accounting for 75% of global pork production.  Chinese authorities blocked the use of ractopamine in livestock in 2002 over health concerns. The European Union also prohibits the drug, although the United States and other countries say it can be safely used to add lean muscle to pigs.  \u201cWe believe the move to prohibit ractopamine use will allow Tyson Fresh Meats and the farmers who supply us to compete more effectively for export opportunities in even more countries,\u201d Steve Stouffer, president of Tyson Fresh Meats, said in a statement.  Tyson previously offered a small amount of ractopamine-free pork to export customers by working with farmers who raise hogs without the feed additive. Those programs \u201cno longer adequately meet growing global demand,\u201d Tyson said.  JBS USA, owned by Brazil\u2019s JBS SA, said this month it would remove ractopamine from its hog supply chain.  Smithfield, owned by China\u2019s WH Group, raises pigs on company-owned and contract farms without the drug, but still processes pigs from other farmers who use ractopamine.  Elanco Animal Health manufactures a ractopamine feed ingredient under the brand name \u2018Paylean\u2019. The company did not respond to a request for comment this month about JBS eliminating the drug.

Future Meat Technologies focuses on producing fat and muscle cells that are the core building blocks of meat, and is one of several firms working on technology to match rising demand for meat without adding more pressure on land from livestock.  The firm\u2019s founder and chief scientist, Yaakov Nahmias, said cultured meat typically had a production price of about $10,000 per kg but so far his company had reduced that to $800\/kg and had \u201ca clear roadmap to $5-$10\/kg by 2020.\u201d  Tyson\u2019s venture capital arm has supported the Jerusalem-based startup by co-leading $2.2 million in seed investment.  \u201cWe continue to invest significantly in our traditional meat business but also believe in exploring additional opportunities for growth that give consumers more choices,\u201d said Justin Whitmore, Tyson\u2019s executive vice president for corporate strategy.  In December, Tyson raised its stake in plant-based protein maker Beyond Meat.  Demand for meat is expected to double between 2000 and 2050, when the earth\u2019s population is set to surpass 9 billion, and proponents of growing meat in the lab say it is the only way to meet such demand without destroying the environment.

However, coronavirus - which has killed 563 people so far - is keeping consumers and workers at home in China, delaying purchases at stores and restaurants and slowing the unloading of products at ports.  The disruption exasperates Beijing's efforts to ensure adequate meat supplies and the plans of global companies like Tyson and JBS SA JBSS3.SA to profit from the shortage. The dual disease outbreaks also highlight the problems facing import-dependant China in its efforts to feed its population.  \u201cThere\u2019s been disruptions at the ports,\u201d Tyson Chief Executive Noel White said on a call with analysts. \u201cThat has skewed shipments, receivals.\u201d  China has increased meat imports from the United States, Europe and Brazil as African swine fever has killed up to half its pigs since August 2018.  Beijing pledged to increase purchases of U.S. farm goods in an initial trade deal last month, raising traders\u2019 expectations for more pork shipments. China also eased restrictions on U.S. beef imports and in November lifted a ban on U.S. poultry meat shipments.  But coronavirus has clouded the outlook for Chinese demand, White said, as cities have been quarantined. He said Tyson is still shipping meat to China and has orders on its books.  \u201cOnce we get past the coronavirus incident, whenever that might be, I do think there is going to be very strong demand,\u201d he said.  Meat is shipped to China in refrigerated containers that must be plugged into electrical outlets once they are offloaded to keep products cold.  Importing companies normally receive containers as they arrive, freeing up space for others. But several Chinese ports are at capacity on space for refrigerated containers and outlets because few receivers are picking them up, said Peter Friedmann, executive director of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition. Shanghai and Xingang have reported 100% utilization of available plugs, he said.  Meat shippers are also scrambling, selling to other countries or shipping to other Chinese ports, Friedmann said.  \u201cThings are really getting bad over there,\u201d USA Poultry & Egg Export Council President Jim Sumner said.","62":"May 23 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc is in talks to set up a beef processing plant in Kazakhstan, as part of the central Asian country\u2019s push to attract investment by projecting itself as an agricultural powerhouse on China\u2019s border, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing three people with knowledge of the discussions.  The multibillion-dollar investment would allow the U.S. meat company to dodge high tariffs on American agricultural goods and give a backdoor access into China, FT said here.

REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri\/File Photo  Tyson projected its U.S. pork, chicken and beef units could all benefit from increased demand linked to outbreaks of African swine fever, after the Arkansas company reported quarterly profits above analysts\u2019 estimates.  The disease, which is fatal to pigs but harmless to humans, has been detected in China, Vietnam, Cambodia, South Africa and parts of Europe.  With African swine fever in China, the world\u2019s top hog producer, about 5 percent of the global protein supply has disappeared as demand is rising, Tyson Chief Executive Noel White said.  China is expected to import more protein to make up for its hog deaths, which White estimated at 150 million to 200 million pigs. The losses could help Tyson by pushing up pork prices and prompting consumers to buy more chicken and beef as alternatives, he said.  \u201cAfrican swine fever has the potential to impact the global protein industry on a level that we have never experienced,\u201d White said.  Tyson shares rose 2.6 percent at $77.05 in afternoon trading and reached their highest price since early 2018.  The company could start benefiting from African swine fever outbreaks late in fiscal year 2019, White said.  The disease is already boosting U.S. pork and beef exports and tightening domestic supplies, chicken producer Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp said last week.  So far, though, U.S. hog prices have climbed faster than those for pork on expectations for increased Chinese demand, crimping processors\u2019 margins.  The potential for African swine fever to enter the United States represents a risk to Tyson and its rivals, such as WH Group Ltd\u2019s Smithfield Foods. U.S. cases would kill hogs and reduce exports.  \u201cThe rate in which it has spread over the course of the last 12 months makes it very plausible that it could come to the United States,\u201d White said.  African swine fever also could hurt Tyson by raising input costs for pork used in prepared food products.  Tyson tempered an annual outlook for its prepared foods unit to a range of 10 percent to 12 percent return on sales, from closer to 12 percent previously.  The company plans to raise prices for prepared foods over the next six months to compensate for more expensive raw materials, White said. He said higher meat costs will reduce demand among some consumers.  Last year, sales in Tyson\u2019s prepared foods segment reached about $8.7 billion, compared with $4.9 billion in pork, $12 billion in chicken and $15.5 billion in beef.  \u201cWe do not yet understand how pork and prepared food margins will be anything but impaired under the weight of higher hog costs,\u201d J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.  Profits in the quarter ended March 30 benefited from higher sales in beef and prepared foods.  Excluding certain items, Tyson earned $1.20 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.14. Quarterly sales were $10.44 billion, above expectations for $10.29 billion.","64":"(Corrects first and second paragraph to reflect that nuggets are not vegan or fully plant-based but vegetarian)  June 13 (Reuters) - U.S. meat processor Tyson Foods Inc on Thursday launched its first vegetarian and mixed protein products as it joined a growing number of companies catering to rising demand for plant-based meat products.  Tyson will sell vegetarian nuggets, blended protein burgers made from beef and pea protein, and sausages and meatballs that combine chicken with plants including chickpeas, black beans and quinoa, the company said in a statement.  The products, under Tyson\u2019s new Raised & Rooted brand, will be sold through its customers, sales outlets and foodservice operators, Justin Whitmore, head of Tyson\u2019s alternative protein business, said in an interview, declining to elaborate.  The nuggets will be launched in the summer, and burgers in the fall, he added.  The largest U.S. meat processor, known for its Ball Park hot dogs and Jimmy Dean sausages, believes the company\u2019s long experience in protein product development, manufacturing and distribution puts it in a unique position to enter the plant-based market and drive sales across all segments.  Whitmore said it was too early to estimate revenues, calling Tyson\u2019s plant-based business highly incremental, but he noted that that could change.  \u201cThe double-digit growth in the sector is largely driven by meat eaters who want the health and nutrition that they perceive to come from plants along with the taste they\u2019ve always had from animal protein,\u201d Whitmore said, adding that the company was working on additional plant-based products.  Tyson Chief Executive Noel White said in a statement the company remained firmly committed to expanding its traditional meat business, but is shifting toward becoming a protein company.  The change comes as many companies are trying to carve out a space in the U.S. alternative meat market which analysts estimate to be worth $100 billion by 2035.  California upstarts Beyond Meat Inc and Impossible Foods Inc each sell 100% plant-based meat alternatives to retailers and fast food chains across the United States.

Tyson declined to give details on Hayes\u2019 reasons for leaving or make him available for an interview.  Hayes, 53, had \u201cno issues of personal conduct or integrity,\u201d company spokesman Gary Mickelson said. Tyson\u2019s board considered multiple candidates to become CEO, Mickelson said.  In a statement, Hayes said it was a difficult decision to leave. \u201cAfter careful consideration and discussions with my family and the board, I know it is the right thing to do,\u201d he said.  The maker of Ball Park hotdogs and Jimmy Dean sausages cut its full-year profit forecast in July, citing uncertainty in trade policies and tariffs from importers.  Hayes led a shift of Tyson\u2019s strategy to focus on sales of packaged and prepared foods, which have higher profit margins than raw meat. However, management has been under scrutiny since it cut the full-year outlook, said Jeremy Scott, analyst for Mizuho Securities.  \u201cWhile prepared foods margins have been solid in the last three quarters, beating all expectations, investor focus has shifted to volatile commodity markets and difficult conditions in chicken,\u201d Scott said.  Hayes\u2019 resignation is the latest high-level departure in the food sector, where traditional titans have lost ground to smaller brands while facing pressure from investors to become more efficient.  Chairman John Tyson thanked Hayes and said White had deep knowledge of the company.

The closures are limiting the amount of meat the United States can produce during the outbreak and adding stress on farmers who are losing markets for their pigs.  Lockdowns that aim to stop the spread of the coronavirus have also prevented farmers around the globe from delivering food products to consumers. Millions of laborers cannot get to fields for harvesting and planting, and there are too few truckers to keep goods moving.  Tyson Foods, the largest U.S. meat supplier, said it will indefinitely suspend operations at its largest pork plant in Waterloo, Iowa, after operating at reduced capacity.  Plant employees tested positive for the virus, and others stayed home out of fear of becoming infected. The facility slaughters about 19,500 hogs a day, or about 5% of total U.S. pork production, according to industry data.  Tyson also plans to close a pork processing facility in Logansport, Indiana, while its more than 2,200 workers at the plant undergo testing for COVID-19.  \u201cConsumers will see an impact at the grocery store as production slows,\u201d Tyson Fresh Meats Group President Steve Stouffer said.  \u201cIt means the loss of a vital market outlet for farmers and further contributes to the disruption of the nation\u2019s pork supply.\u201d  When the Logansport facility closes, slaughterhouses that account for 19% of pork production in the United States will be shut.  Brazilian-owned JBS USA and WH Group\u2019s Smithfield Foods have also each indefinitely closed massive pork plants in Minnesota and South Dakota, respectively.  Reduced meat output comes as demand has increased at grocery stores, while restaurant dining rooms are closed due to the virus.  Tyson said 2,800 workers at the Iowa plant would be compensated during the closure and invited to the facility later this week for coronavirus testing. The outcome of the tests and other factors will determine when the facility will reopen, according to the company.  Other U.S. meat and poultry plants are operating at reduced capacity. Tyson is running a pork plant in Columbus Junction, Iowa, with limited operations after idling it for two weeks.  Iowa farmer Randy Francis delivers 300 pigs to 500 pigs a week to the Waterloo plant for slaughter that are backing up in his barns. He hopes to truck the animals to other plants, but they are already overloaded with other hogs displaced by the shutdowns.  The pigs will put on more weight than normal due to the delays, Francis said. That could make their meat fattier or tougher to chew when they are eventually slaughtered, he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s definitely scary times,\u201d Francis said.","67":"FILE PHOTO: Packages of Tyson food beef meat loaf are reflected in a mirror as they sit on a refrigerator for sale at a grocery store in Encinitas, California May 29, 2014.

Tyson recorded a $40 million gain in its chicken unit in the quarter that ended on June 29 as a rise in corn futures benefited its market positions. The company warned last month that profit would likely be reversed.  The beef slaughterhouse damaged by a fire is expected to resume business as usual by the end of the year, White said.

FILE PHOTO: The exterior of the Tyson Fresh Meats processing plant is seen three days after a fire heavily damaged the facility in the Finney County town of Holcomb, Kansas, U.S. August 12, 2019. REUTERS\/Adam Shrimplin\/File Photo  Cattle prices have tanked because the fire temporarily eliminated a key buyer of livestock. Farmers have worried that meat packers such as Tyson, Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and JBS USA [JBS.UL] would take advantage of the situation by dropping their offering prices.  At the same time, beef prices climbed as buyers for restaurants, food service companies and grocery chains scrambled for meat.  Profit margins for the packers are above $400 per head of cattle slaughtered, up from around $150 before the fire and well above the previous record of $308, according to Denver-based livestock marketing advisory service HedgersEdge.com.  The USDA will investigate whether there is evidence of price manipulation, collusion or other unfair practices, according to a statement.  \u201cIf any unfair practices are detected, we will take quick enforcement action,\u201d Perdue said.  Tyson said it would cooperate with the investigation. The company resumed some limited work at the plant this week, but it will take a few months to repair damage to the roof and equipment inside, according to a statement.  Cargill and JBS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The North American Meat Institute, an industry group that represents meat companies, said packers acted properly after the fire disrupted beef production.

But a surge in demand for products from chicken and beef to dry pasta at supermarkets has left store shelves and meat cases empty, alarming consumers.  \u201cOnce we are able to replenish supplies, which is probably going to take another week or so, then I think that we\u2019ll be back in better equilibrium between supply and demand,\u201d Tyson CEO Noel White said in an interview.  He later added: \u201cIn the short term, being a matter of weeks, there are some imbalances that exist.\u201d  The \u201cimbalances\u201d are more demand than supply in sectors like retail stores, White said. The total amount of beef, pork and poultry available in the United States is up about 2% to 3% from last year, he said.  Orders for meat from grocery stores were significantly higher than usual through the weekend, after demand began to shift away from restaurants last week, White said.  \u201cThe demand hit very quickly,\u201d White said. \u201cThe order fill rate has improved. It\u2019s still not where we would expect it to be.\u201d  Increased buying at supermarkets has lifted overall demand for meat, although the increase has been largely offset by reduced demand from restaurants, White said. Demand from casual dining restaurants, in particular, has suffered, though fast-food restaurants continue to benefit from strong drive-through traffic, he said. Tyson is the largest U.S. meat supplier and counts companies like McDonald\u2019s Corp as customers.  To meet increased retail demand, Tyson has shifted processing facilities to produce food for grocery stores instead of restaurants, White said. The company is running slaughterhouses at full capacity and on weekends, he said.  U.S. cattle futures have dropped sharply on concerns slaughterhouses will close if the novel coronavirus spreads among workers.  To avoid shutdowns, Tyson has begun taking employees\u2019 temperatures at two processing facilities and is expanding the practice to all U.S. workers, according to the company. It expects deliveries of several thousand thermometers on Thursday, White said.","105":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc faces pressure from nuns, the Teamsters union and asset managers to disclose more about its lobbying and human-rights policies, after meatpacking workers were ravaged by COVID-19 last year.

Another shareholder proposal calls for a plan to end a dual-class share structure under which the Tyson family has voting power over about 71% of the company\u2019s outstanding stock, according to regulatory filings.  The family\u2019s voting power will likely mean the proposals fail, but the meeting to be held after Tyson earnings are released on Thursday highlights widening calls for meat companies to answer for complaints brought about by the pandemic.  Influential proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services recommend investors support all three measures.  Twenty-two religious organizations and BMO Asset Management are pushing the proposal for a report on the human-rights impacts of Tyson\u2019s business, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Among the supporters is Sister Judy Sinnwell, chair of socially responsible investing for the Sisters of St. Francis in Dubuque, Iowa. She said she believes Tyson workers did not receive adequate warnings about COVID-19 or protection from the virus.  \u201cCOVID made it really, really visible that workers were not taken care of,\u201d Sinnwell, 78, said in a phone interview.  Tyson said employee health is its top priority and that it already has policies to protect human rights, making an additional report unnecessary. The company said it spent $540 million on COVID-19-related costs in fiscal-year 2020, including about $300 million on bonuses for workers, and has taken steps to protect them from the coronavirus.  The company was sued last week for allegedly defrauding shareholders about its ability to combat the spread of the virus.  In December, Tyson fired seven managers at an Iowa pork plant after investigating allegations that they took bets on how many employees would catch COVID-19.  The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents some Tyson workers, submitted the shareholder proposal urging Tyson to expand lobbying disclosures.  The union wants more information about Tyson\u2019s payments to trade organizations, after an industry group lobbied the Trump administration to waive limits on slaughtering speeds in chicken plants last year, said Louis Malizia, assistant director of the Teamsters\u2019 capital strategies.  The meat sector also supported an order from former President Donald Trump last year to keep slaughterhouses open, despite concerns about coronavirus outbreaks.  Tyson said trade associations address issues that can benefit the company and that its political contributions are reported in accordance with applicable laws.  The company said its dual-class share structure increases the Tyson family\u2019s interest in the company\u2019s long-term success, providing stability during the pandemic and other crises.

Stronger demand for beef offset weaker results in Tyson\u2019s pork and chicken units, which the company said were hurt by trade disputes between the United States and major importers such as Mexico and China.  Tyson shares rose 2.6 percent to $59.28 in afternoon trading, but are still down 27 percent for the year.  The maker of Ball Park hotdogs and Jimmy Dean sausages has come under pressure from trade spats that have disrupted U.S. pork exports, increased domestic supplies and hurt prices. Tyson last week cut its full-year profit forecast, citing uncertainty in trade policies and tariffs from importers.  Sales volume for Tyson\u2019s beef rose in the third quarter due to a decline in prices fueled by increased cattle supplies, according to the company.  Those lower prices prompted some casual U.S. restaurants to promote beef products instead of chicken, Chief Executive Tom Hayes said.  \u201cIntertwined with uncertainty in trade policies and tariffs are increasing supplies of relatively low-priced beef and pork that are competing with chicken,\u201d he said on a conference call.  The shift away from chicken helped Tyson double its beef unit\u2019s operating income from a year ago to $318 million, accounting for 40 percent of its total for the quarter. Operating margins for beef jumped to 8 percent from 3.7 percent a year earlier.  In Tyson\u2019s chicken business, operating income fell 35 percent to $189 million. Margins dropped to 6.4 percent from 10.2 percent.  \u201cChicken margins came in well below forecast on a sharp decline in demand given the surge in competing red meat supplies,\u201d said Jeremy Scott, vice president of research for Mizuho Securities.  Tyson\u2019s pork unit saw operating income fall 51 percent to $67 million, while margins weakened to 5.6 percent from 10.3 percent a year earlier.  In a good sign for Tyson, pork margins improved in July, Scott said.  Net income attributable to Tyson rose to $541 million, or $1.47 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $447 million, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier.  Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.40 per share on revenue of $10.28 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. Excluding certain items, the company earned $1.50 per share.

Meatpacking plants were associated with at least 236,000 coronavirus cases and up to 5,200 deaths as of July, according to the National Academy of Sciences.  Labor unions and workers have accused the companies of taking inadequate steps to protect workers.  Smithfield, Tyson and JBS said they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on worker safety, bonuses and other measures. All three companies said they would cooperate with the investigation.  The Meat Institute trade group said case rates for industry workers were five times lower in December than they were in May, while infections rose for the U.S. population as a whole.  The coronavirus subcommittee\u2019s chairman, U.S. Representative James Clyburn, said his panel would also examine OSHA\u2019s enforcement efforts under Trump, which he described as ineffective.  \u201cIt is imperative that the previous Administration\u2019s shortcomings are swiftly identified and rectified to save lives in the months before coronavirus vaccinations are available for all Americans,\u201d he said in a statement.  In response, OSHA said more stringent safety guidelines issued to employers on Friday were a \u201cfirst step\u201d in its efforts to work with Congress on worker protections.  A Reuters investigation found that workplace inspections by OSHA dropped 44% between March, when the virus began to spread widely in the United States, and December.  OSHA last year fined Smithfield, owned by Hong Kong-listed WH Group Ltd, $13,494 for a violation at its Sioux Falls, South Dakota, plant, where four workers died and nearly 1,300 were infected. The agency fined JBS $15,615 for a violation at its Greeley, Colorado, plant, where six died and about 300 tested positive. Both companies are appealing the fines."}}
