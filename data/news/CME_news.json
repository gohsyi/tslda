comments, details and updates prices) * U.S. Senate overwhelmingly backs $2 trln bill * Initial U.S. jobless claims data due at 1230 GMT * Palladium eases after Wednesday's 20% surge By Shreyansi Singh March 26 (Reuters) - Gold prices fell on Thursday as expectations of a surge in U.S. jobless claims due to the coronavirus outbreak eclipsed a massive U.S. stimulus package and kept alive a rush for cash among investors. Spot gold was down 0.7% to $1,602.06 per ounce by 0751 GMT, after falling 1% earlier in the session. \"There is no positive growth story here until business reopens, and that might see all these assets, that have been benefiting from the U.S. Federal Reserve's (recent) stimulus announcement, including gold, come back down,\" said DailyFx currency strategist Ilya Spivak. The U.S. Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly backed a $2 trillion bill aimed at helping unemployed workers and industries hurt by the coronavirus. This came after the Fed said on Monday it would buy bonds in unlimited numbers and backstop direct loans to companies. Asian stock markets nudged up, but gains were capped as investors were torn between relief at the package and concern as to whether it will be enough to weather the coming storm. Data showing initial jobless claims in the United States is due at 1230 GMT, with forecasts ranging from 250,000 claims all the way up to 4 million. \"There's panic among traders and investors and they don't trust even gold,\" said Hareesh V, head of commodity research at Geojit Financial Services. Gold market participants, meanwhile, are concerned about a supply squeeze in the market, following a sharp divergence in London and New York prices as the coronavirus closed precious metals refineries. U.S. exchange operator CME Group on Tuesday announced a new gold futures contract to combat price volatility caused by the shutdown of gold supply routes, but traders and bankers said it would not immediately calm markets. U.S. gold futures fell 0.8% to $1,620.00 per ounce, retreating from a rally to $1,699.30 an ounce on Wednesday, but were above the London spot contract. Among other precious metals, palladium eased 2.2% to $2,265.50 per ounce, having registered its best daily gain since 1997 in the last session as a lockdown in major producer South Africa exacerbated supply woes. \"Palladium prices will normalise in some time, it's merely speculation as of now. The automobile industry might face the worst hit due to global demand slowdown,\" said Jigar Trivedi, commodities analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers in Mumbai. Platinum slipped 2.3% to $721.18 an ounce, while silver was down 1% to $14.29. (Reporting by Shreyansi Singh and K. Sathya Narayanan in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Subhranshu Sahu)","1":"LONDON (Reuters) - Top trading exchanges said on Tuesday they would not rush into introducing \u201cspeed bumps\u201d to slow down high-technology trading and ensure a more level playing field with traditional market participants.  Last month, Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE) was given permission from U.S. regulators to introduce the first \u201cspeed bump - or Passive Order Protection feature - in the U.S. futures markets. That followed complaints from some market players that hi-tech traders had an unfair speed advantage forcing them to spend large sums on technology.  Thomas Book, chief executive of Germany\u2019s Eurex exchange, said on Tuesday it had launched a six-month pilot scheme.  \u201cI don\u2019t like the term speed bump,\u201d Book told the annual IDX derivatives industry conference in London.  The pilot was not about discriminating in favor or against certain market users or about slowing down trading, he said, adding that high-speed traders played a useful role in markets.  \u201cWe are about fairness in price discovery,\u201d Book said, referring to the creation of prices when buy and sell orders are matched.

The world\u2019s oldest and largest market for industrial metals wants a stronger portfolio of products as competition intensifies with rival exchanges, such as CME Group Inc. of the United States.  The steel and alumina contracts have the best chance of succeeding, according to analysts, traders and other industry sources.  The 142-year-old LME has lost market share in recent years to the CME and China\u2019s Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE).  The LME has been slower than its rivals to launch new products, but it has recently developed new technology that makes launching new contracts easier, faster and less expensive.  The exchange hopes to boost volumes to make up for weaker revenues last year resulting from fee cuts as it rowed back after heavy criticism about a previous jump in fees.  Volumes at the LME rose 5 percent last year, but core profit fell by 10 percent in the commodities segment of its parent, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd.  MASSIVE STEEL SECTOR  The LME has high hopes for its new HRC contracts, believing it can tap into a massive global steel sector that has seen surging volumes develop in Chinese ferrous contracts.  HRC is steel that is heat processed into metal sheets used for car bodies and household appliances.  The LME is launching regional HRC contracts initially covering North America and China, and later adding northern Europe.  They will compete with the CME\u2019s Nymex exchange for U.S. metal and on ShFE for Chinese material.  The LME already has steel rebar and scrap contracts.  The LME also plans to launch a contract for alumina, the raw material to make aluminium, which has seen sharp price swings recently.  The alumina price twice spiked and tumbled last year, opening up a market for both consumers and producers to hedge the price.  The LME already has a physically-settled contract in cobalt , a metal key for electric vehicle batteries, but it hopes to gain more traction with its new cash-settled product <.  The other new products are minor metal molybdenum plus two regional aluminium premium contracts for U.S. Midwest and Europe.

The suspension is effective from April 10, a notice on the CME website showed.  The U.S. Treasury last Friday slapped sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs and 12 firms they own or control, saying they were profiting from a Russian state engaged in \u201cmalign activities\u201d around the world.  This includes Hong Kong-listed Rusal, which analysts at CRU say accounts for 14 percent of aluminum supplies outside top producer China. Global output this year is estimated at 65 million tonnes.  CME warehouses in the United States hold nearly 54,000 tonnes of aluminum, and most of that is in Owensboro.  The London Metal Exchange also on Tuesday said Rusal\u2019s aluminum would be suspended from its list of approved brands from April 17 after some members raised concerns about settling contracts with sanctions-hit companies.  Rusal\u2019s metal in LME warehouses before April 6 is not affected, but sources say few companies will want to hold it.","5":"(Repeats story from Friday)  * LME Volumes by Contract: tmsnrt.rs\/2utkqu5  * ShFE Volumes by Contract: tmsnrt.rs\/2QVy54Q  LONDON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Base metals trading volumes shrank on all three major global exchanges last year as trade war uncertainty and range-bound markets dampened speculative activity.  \u2018Doctor Copper\u2019 has long been a favourite metallic play among punters and sliding volumes were symptomatic of a sector that was largely out of favour with the money men.  The London Metal Exchange\u2019s (LME) copper contract saw activity fall by 8% last year. The declines were more pronounced on both the CME and Shanghai Futures Exchanges (ShFE) contracts with volumes slumping by 25% and 29% respectively.  Only nickel bucked the broader trend thanks to heightened price volatility and the metal\u2019s electric vehicle credentials. Trading volumes rose by 3% in London and by 40% in Shanghai, where nickel has also assumed the role of junior partner in a proxy trade with the much larger iron ore market.  Exchanges can\u2019t do much about manufacturing slowdown or the resulting range-bound pricing but they are expanding their product range and opening up entirely new markets.  BASE METALS DOWNTURN  It was a year to forget for many of the base metals with copper, aluminium, zinc and lead closing out 2019 little changed from year-start levels.  Total volumes on the London market, which still dominates physical pricing, fell by 4.6% last year after a similar-sized rise in 2018.  In truth the LME fared slightly better than suggested by the headline figure, which includes so-called \u201cUNA\u201d trades introduced to comply with European MiFIDII regulations. Strip those out and the year-on-year decline was only 1.9%.  Even so, activity on all the LME\u2019s core contracts fell last year with the exception of nickel, the top price performer among the base metals in 2019, and tin, the weakest price performer. The same two metals were the only two to register higher volumes in Shanghai.  Tin remains a tiny futures market by comparison with nickel but even it dwarfs the LME\u2019s aluminium alloy contract, which with volume growth of 7% was the unlikely star performer last year.  That outperformance, however, should be seen in the context of falling activity in each of the previous four years.  NEW PRODUCTS  The LME launched two new aluminium premium contracts in March last year but with only limited success. The North American contract traded just 939 lots while the European product failed to trade at all.  CME, which launched the first of its four aluminium premium contracts as far back as 2013, appears to have captured this particular part of the market with total volumes last year of 152,353 contracts.  Its underlying aluminium contract looked in danger of disappearing altogether with no trades at all in 2018 but the contract sprang into life in the second half of 2019 after CME extended physical delivery to Asian locations such as Singapore and the Malaysian ports of Johor and Port Klang. They currently account for 9,291 tonnes of CME\u2019s total 17,145 tonnes of registered aluminium stocks.  CME zinc stocks have shrunk to just 6 tonnes and the contract, which didn\u2019t trade in the second half of the year, looks perilously close to following the CME lead contract into oblivion.  Volumes in the CME\u2019s copper options contract doubled year-on-year and the exchange\u2019s weekly options contracts, launched in 2018, steadily gained traction over the course of 2019.  As did the ShFE copper options contract, also launched in 2018. Almost 8.4 million lots traded in 2019 with open interest in December standing at 64,526 lots, up 16% on December 2018.  More new base metal products were launched last year by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx), the owner of the LME.  A suite of dollar-denominated \u201cmini\u201d contracts appear to be succeeding where the yuan-denominated offering has largely failed. Total volume was 29,334 contracts since launch in August, compared with just 237 over the whole year for the Chinese currency products.  THE NEW STEEL FRONTIER  All three exchanges are also making steady inroads into the ferrous sector, which has historically proved stubbornly resistant to futures trading.  The LME\u2019s scrap and rebar contracts have traded since the start of 2018 and are seeing respectable activity. Two new contracts, covering hot rolled coil (HRC) in China and North America, have seen volumes build since trading started in March last year. The former set a new monthly volume record of 16,297 lots in December, bringing the 2019 total to 45,884 lots.  The exchange has dropped plenty of hints it will consider building out its ferrous portfolio further, given the level of participation in the current offerings.  It\u2019s noticeable that the CME\u2019s HRC contract has seen increased action since the LME re-entered the steel sector after the failure of its former billet contract. CME volumes grew by 89% in 2018 and by another 45% last year, when the equivalent of almost 3.5 million tonnes traded.  ShFE currently runs the highest-volume global steel contract. Steel rebar volumes dropped 12% last year but still total led 930 million contracts. Even allowing for the fact that ShFE double-counts its volumes, a practice that changed at the start of 2020, it\u2019s still a staggering figure.  The Chinese exchange last year extended its ferrous product range with a new stainless contract, which traded 1.2 million lots in the first four months.  QIANHAI SURPRISE  Not all new products flourish and the LME\u2019s new cobalt and molybdenum contracts failed to get any traction last year.  The lack of interest in the new cash-settled cobalt contract is puzzling, given the steady decline in activity in the older physically deliverable contract, which saw volumes slump by 26% last year. It\u2019s not as if cobalt hasn\u2019t been volatile or that carmakers haven\u2019t expressed support for a way of hedging a key input into electric batteries.  Also strange is the lack of traction gained by either the CME or LME alumina contracts, given the sector has switched towards spot pricing.  CME alumina volumes fell by 79% last year to 118,200 tonnes, while the LME\u2019s new alumina contract notched up trades of just 46,000 tonnes.  Both were eclipsed by the 374,011 tonnes traded on the Qianhai Mercantile Exchange, HKEx\u2019s foray into mainland China.  The QME is something of an anomaly in the global metals exchange world. Barred from offering futures products in mainland China, HKEx has been building out a physical exchange.  Alumina was one of five metallic offerings launched last year. The others are copper cathode, copper rod, aluminium ingot and aluminium billet.  It\u2019s taken several years for HKEx to get the QME up and running but it is worth watching because it represents a clear challenge to the Chinese incumbent in Shanghai.  The big three exchanges currently co-exist in a relatively peaceful order. What the Chinese like to call a \u201cwin-win\u201d scenario may not last long if QME picks up trading momentum.","6":"Jan 6 (Reuters) - Michael Spencer, the founder of fintech company NEX Group, has replaced former Conservative Party Chair Lord Saatchi as chairman of the Centre for Policy Studies, the UK-based think tank said on Monday.

FILE PHOTO: he logo of stock market operator Euronext is seen on a building in the financial district of la Defense in Courbevoie, near Paris, France, May 14, 2018. REUTERS\/Charles Platiau\/File Photo  SIX made a friendly all-cash offer for the Spanish bourse, whose shares jumped by more than a third in early trading, while Euronext said it was in talks with BME with a view to a potential bid, without saying how much it was prepared to pay.  With European sector leaders Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE and London Stock Exchange (LSE) LSE.L effectively too big to consolidate without raising serious competition concerns, mergers are focused on smaller players, with Euronext having already scooped up the Dublin and Oslo exchanges.  SIX has offered BME 34 euros per share, implying a total equity value of 2.843 billion euros ($3.13 billion), a hefty 34% premium over BME\u2019s market capitalization of just over 2 billion euros before the offer was announced.  The Swiss exchange\u2019s proposed deal is \u201cvery much\u201d about growing the revenues of both businesses, SIX Chief Executive Jos Dijsselhof told reporters on Monday, adding that BME are \u201chappy with the commitments made by SIX thus far\u201d.  \u201cThey have stated we are offering a fair price. It is our expectation we will retain the listing,\u201d Dijsselhof said, adding that it was too early to talk about raising the offer.  Shares of BME, among the smallest of Europe\u2019s exchanges, were up 37% at 34.7 euros by 1152 GMT. It said SIX\u2019s offer \u201creasonably\u201d reflected its current value.  Euronext, which has a market cap of around 5 billion euros, had denied earlier this month that it was bidding for BME.  BME board members and shareholders must now decide whether to wait for any formal Euronext offer before deciding on the Swiss bid.  Euronext said last month it has several hundreds of millions of euros for acquisitions and could tap markets to boost its war chest to over two billion euros.  NUMBER THREE  Taking over BME would not dramatically alter the overall European exchange landscape, but would help to buttress SIX or Euronext.  Euronext, whose shares rose 1.4% to 72.85 euros on Monday, is a minnow compared to LSE and Deutsche Boerse, which have market capitalizations of 24 billion pounds ($31.11 billion) and 26 billion euros, respectively.  But it has gradually built up its presence and now operates exchanges in Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, France and Ireland, with Spain an obvious gap.  SIX is focused on Switzerland and buying BME would give it a base inside the European Union and put the combined group in third place behind LSE and Deutsche Boerse in terms of revenues and profit, Citi said.  An EU base would be a boost to Switzerland after Brussels blocked EU-based investors from trading on Swiss exchanges from July this year as a row escalated over a stalled bilateral treaty.  SIX said the deal would have no bearing on Bern\u2019s broader political discussion with Brussels, a row which has also meant that Swiss shares can only be bought and sold via Switzerland\u2019s two exchanges.  Analysts at Citi said buying BME would enable the Swiss bourse to offer clearing and settlement of shares inside the EU by using the Spanish bourse\u2019s infrastructure.  SIX said its proposed purchase would be financed through a combination of existing cash resources and access to capital markets.  Brokers in Madrid said that as a standalone exchange, BME had been diversifying revenues away from a shrinking volume of share trading.  Spain would likely need reassurances that local jobs would not be lost if trading in Spanish shares migrated to a central platform run by SIX or Euronext.  The country\u2019s government, which is expected to have the final say on any takeover, and Spanish markets watchdog CNMV had no comment.  BME said it would keep its current business activities, Spanish headquarters and local strategy for a four-year transitional period at least.","9":"Sept 13 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s antitrust watchdog is launching an investigation into whether U.S. exchange operator CME Group\u2019s $5.5 billion acquisition of NEX Group will lessen competition, the regulator said on Thursday.

The MSCI All-Country World stock index, which tracks 47 countries, gained 0.11 percent after three sessions of losses, but was set for a weekly fall of about 0.6 percent.  Market participants have been anxious this week over turmoil in the U.S. government and the spectre of a global trade war, after U.S. President Donald Trump ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, viewed as a free trade proponent, then sought to impose $60 billion of tariffs on Chinese imports.  Headlines on Thursday reinforced those concerns, with the Washington Post reporting Trump was committed to removing H.R. McMaster as national security advisor, and the New York Times saying that U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had subpoenaed documents related to Trump\u2019s businesses.  Simmering tensions between Russia and Britain, and fears about creeping far-right influence in Italy\u2019s government, contributed to investor worries.

Britain\u2019s top share index fell 1.7 percent to 7,042 points, its lowest level since December 2016, while the more domestically exposed mid cap index limited its decline to 0.6 percent.  Britain and the EU agreed to a transition period to avoid a \u201ccliff edge\u201d Brexit next year -- though only after London accepted a potential solution for the border with the Irish Republic that may face stiff domestic opposition.  Confirmation that Britain would remain as effectively a non-voting EU member for 21 months until the end of 2020 boosted the pound but further hit the FTSE, already weighed down by a 50 percent drop in Micro Focus following a gloomy revenue outlook.  \u201cThe implications for UK equity markets are multi-faceted,\u201d said Bill McQuaker, portfolio manager at Fidelity International.  \u201cWhile investors should view this as a positive development for domestically exposed UK companies, the FTSE 100 has significant exposure to overseas earnings, and a stronger pound is therefore a headwind,\u201d he said.  Big international FTSE stocks like British American Tobacco , BP, HSBC and Diageo were all sharply lower, down between 1.6 and 3.7 percent, while among companies that benefit from a strong pound, gambling company William Hill rose 4.2 percent and real estate firm Land Securities added 3.3 percent.  Elsewhere, shares in software company Micro Focus plummeted 46.3 percent, its biggest ever one-day loss, after its CEO quit and it cut its revenue outlook.  Micro Focus has had problems stemming from assets it bought from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, on which it spent $8.8 billion in 2017.  \u201cLarge acquisitions are inherently risky as they come with integration challenges. Micro Focus appears to have underestimated these challenges and is now suffering,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said.  Micro Focus fell around 17 percent back in January after a disappointing set of results and outlook.  Barclays jumped 3.6 percent after activist investor Sherborne acquired 5 percent of voting rights in the bank.  Investors have been putting pressure on Barclays to become a profitable investment banking force. It has struggled due to low volatility and tougher regulations on capital requirements.  Mid-cap company Hammerson was a stand-out gainer, up 24 percent. Shares in the UK retail landlord rose following news that it had been approached by French shopping centre operator Klepierre earlier in the month.  Hammerson rejected Klepierre\u2019s takeover bid, valued at 4.88 billion pounds ($6.80 billion), saying it \u201cvery significantly\u201d undervalued the company.  Although the pound rose on Monday and has recovered from lows hit in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum in June 2016, it still remains below the levels it was before the vote.  Its depreciation has made British targets more affordable to overseas buyers, as highlighted by Klepierre\u2019s approach for Hammerson.  \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that large UK companies are being staked out by potential overseas interest,\u201d Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said.  \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of undervaluation creeping in because of potential threats around Brexit, real or imagined, and that can make companies quite attractive, and then many are willing sellers because of the same reason,\u201d Odeluga added, pointing to CME\u2019s bid for NEX Group last week.","14":"(Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve on Tuesday will begin to publish the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), a rate that regulators hope will eventually be adopted to back U.S. dollar-based derivatives and loans. The aim is that the new rate will eventually reduce markets\u2019 dependence on Libor.  FILE PHOTO: The corner stone of the New York Federal Reserve Bank is seen surrounded by financial institutions in New York City, New York, U.S., March 25, 2015. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Following are some facts about the rate.  What is SOFR?  SOFR is based on transactions in the Treasury repurchase market, where banks and investors borrow or loan Treasuries overnight. A group of large banks, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC), selected the rate as an alternative to the London interbank offered rate (Libor) in derivatives. It cited the depth and robustness of the market where around $800 billion is traded daily.  Why do we need a new rate?  Regulators including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are seeking to reduce markets\u2019 reliance on Libor due to a decline in loans backing the rate. If the rate stops being published \u201cthat has all the potential of being a pretty significant financial stability problem,\u201d Powell said in February.  The ARRC, which selected SOFR as an alternative rate, said in March that Libor underpins $200 trillion in derivatives and loans, more than previously thought, underscoring the necessity of promoting a robust alternative. Derivatives account for 95 percent of the exposures.  Why was there a decline in usage of Libor?  Reforms to banking and money market fund regulations resulted in fewer interbank short-term loans and reduced demand for the bank debt. Also, Libor\u2019s reputation was damaged by charges that banks manipulated the rate before and during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, often to book larger profits on derivatives based on the rate. Libor rates are sometimes estimated rather than based on actual transactions.  Will it replace Libor?  SOFR is intended to work alongside Libor. Over time, regulators hope that more derivatives and loans will be backed by the rate, which will decrease the importance of Libor. The New York Fed\u2019s publication of the rate is the first in a series of steps to enable a transition. The CME Group will begin trading futures based on the rate on May 7. Major dealers and clearinghouses that guarantee interest rate swap trades are also working to enable swaps based on the new rate. The head of Britain\u2019s financial markets regulator said last year that a Libor substitute must be in place for banks to use by the end of 2021, and that Libor must be replaced because there are not enough transactions underpinning the rates.  Is this the first global effort to find an alternative?  No. Regulators have pushed internationally to find alternatives to Libor and its equivalents. A British committee last year selected SONIA, an unsecured overnight lending rate, as an alternative to sterling-based Libor and Japan selected TONAR as an alternative to yen Libor, also an unsecured rate.

FILE PHOTO: Gold bullion is displayed at GoldSilver Central's office in Singapore June 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Edgar Su  Since March, when volatility linked to the pandemic dampened banks\u2019 willingness to sell futures contracts, the cost of swapping expiring futures for later-dated ones - a \u201croll\u201d that investors wishing to maintain their positions must perform every few months - has been far higher than usual.  This has deterred some investors from buying and holding gold on CME Group\u2019s Comex exchange in New York, the world\u2019s largest precious metals futures trading venue.  It also generated record revenues for investment banks and others selling gold - income that will likely fall back as trading normalises.  The roll of futures expiring in December has been much cheaper.  More than 400,000 December contracts representing over 40 million ounces of gold have been swapped this month for futures expiring in February which have cost around $6 an ounce more, CME and Refinitiv data show.  That compares to a roughly $25 an ounce premium for the December future over the August one when those two contracts were exchanged, and a cost of around $15 an ounce to roll to August from June.  The cost of the December to February roll has also been more stable than any since March as investors spaced out their transactions over a longer period.  CME declined to comment.  Graphic: The gold futures roll  Forty million ounces of gold is worth around $70 billion (52.54 billion pounds) at current prices and at $6 an ounce costs around $250 million to roll.  Sellers of futures make money when the price difference between the expiring and later-dated futures exceeds the cost of financing and storing gold for the period between the two.  \u201cThe spread is tighter (this time) but wider than it would be before March,\u201d said an executive at a large gold trading bank, adding that because interest rates are so low, the December roll is still very profitable.  Also pointing to a normalisation of the market are lower gold deliveries.  Since March, record amounts of physical gold have changed hands on Comex, peaking in June with deliveries against 55,102 contracts representing 5.5 million ounces.  As of Monday, traders had signalled they would deliver against 5,371 December contracts and 31,861 contracts remained open. Some of these will be delivered against and others rolled forward in the coming weeks.  Graphic: Comex gold rush  The market is still not fully recovered. Gold prices rallied to record highs this year, and such rallies usually increase trading activity, but the number of active Comex contracts has lagged, with some investors using exchange-traded funds instead.  \u201cAn important measure of how well the market has recovered is when open interest picks up and the roll cost stays low,\u201d said John Reade, chief strategist at the World Gold Council.

FILE PHOTO: Oil pump jacks work at sunset near Midland, Texas, U.S., August 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Jessica Lutz  The U.S. oil trading market has developed enough liquidity to support new financial instruments to guard against unexpected shifts in local prices due to pipeline outages or a sudden drop in exports that can ripple through regional crude markets.  Prior to the end of a four-decade crude export ban, most U.S. crude oil that was not used domestically was sent through Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures (WTI) CLc1.  Now, buyers and sellers are increasingly looking at other points of delivery for pricing, particularly Houston, now that the country sends more than three million barrels of oil overseas daily.  \"We've got the regionalization of U.S. crude,\" said Owain Johnson, managing director for energy research and development at exchange operator CME Group Inc, which about a year ago launched a crude futures contract deliverable at Houston HMLc1.  He noted liquidity - the ease of trading a particular instrument due to active market participants - is growing in contracts trading Houston-delivered oil and grades out of Louisiana\u2019s offshore terminal, among others.  The number of outstanding open contracts for the spread between WTI crude delivered to the growing export hub in Houston and to Cushing-delivered WTI futures rose to nearly 160,000 in July, a record, according to CME data.  The WTI Houston contract is based on assessments from price reporting agency Argus Media.  Graphic: Open interest WTI Houston vs WTI Trade Month Futures,  \u201cThese grades didn\u2019t exist as derivatives in 2016 but these are now very liquid markets for hedging,\u201d Johnson said.  Hedges specific to oil sales from a particular locale started to spike in the United States in early 2018, according to CME.  Regional price variances have recently hurt producers due to pipeline bottlenecks that kept oil from getting to markets, increasing the need for different contracts to handle the risk.  Last year, prices in Midland, Texas, slumped to a four-year low at about $17 per barrel below WTI futures as surging production overwhelmed pipeline capacity. Producers who hedged using oil delivered to Cushing were hurt by that collapse in local prices which was not mirrored in WTI futures.  \u201cHedging WTI price risk often suited the risk profile well until regional bottlenecks began to emerge, which in turn exposed producers to risks that previously were not accounted for,\u201d said Michael Tran, managing director of energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York.  Open interest in the spread between Argus WTI Midland to WTI futures in September is currently about 130,000 lots, lower than the all-time highs near 180,000 contracts, but still far more than 2017, when it was less than 40,000 contracts.  Companies are taking advantage of new contracts to add to their hedging capacity. Permian producer Parsley Energy Inc PE.N and smaller rival shale producer QEP Resources Inc QEP.N began hedging using WTI Houston basis swaps for a part of their 2019 production, filings showed.  Parsley did not have an immediate comment. QEP did not respond to a request for comment.  An oil basis swap is a derivative contract that fixes the price difference between two sales points for specified crude volumes over a particular time period. Several other shale producers already use basis swaps for the spread between WTI in Midland, Texas and WTI Cushing, regulatory filings show.  With a slate of new pipelines coming online in the United States thanks to the shale boom, more midstream companies are now using niche hedging strategies as well, dealers and analysts said.","17":"(Reuters) - London Stock Exchange Group LSE.L emerged from what was a troubling 2017 with a 47 percent profit jump despite turgid markets, helping to ease lingering concern over management upheaval and its aborted Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE merger.

FILE PHOTO: Canary Wharf and the city are seen at sunset in London, December 14, 2016. REUTERS\/Eddie Keogh  Few expect London to lose its position as Europe\u2019s biggest financial hub, but Britain\u2019s departure from the EU is turning into a multibillion-euro boost for the bloc\u2019s protracted efforts to build a deeper capital market to rival the UK capital.  Britain\u2019s parliament is due to vote on Tuesday on a divorce settlement with the EU that includes a \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d transition period from March 29 to the end of 2020.  Three weeks away from Brexit Day, it is unclear whether a deal will pass, whether Brexit will be delayed, or whether Britain will leave with no agreement at all.  But whatever happens, a fundamental change in European markets is underway.  \u201cThe ship has sailed and market infrastructure has changed with people having made their decision, taken premises, hired staff and doing all the testing,\u201d said Steve Grob, head of marketing at trading technology firm ION Markets.  Dutch regulatory approval is imminent for trading in euro government bond and repurchase agreements at U.S. exchange CME\u2019s new Amsterdam hub to begin on March 18, the company said.  U.S. exchange Cboe also expects the regulatory green light imminently to shift euro denominated share trading from London to its new unit in the Dutch capital for April 1.  Trading platforms, essentially a heavily-regulated grouping of computer servers, are not major employers and therefore the number of jobs leaving London will not be large.  But a shift in trading could act as a magnet that drags other business like clearing and listings across the English Channel, Grob said.  Chunks of trading assets have already gone ahead.  The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) estimated in a 2017 report that lenders held 1.1 trillion euros ($1.2 trillion) of derivatives, stocks and bonds on their trading books in London on behalf of customers in the 27 states that will remain in the EU.  Consultancy EY said that 800 billion euros of assets had shifted from London to new banking hubs in the EU.  For the bulk of the money, the shift is expected to be permanent because the European Central Bank, the main supervisor of EU hubs, has made locating significant amounts of euro business in the bloc a condition in new licenses, bankers said.  Exchange officials also don\u2019t want to split trading in euro securities between the EU and London, which would create two, less efficient pools of liquidity.  \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s incremental steps but with every week and month, it will add up to a lot and it\u2019s one way,\u201d said Rob Boardman, head of European equities at broker ITG.  \u201cI\u2019ve not heard of EU trading platforms suddenly deciding they want to open a hub in the UK.\u201d  DUTCH SENSE  Brexit and competition to attract trading activity from London is pitting Amsterdam against Paris for the mantle of EU capital markets leader from a departing Britain.  Amsterdam, home to the world\u2019s first stock exchange and a trading nation for as long as Britain, is culturally aligned with the City of London financial district, Grob said.  Euro repo trading alone at the CME\u2019s new unit in Amsterdam will total about 200 billion euros a day.  \u201cIt made natural sense for us to go there,\u201d CME Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Duffy said.  Egged on by customers, LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange (LSE), has already moved clearing in euro repo trades totaling nearly 780 billion euros a day from London to its established Paris arm in a sign of how clearing is shifting too.  Cboe Europe, which accounts for over a fifth of daily pan-European share trading or 8 billion euros, will trade all European Economic Area listed stocks in Amsterdam from April 1.  Smaller rival Aquis Exchange, representing about 4 percent of pan-European stocks trading, intends to trade all its euro business in a new unit in Paris.  Interdealer broker TP ICAP is also opening an EU hub in Paris, and its iSwap fixed income business is setting up in Amsterdam. MarketAxess has a new hub in Amsterdam too, to trade credit in parallel with its London unit.  The LSE\u2019s Turquoise pan-European share trading platform, which has about 7 percent of the market, is opening an Amsterdam hub but will continue trading euro stocks in London if there is a Brexit deal, though much could hinge on where customers want to trade.  Britain\u2019s future trading relations with the EU will determine how much euro-denominated trading and clearing will eventually move to the EU, Grob said.  \u2018CITY SUR SEINE\u2019  French banks have mooted a \u201cCity sur Seine\u201d to reduce the EU\u2019s reliance on London and on banks for funding the economy, an ambition that one market veteran called \u201caspirational\u201d given investors\u2019 suspicion of France\u2019s tradition of interventionism.  But Arnaud de Bresson, head of Paris Europlace, which promotes the French capital as a financial center, said that while Paris would contribute \u201cenergetically\u201d to EU financial reform, it was also attuned to the needs of markets.  \u201cParis is already, after London, the top financial center in Europe for capital market activity. We are very close to the capital market culture,\u201d de Bresson said.  Banks also want Brussels to beef up efforts to build a deeper EU capital market as they face pressure from regulators to build up activity in their new hubs in the bloc.  \u201cIn light of Brexit, the CMU (capital markets union) project is more vital than ever for the EU to enhance and integrate its capital markets capacity and infrastructure,\u201d said Rick Watson, head of capital markets at AFME.","19":"* CME raises Comex 5000 Silver Futures margins by 17.9%  * U.S. commodities regulator monitoring silver markets activity  * One billion ounces of silver traded in London on Monday -LBMA (Adds context, updates prices)  Feb 2 (Reuters) - Silver fell more than 5% on Tuesday as a GameStop-style buying spree among small investors that took prices to a near eight-year peak appeared to fade following a margin hike by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  Spot silver fell 5.3% to $27.44 an ounce by 1320 GMT. On Monday it jumped 7.3% to its highest since February 2013 in the latest leg of a retail-driven buying frenzy in heavily shorted assets such as U.S. video game retailer GameStop .  CME Group raised maintenance margins on silver futures by 17.9% on Monday, a familiar move aimed at reducing unusual market stress, and posts on the WallStreetBets Reddit forum at the centre of the past week\u2019s action argued for traders to steer clear of the metal.  \u201cThe CME move is taking some froth off the market,\u201d said StoneX analyst Rhona O\u2019Connell. The correction was inevitable and in technical terms, silver is still overbought, she added.  Investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a note that a silver short squeeze is \u201cunattainable\u201d.  \u201cA co-ordinated surge in investment by retail traders into the silver market would simply raise volatility and generate small regional dislocations in supply-demand dynamics,\u201d the bank said.  The recent retail frenzy has left global dealers scrambling for bars and coins to meet demand, while also pushing the U.S. commodities regulator to monitor the market.  Meanwhile, the largest silver-backed exchange traded fund, the iShares Silver Trust, added about 20 million ounces of silver to its holdings on Monday, following a record inflow of about 34 million ounces on Friday.  Spot gold, meanwhile, fell 1.3% to $1,836.21 per ounce. U.S. gold futures shed 1.1% to $1,844.  Silver may weaken if gold does not move higher, HSBC analyst James Steel said in a note.  The current gold\/silver ratio is \u201cwell below historical averages, and investors may recognise this level as straying too far from historical norms\u201d.

FILE PHOTO: Gold bullions are displayed at Degussa shop in Singapore June 16, 2017. Picture taken June 16, 2017. REUTERS\/Edgar Su  Some bullion banks are no longer willing to hold large positions on Comex, the biggest gold futures market, after the coronavirus snarled the supply of gold bars, sending Comex prices vaulting above London rates in March.  The divergence wiped hundreds of millions of dollars off the value of trading books, according to industry sources, with HSBC reporting a $200 million paper loss in a single day.  Many banks have already reduced their day-to-day trading on Comex since the market disruption but they are worried that prices could diverge again and some now intend to reduce their open positions by between 50%-75%, sources at six lenders said.  Facing the threat of lost business, CME is considering amending contracts to allow delivery of gold in London as well as in New York, five industry and banking sources said, adding that no decision had yet been taken.  This would ease banks\u2019 concerns by removing the need to move gold from London to settle Comex contracts. But it would take months or years to implement and may not apply to the most traded contract, sources said, meaning it would not stop a reduction of positions in the short term.  They and the other sources declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media.  \u201cWe continue to work with market participants to evolve our offerings and continue to ensure our products deliver the most liquid, cost effective and transparent risk management tools,\u201d the CME said in a statement, adding that trading so far this year was higher than a year ago.  OPPORTUNITY FOR LONDON  HSBC, JPMorgan, UBS and other lenders use Comex futures to hedge their exposure to the gold market in London. Banks are the exchange\u2019s single biggest user group, accounting for more than a third of all Comex contracts.  At issue are contracts owned by the banks worth as much as $45 billion, equivalent to around 800 tonnes of gold, according to Comex data.  Traditionally, the London-Comex trade was a win-win as it gave banks a cheap and low-risk way to expand their trading books and gave typical Comex investors - such as hedge funds and asset managers - a bustling choice of banks to buy from.  But it relied on the ability of banks to quickly move gold from storage points in London to New York to settle contracts.  A withdrawal by the banks may take months.  Some banks will close contracts by buying them back, if prices on Comex fall below London rates. Some banks also plan to close positions in June when they can use gold they have shipped to New York to deliver against contracts, sources said.  Around 400 tonnes of eligible gold worth $22 billion has been shipped to Comex-registered vaults since late March, according to CME data.  (Graphic: Comex gold stocks - )  Some trading will move from Comex futures to the London over-the-counter (OTC) market, sources said.  Rival exchanges such as the London Metal Exchange (LME) could also pick up customers because banks still want to use a futures market.  \u201cThis is an opportunity for someone to step in,\u201d said a source at one of the biggest gold trading banks.  Both the London Metal Exchange and Intercontinental Exchange already offer futures contracts based on gold stored in London, but these are not widely traded.  LME Chief Executive Matt Chamberlain said there was increased interest from banks in its precious metals contracts. ICE did not respond to a request for comment.  Reuters asked 12 banks about their trading plans - HSBC, JPMorgan, UBS, Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Citi, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered, ICBC Standard and Bank of America  An HSBC spokesman said Comex remained one of many trading venues it and its clients use. The remainder either did not respond or declined to comment.  STILL THE BIGGEST  The disruption in March affected both markets.  Daily trading on Comex fell to around 25 million ounces last week from an average of 47 million in the year to March 23, when London and Comex prices moved apart, CME data show.  In London, daily trading was roughly 35 million ounces last week from an average of 40 million in the year to March 24, according to figures from the London Bullion Market Association and Nasdaq.  (Graphic: Gold trading volumes in London and on the Comex exchange - )  With fewer banks selling gold on Comex, investors are already paying more to maintain their positions. Every few months, investors exchange expiring futures contracts for ones with a later expiration. That would usually cost a couple of dollars an ounce. In recent days it has cost around $10-20.  Such a high price tag offers bigger profits for banks willing to trade, which will encourage some to keep trading on the exchange and close fewer positions, sources said.  Even with lower participation from banks, Comex, as the largest gold futures market, will likely remain dominant for the foreseeable future.  \u201cThere\u2019s no other alternative,\u201d said an industry source. \u201cWhere\u2019s the trading going to go?\u201d","23":"April 4 (Reuters) - CME Group Inc:  * CME GROUP AND GCSA CAPITAL COLLABORATE TO DELIVER THE PREFUNDED TREASURY FACILITY COLLATERAL PROGRAM FOR MEETING PERFORMANCE BOND REQUIREMENTS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","24":"LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Silver prices rocketed to their highest since 2013 on Monday after small investors responded to calls on Reddit and other social media to pile into the market and push prices up.  The move into silver came after the Reddit message board r\/WallStreetBets marshalled a surge of buying of companies including GameStop, forcing their shares up by hundreds of percent.  Silver has moved less dramatically - rising around 20% before falling back - in part because it is a larger and more complex market.  So how does silver trade?  OVER THE COUNTER  The biggest marketplace for physical silver (and gold) is London, where banks and brokers handle buy and sell orders from clients across the world.  Trading is done bilaterally over the counter (OTC) between financial institutions, and an investor must have a relationship with one of these to access the market.  The market is underpinned by bars of bullion which sit in the vaults of large banks such as JPMorgan and HSBC .  Around 660 million ounces of silver worth some $18 billion traded on average each day in the London market last week, according to the London Bullion Market Association.  FUTURES  Silver also trades on futures exchanges. The largest are the Shanghai Futures Exchange in China and CME Group\u2019s. Comex in New York, each of which host trading of around half a billion ounces of silver a day.  Futures are contracts in which the seller pledges to deliver silver to the buyer on a later date. They are typically traded through a broker.  Most futures are not held until delivery but swapped for later-dated ones. This allows both buyer and seller to speculate on the silver price without the trouble of moving and storing metal.  Another advantage of futures is that the holder need not pay the full amount for silver, but instead pays a fraction of its value, known as a margin.  EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS (ETFs)  ETFs trade on stock exchanges such as the NYSE and LSE alongside shares in publicly traded companies.  They store silver for their investors, with each share in the fund representing an amount of silver stored in a vault.  Small investors can trade shares in ETFs easily via apps such as Robinhood.  If demand for the ETF is strong enough to push the price above that of the underlying metal, more silver is moved into the vault to allow new shares to be created, moving the prices back into line.  The largest is the iShares Silver Trust, run by investment manager Blackrock, which contains around 620 million ounces of silver worth some $17 billion at current prices.  BARS AND COINS  Smaller investors can also buy silver bars and coins from retailers around the world.  Investors buy roughly 200 million ounces of silver bars and coins each year, accounting for about one fifth of total annual supply of silver, according to analysts Refinitiv Metals.  SILVER MINERS  Investors can also buy shares in companies that mine silver. Like ETFs, these are easy to trade on platforms like Robinhood.  Shares in these companies tend to rise and fall with silver prices, but many other factors such as the company\u2019s management, debt or performance also affect their value. (Reporting by Peter Hobson; Editing by Jan Harvey)","25":"LONDON (Reuters) - Direct access for Britain\u2019s financial sector to the European Union after Brexit is increasingly under threat as political will for an industry deal fades and the bloc toughens requirements for recognizing other countries\u2019 financial rules.  FILE PHOTO: A general view of The Shard and the financial district is seen in London, Britain, May 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay\/File Photo  The EU is the City\u2019s biggest customer, with financial services exports worth 26 billion pounds in 2017. Ensuring the UK\u2019s large financial industry could still operate across the bloc from its home base was one of the central issues during early divorce talks after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016.  But as the EU and Britain quashed the industry\u2019s hopes of largely unfettered access to the bloc, banks began moving around a trillion pounds of assets from London to new EU hubs, while trading worth around 240 billion euros a day in euro zone government bonds has moved to Milan and Amsterdam.  Despite the preparations, maintaining direct access would mean the sector could continue to leverage cross-border efficiencies of scale and avoid passing on the costs to customers of maintaining two hubs, one in Britain, the other in the EU.  Any access would be through \u201cequivalence\u201d - whereby the EU deems Britain\u2019s rules to be aligned closely enough to its own - but Brexit has already prompted Brussels to toughen up equivalence conditions.  \u201cYou can ask for whatever you like in equivalence, but the chance of the EU going down that line is zero until they decide they need it,\u201d said Sharon Bowles, a former chair of the European Parliament\u2019s economic affairs committee.  Equivalence is used by firms much further afield in the United States, Singapore and Japan, but was never designed for a whole global financial center on the EU\u2019s doorstep and does not cover core financial activities like banking.  The preparations already undertaken by financial institutions in the wake of the political impasse have to some degree lessened the need for alignment and some are keen to break free of what they consider restrictive rules.  UK insurance firms, for example, have long complained that EU capital rules are too inflexible, but despite pressure from lawmakers, the Bank of England has been loathe to make any unilateral changes while in the bloc.  \u201cI think that City opinion is more divided than a year ago on the merits of equivalence because of the reality of what it will look like in practice,\u201d said Jonathan Herbst, global head of financial services at Norton Rose Fulbright law firm.  Given that any EU-UK trade deal would likely be based on a series of compromises across all sectors, like fishing rights and autos, a divided but well resourced financial sector may give Britain\u2019s finance ministry less incentive to push for equivalence-based access to EU capital markets.  GOLDEN THREAD  Brussels has said it will grant temporary equivalence for the London Stock Exchange's LSE.L unit LCH to continue clearing euro derivatives until March next year to avoid disruption if there is a no-deal Brexit in October, something seen as more likely under Boris Johnson, who becomes Britain's Prime Minster on Wednesday.  That has helped London to retain the bulk of euro clearing, ironically the main thing that EU politicians said they wanted moved out of Britain after Brexit.  But it is unclear if that will be for the long term, or if there will be equivalence for investment services like trading stocks and bonds, which are regulated by EU MiFID securities rules.  \u201cInvestment services under MiFID is the golden thread that would allow you to keep sales in London,\u201d a fund industry official said.  The EU\u2019s markets watchdog has ruled that under a no-deal Brexit, euro shares must be traded inside the bloc, a signal that Brussels may want to deepen its own capital markets union by being tougher in granting equivalence.  Three UK-based pan-European platforms in London, Aquis AQX.L, Turquoise and Cboe CBOE.Z have already opened hubs in Amsterdam and Paris for EU customers to trade shares listed on other exchanges.  A hard Brexit would damage the prospects for equivalence by eroding goodwill in Brussels, said Nicolas Mackel, head of Luxembourg for Finance.  It could even prompt the bloc to review its temporary reprieve for euro clearing.  \u201cThe EU might very well decide that past derivatives inventories stay where they are, but mandate the clearing of all new business to the EU,\u201d said Xavier Rolet, former London Stock Exchange chief executive and now head of fund management firm CQS.  The decision by the EU to allow equivalence for the Swiss stock exchange to lapse last month showed markets can adapt to major changes without disruption, added Christian Voigt, senior regulatory advisor at trading software company Fidessa.  \u201cIt would be a step back for the City and increase costs for users, but it would not kill the industry,\u201d Voigt said.  It would be hard for the EU to suddenly cut off London when it comes to bond underwriting for companies and governments, said Simon Gleeson, a financial lawyer at Clifford Chance.  PIE IN THE SKY  The Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority of Britain have warned Britain must not become a permanent \u201ctaker\u201d of EU rules to obtain market access, tying the hands of UK regulators, a sentiment share by the government.  To mitigate this risk, Britain has called for the EU\u2019s equivalence system to be \u201cenhanced\u201d or made more transparent and predictable to make it more acceptable.  Bowles said it was \u201cpie in the sky\u201d to expect the EU to radically reform equivalence to Britain\u2019s liking in the short term.

FILE PHOTO: The Canary Wharf financial district is seen from the construction site of 22 Bishopsgate in London, Britain June 25, 2019. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay  Banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain currently have free rein in seeking customers, investors and markets across the EU, helping to maintain London\u2019s standing as a top global financial center.  But with Brexit potentially only two weeks away, it is not clear exactly how much EU access Britain\u2019s financial sector will be able to retain.  Britain and the EU are locked in talks on a divorce settlement they hope to conclude at an EU summit on Thursday.  Britain\u2019s parliament, due to hold a special session on Saturday, would have to endorse any deal.  These are the scenarios faced by financiers as the clock ticks down to Brexit Day on October 31:  THIRD EXTENSION  Britain has already extended its Brexit deadline twice to October 31. Another extension would allow the finance industry in Britain to maintain full access to the EU until a new Brexit date.  Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than ask for another extension. But parliament has passed a law requiring Britain to make a request for an extension if no deal is agreed.  More than 300 banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain have already opened new EU hubs to ensure continuity of service with European customers whatever form Brexit takes.  The two Brexit extensions have slowed down the relocation of jobs and activities, such as share trading, from London to new bases in the EU, despite pressure from EU regulators for Britain\u2019s financial firms to put more boots on the ground.  Another lengthy extension would be likely to put the brakes on the shifting of more business from London to EU centers such as Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Dublin.  A DEAL  A divorce settlement between Britain and the EU would mean business as usual for the financial sector during a fixed transition period.  An earlier draft withdrawal agreement included a transition phase until the end of 2020 to allow time for new trading arrangements between Britain and the EU to be slotted into place.  After this transition period, the EU has said that market access for Britain\u2019s financial sector would be based on the bloc\u2019s \u201cequivalence\u201d regime.  Under this system, Brussels grants direct access to EU markets if it deems that Britain\u2019s financial rules are aligned closely enough with those in the EU.  The process, which is also used by financial firms in Japan, Singapore and the United States, can be long and complex.  The EU has said that if there is a Brexit deal it could fast-track approval of UK equivalence in 2020 to avoid a gap in trading terms after the transition period ends.  But equivalence offers only patchy and unpredictable direct access, which is why so many UK-based firms have set up in the EU. And this has raised questions about how beneficial equivalence will be in practice.  Equivalence would also require Britain to stay aligned to EU rules when UK financial regulators do not want their hands tied.  British regulators do not want to become \u201crule takers\u201d, unable to diverge from EU regulations to tackle new risks that might develop in the UK\u2019s financial sector.  NO-DEAL  Failure to reach a Brexit deal this week, or a refusal to request an extension would potentially mean Britain crashes out of the EU, causing turmoil in financial markets.  There will not be a regulatory vacuum for banks, asset managers and insurers in Britain in a no-deal scenario because the government has put all existing EU rules into UK law.  But no deal would mean only limited direct access to the EU, and then largely via temporary measures, fragmenting markets and relationships built up over decades and raising costs for investors.  And a no-deal Brexit could delay equivalence decisions by Brussels, leaving Britain\u2019s financial sector more isolated from the EU.  Britain, the EU and EU member states have agreed that some cross-border financial activities like asset management and futures trading could continue for a time if there is no deal.  Britain will allow EU banks already operating in the UK to continue on a temporary basis until they obtain permanent authorization. But the EU has not reciprocated for UK banks operating in the bloc, meaning the lenders could face an overnight rupture in EU business.  Swapping personal data cross-border could be disrupted because the EU has yet to deem that standards in Britain for protecting privacy are \u201cadequate\u201d.  Without this, it could be illegal for an EU firm to do business with a UK counterpart if a customer\u2019s personal data is involved.  London is the main center for clearing financial instruments known as interest rate swaps denominated in euros, but under a no-deal Brexit this would end for EU customers in March 2020.  After March next year, customers would then have to shift trillions of euros in contracts from London unless the EU agreed to a clearing extension.  Swathes of trading in euro-denominated shares in London could move to new platforms that have set up in Amsterdam and Paris to ensure continued EU access.  European government bond trading has already moved, but London would retain its dominance in spot currency trading because this market is not regulated.","31":"(Recasts, adds Shanghai Futures Exchange comment)  SHANGHAI\/LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) plans to launch a copper contract next year that will open the door to foreign investors wanting to hedge exposure in China, the Shanghai Futures Exchange said on Monday.  China is the top global consumer of raw materials and has some of the world\u2019s most liquid commodities futures markets, but foreign companies have limited access to these markets.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE), which owns INE, currently offers a copper futures contract, but it is not open to foreign participation and is subject to value-added and import taxes.  \u201cThe ShFE Copper contract in many ways is the regional benchmark in Southeast Asia. However, firms without onshore China representation were unable to hedge into the market,\u201d said John Browning, managing director at Hong Kong-based broker BANDS Financial.  \u201cThe INE copper contract ... solves this problem. A marginal loss in hedging volume on the LME and CME might be offset by a huge increase in cross-border arbitrage.\u201d  The London Metal Exchange and CME Group offer investors and hedgers liquid copper contracts.  \u201cThe bonded copper futures will be traded on the basis of \u2018international platform, net pricing, bonded physical delivery and RMB denomination\u2019 and directly open to overseas investors,\u201d ShFE said, referring to the yuan-denominated contract.  The exchange gave no further detail, but a source close to the matter said the contract will be both cash and physically settled against copper stored at bonded warehouses in Shanghai and that no taxes will be levied in an effort to attract foreign investors.  Contract size and launch date have yet to be decided, the source added.  BANDS Financial, however, said that INE aims to launch the contract in the second quarter of 2020.  \u201cThe target clients are domestic trading companies, state-owned enterprises and clients located in Southeast Asia who are currently using the LME or CME to hedge,\u201d it said in a note.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Ether, which has long lived in bitcoin\u2019s shadow, is the digital currency or token that facilitates transactions on the ethereum blockchain. In the crypto world, the terms ether and ethereum have become interchangeable.  While bitcoin is the preferred store of value in the digital ecosystem, ethereum has emerged as the leading financial infrastructure, settling more than $12 billion in daily transactions, according to digital asset manager GrayScale\u2019s latest report.  The CME listing allows investors to diversify crypto holdings outside of bitcoin and provides an avenue for investors to hedge their ethereum exposure, opening a market where bearish positions on the asset can be readily expressed.  Ether futures, which follow those of bitcoin\u2019s listing in December 2017, will be cash-settled and will be priced based on a CME reference rate that draws data from major cryptocurrency exchanges Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit, and Kraken.  Investors don\u2019t expect huge volumes out of the gate, much like when bitcoin futures launched three years ago, but the asset should gain traction as an easy way to get access to another crypto-based network, said John Wu, president of AVA Labs, an open-source platform for creating financial applications using blockchain technology.  \u201cThis will introduce new people and organizations to crypto and to the programmable smart contract side of the ecosystem, rather than just a store of value and digital gold,\u201d Wu added.  Smart contracts are self-executing transactions.  Ethereum hit a record high of $1,764.55 on Friday, ahead of its futures launch, which helped boost the crypto sector\u2019s market cap to about $1.2 trillion, according to data tracker CoinGecko.com. It was last up 8% at $1,729.59.  (Graphic: Ethereum on the rise: )  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was up 2.5% at $37,892. It hit a record high of $42,000 on Jan. 8.  Since the launch of bitcoin futures three years ago, the CME has noted significant growth in their adoption from a broad array of participants, including institutional investors.  Since the beginning of 2020, a total of 8,560 CME bitcoin futures contracts, equivalent to about 42,800 bitcoins, have traded on average per day, the CME said in a statement. Institutional interest has also increased, with the number of large open interest holders reaching a record of 110 in December.  The latest CME data also showed bitcoin\u2019s net shorts of 2,781 contracts last week were the smallest since late November.  (Graphic: Bitcoin futures vs asset price: )  JP Morgan in a research note suggested that ether futures\u2019 listing could be followed by a fall in the price of the underlying currency, much like what happened when bitcoin futures started trading. The new contracts will enable holders of physical ethereum to hedge their exposure.  Global investors have started pouring cash into ethereum funds and products, with about $56.1 million in inflows in January, according to a report on institutional flows from digital currency manager CoinShares. Bitcoin remains the recipient of the bulk of overall investor flows or 92%, equivalent to nearly $2 billion in January.

No matter what form Brexit takes, it will cause a big shift of financial activity from London to other financial centres in the EU, the paper said. It called for more action to make sure the bloc remains one of the world\u2019s two top financial centres, even without London.  \u201cIrrespective of the precise shape of future relations following the Brexit, non-automatic access from London will result in a significant shift of financial services activities to the EU 27 that will be spread across several financial centres,\u201d the paper said.  It proposed a rebranding of the bloc\u2019s plans to build a capital markets union (CMU), a process that was launched five years ago but has so far seen only patchy progress despite several new laws and a reboot.  The impending departure of Britain, by far the biggest capital market in the bloc, has made the task more pressing. London dominates in derivatives, currencies and pan-European shares, and is expected to compete hard to keep that business even after Brexit.  The paper, published by Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland on the sidelines of meetings of euro zone and EU finance ministers in Luxembourg, called for the CMU to be renamed the \u201cSavings and Sustainable Investment Union\u201d, to win more support from a public wary of speculative markets.  It proposes a \u201cpriority shift\u201d to help consumers turn savings into investments, and ensure that the EU remains \u201cone of the top two financial centres of the world\u201d after Brexit.  The focus for \u201cmassively\u201d developing equity markets should be on venture capital and private equity, and creating a non-profit \u201cconsolidated tape\u201d that links all trading platforms to make share trading cheaper.  There is also a need to develop debt, credit and foreign exchange financing tools - core strengths of London\u2019s financial centre - in a manner that \u201cincreases the international funding currency role of the euro\u201d, the paper said.  There is already a battle between UK and EU regulators over where euro-denominated shares can be traded by investors for the bloc after Brexit.  A push to deepen EU equity markets could mean Britain\u2019s market players encounter obstacles when trying to gain access to EU investors after Brexit.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Hong Kong and London are both financial centres racked by political turmoil. But months of violent protest in the Chinese territory and parliamentary disarray in Britain are no obstacles to Charles Li\u2019s hopes of combining the two cities\u2019 stock exchanges. The chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing on Wednesday unveiled a plan to buy London Stock Exchange Group for $37 billion in cash and shares. It\u2019s a last-ditch attempt to prevent his target from escaping.  The LSE is used to takeover interest: It has on average received a bid every 2.5 years since it listed in 2000, according to Berenberg analysts. The latest proposal has a greater urgency. LSE Chief Executive David Schwimmer turned predator last month, agreeing to buy financial information purveyor Refinitiv for $27 billion. If completed that deal would put the LSE beyond the reach of HKEX, which has a market value of almost $40 billion.  HKEX\u2019s bid therefore depends on LSE shareholders rejecting the Refinitiv takeover. The Hong Kong exchange\u2019s offer of 83.61 pounds per LSE share is enough to make them think twice. That is 23% above LSE\u2019s closing price on Tuesday, and a stonking 47% more than the shares were worth before news of the Refinitiv deal broke in July.  The HKEX\u2019s announced plan has several shortcomings, though. Li offered few details about how the company will justify a valuation of 26 times LSE\u2019s expected EBITDA this year, according to forecasts compiled by Refinitiv. His grand vision of creating a global entity connecting east and west is no substitute for spelling out specific cost savings, or new revenue that the combined group could capture. As three-quarters of the value of HKEX\u2019s offer is in the form of its own shares, the reaction of the company\u2019s own investors will be crucial.  British authorities may also intervene. Li on Wednesday hailed Britain\u2019s openness to foreign ownership, as evidenced by HKEX\u2019s acquisition of the London Metal Exchange in 2012. Prime Minister Boris Johnson might well see the offer as a vote of confidence in Britain. But his opponents are bound to accuse him of letting the bourse fall into the hands of a company which based in a territory that is increasingly under the influence of mainland Chinese authorities. Regulators will also be nervous about anything that unsettles London\u2019s financial infrastructure when rivals in continental Europe are circling.  Finally, the prospect of a takeover might also prompt long-standing suitors like CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange to join the fight. If HKEX is to end LSE\u2019s independence, it still has many hurdles to clear.","36":"LONDON (Reuters) - More than one hundred asset managers, trading platforms and investment firms in London have so far obtained licences to run new hubs in the European Union after Brexit, a top EU regulator said on Thursday.

CBOE CBOE.Z will offer trading in EU shares at its new Amsterdam hub from October to replicate its London unit, with rival exchange Aquis AQX.L set to follow suit at a new Paris unit.  Maijoor said such preparations for Brexit were largely an issue for the private sector.  Paris-based ESMA directly authorises and supervises credit rating agencies and trade repositories in the EU.  \u201cThere we have seen good progress on getting prepared for the risk of a no-deal Brexit,\u201d Maijoor said.  The likelihood of a no-deal Brexit began to recede this week as Britain\u2019s parliament approves a law to stop this from happening.  There has been concern in the funds industry that a no-deal Brexit would threaten a long-standing global practice known as delegation, whereby asset managers outside the EU can pick stocks for funds listed in the bloc.  Asset managers in London worried they would be under pressure to move to the EU.  \u201cThe EU27 do support the possibility for delegation because it\u2019s a generic way for global capital markets to work,\u201d Maijoor said.  \u201cOn the other hand, it must not undermine the possibility to have a fully-fledged entity in the EU27 and not a shell company, and an entity that can be supervised.\u201d  ESMA, national regulators and Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority have already signed cooperation agreements in the event of a no-deal Brexit, he added.

The NYSE is the only U.S. exchange that still operates stock trading floors alongside electronic trading. It released a study on Thursday showing that floor traders dampen volatility by providing tighter bid-offer spreads, especially at the market close, saving investors millions of dollars a day.  While the floor distinguishes NYSE from its competitors, the closure has not led to a significant drop in market share, according to an analysis released Friday by industry trade group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.  \u201cOnly time will tell if investors feel the difference in execution of their trades with or without the human interaction on the floor,\u201d the study said.  The NYSE plans to reopen its San Francisco-based options floor on Monday. It has not given a date for the reopening of its iconic floors at 11 Wall Street.  CME, which runs the world\u2019s largest futures exchange, said on Wednesday it was unclear when it would reopen its trading floors, where about 10% of its business was done.  \u201cWe will not do anything irrational either way until we know exactly where health officials and government officials are going to come down as far as multiple people getting together in a single location,\u201d CEO Terry Duffy told analysts on a call.  The closure had little effect on trading activity, CME said.  \u201cParticipants can trade any strategy today as easily as they could prior to the closure of the floor,\u201d said Sean Tully, a senior managing director at the exchange.

FILE PHOTO: Men enter the CME Group offices in New York, U.S., October 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  CME Group CME.O, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade, said this week that most of the pits it closed in March because of the pandemic will remain shuttered indefinitely. The news disappointed some brokers who hoped to return to the trading floor this month and are looking for other ways to make money.  McGathey Commodities President Virginia McGathey, who trades in grain options pits, said her income dropped about 90% since the shutdown. Her customers are executing orders for themselves, instead of coming to her, because she can no longer offer an advantage of being on the floor.  \u201cThe powers that be, in my opinion, were moving to try to get the floor closed,\u201d McGathey said.  A CME spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the company intends to shut any trading pits permanently.  Open-outcry trading was a raucous tradition in which traders jostled and screamed to execute orders in pits packed with people. CME closed most futures pits in 2015 due to the rise of computerized trading, although more than 20 products like Eurodollar and grain options were still traded in pits.  The Eurodollar options pit will reopen on Aug. 10 with a reconfiguration to allow for social distancing, while all others will stay closed until Chicago and Illinois move into the final stages of their economic reopening plans, CME said. That will not occur until there is a COVID-19 vaccine, a treatment that ensures adequate healthcare capacity or a sustained period without new cases of the virus, according to the state.  CME must be cautious about reopening pits because social distancing is impossible, Chief Executive Terry Duffy told investors last month.  The London Metal Exchange\u2019s open outcry trading floor may also remain closed for many more months because it cannot reopen under social distancing restrictions.  CME has a rule that it will keep pits alive as long as they account for 30% of total trading volume. Eurodollar options are the only product that meets the threshold, Duffy said.  Floor brokers said health risks appear lower in the grain pits because they are less crowded than Eurodollars.  CME\u2019s shutdown has pushed customers away from complex options trades the pits specialize in, the brokers said. The company said all strategies from the floor are being used electronically.  Agricultural brokerage Futures International will likely scale back its presence on the floor when and if CME reopens pits because floor employees have transitioned well to working in an office, President Gary Sandlund said.  \u201cThe longer that we go without a trading floor, people adapt and get comfortable with a new way of getting things done,\u201d Sandlund said.  \u201cSadly it\u2019s likely that it\u2019s the end of a 180-year era.\u201d","41":"* CME raises Comex 5000 Silver Futures margins by 17.9%  * U.S. commodities regulator monitoring silver activity  * Billion ounces of silver traded in London on Monday - LBMA  * FACTBOX-How silver is traded (Updates prices)  Feb 2 (Reuters) - Silver slid more than 8% on Tuesday as small investors retreated after a rally to a near eight-year peak the previous session fuelled by a social media-driven trading frenzy.  Spot silver fell 8.2% to $26.59 an ounce by 1:54 p.m. EST (1854 GMT). On Monday, it surged 7.3% to its highest since February 2013.  \u201cIt appears that the attempted short squeeze by the smaller retail traders has at least temporarily failed,\u201d said Kitco Metals senior analyst Jim Wyckoff, adding retail investors were looking for other markets to impact.  Contributing to the pullback, the CME Group raised maintenance margins on silver futures by 17.9% on Monday to tackle unusual market volatility. Also, posts on the WallStreetBets Reddit forum at the centre of the last week\u2019s action encouraged traders to steer clear of silver.  \u201cIf these Reddit investors are going to try to squeeze the silver market, they\u2019re going to have to do it this week, otherwise it\u2019s going to be a flash in the pan,\u201d Kitco\u2019s Wyckoff said.  The market gyrations invited scrutiny from the U.S. commodities regulator.  \u201cA coordinated surge in investment by retail traders into the silver market would simply raise volatility and generate small regional dislocations in supply-demand dynamics,\u201d Goldman Sachs said in a note.  The largest silver-backed exchange traded fund, the iShares Silver Trust, added about 20 million ounces of silver to its holdings on Monday, following a record inflow of about 34 million ounces on Friday.

Derivatives are widely used by companies to hedge themselves against unexpected moves in borrowing costs or prices for raw materials.  \u201cMarket participants can be confident that the clearing and trading of derivatives between the UK and U.S. will maintain the high standards of today when the UK leaves the EU,\u201d Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in a statement.  Currently, derivatives trading in Britain conforms to rules written by the European Union, the trading bloc that the United Kingdom is due to leave on March 29.  U.S. and UK regulators told reporters on Monday that the trading and clearing of derivatives transactions in London and New York, two markets that dominate the global sector, would continue under a similar set of rules once Brexit takes place.  With just over a month to go, it is still unclear if Britain will leave the EU with a transition agreement, or crash out with no deal.  The steps announced by the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Monday aim to reassure markets that derivatives will not be disrupted even if there is a \u201chard\u201d Brexit.  CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo said the measures provide a \u201cbridge over Brexit\u201d through a durable regulatory framework which the thriving trans Atlantic derivatives market may continue and endure.  The measures were yet \u201canother example of the special relationship between our two countries\u201d, Britain\u2019s finance minister Philip Hammond said. (Reporting by Huw Jones and David Milliken,)","45":"LONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - How the United States supervises cross-border derivatives is flawed and needs resetting to avoid fragmenting markets and placing undue burden on companies, a top U.S. regulator said on Tuesday.  In a speech that will be widely seen as targeting the European Union, Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said the agency was guilty of overreach by regulating firms that are not based in the United States but do business with U.S. customers.  This \u201coverly expansive, unduly complex\u201d approach has shown insufficient deference to other countries even though they comply with the same international standards applied in the United States.  The CFTC will soon publish a \u201cWhite Paper\u201d setting out a more thoughtful \u201cnext act\u201d for regulating the cross border swaps market, Giancarlo told an audience in London\u2019s financial district.  \u201cIn a number of areas, the White Paper will recognise deficiencies in the CFTC\u2019s current approach to regulating cross-border activities and seek to recalibrate the CFTC\u2019s cross-border approach based on a set of guiding principles,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe CFTC should pursue multilateralism, not unilateralism for swaps reforms that are designed to mitigate systemic risk,\u201d he said.  The next version of CFTC cross-border rules would focus better on addressing actual systemic risks from foreign firms to the U.S. financial system, and leave supervision of trading practices and market structures like clearing houses to their home supervisor, Giancarlo said.  This pledge follows CFTC criticism of a draft EU law that would give EU regulators a role in supervising U.S. based clearing houses that service customers in the bloc, encroaching on the CFTC\u2019s turf.  Giancarlo has said it should be amended to avoid harm to U.S. businesses, saying the EU should defer to the CFTC when it comes to supervising American clearing houses.  BREXIT BOOST?  Giancarlo said an approach based on deference when it comes to margin, trading venues, clearing houses, or other areas, is essential to ensuring a strong and stable derivatives market that supports economic growth both within and outside the United States.  The call for a \u201cdeference\u201d-based approach between regulators from different countries will be welcomed by Britain in its bid to maintain London as Europe\u2019s biggest centre for clearing euro-denominated derivatives after leaving the EU next March.  France has said large chunks of euro clearing should move to the euro zone after Brexit so that EU regulators can supervise the activity properly.  Britain says this is not necessary as it will still be complying with the same international financial rules as those enforced in the bloc.  Giancarlo did not elaborate on what the CFTC would do if a foreign regulator failed to reciprocate U.S. deference.","46":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 but so far has no exit agreement with the bloc to ensure an orderly departure.  FILE PHOTO - A man takes a photograph of the Canary Wharf financial district from Greenwich Park in London, Britain, January 22, 2017. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay  London is Europe\u2019s biggest financial center, with the EU its top export market, meaning that without contingency arrangements markets, banking, asset management and insurance across Europe would be left in chaos.  But preparations are underway on both sides of the Channel to avoid the worst effects of any no-deal Brexit.  TEMPORARY WORKAROUNDS  Britain is approving a law that would allow branches of EU banks and insurers in Britain to continue serving UK customers, giving them time to apply for permanent authorization.  After the EU refused to reciprocate to cover British banks doing business with European clients, EU states have begun taking unilateral action.  Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg, Ireland and Norway are planning to allow UK financial firms to keep undertaking limited business for a fixed period of time after March if there is no deal, giving breathing space for new EU banking and insurance hubs to get bedded down.  British and EU regulators have agreed pacts to exchange information and cooperate on supervision in the event of a no-deal Brexit to avoid immediate disruption to cross-border activity in derivatives clearing, credit ratings agencies, trade reporting venues and asset management.  WHAT ARE THE BANKS UP TO?  Many international banks use London as their European base but with the possibility of a hard Brexit in the short term, and the likelihood of patchy EU access from Britain in future, they are moving to open hubs in the bloc by March 29.  The banks, which trade stocks, bonds, repos and derivatives, are moving 800 billion pounds of assets to make their new hubs in Frankfurt and Paris operational by next month, according to consultancy EY.  The new hubs will be allowed to continue booking some trades centrally in London for now, on condition they build up activities and staffing within their new operations over the next few years.  LLOYD\u2019S OF BRUSSELS  Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance market has opened a Brussels subsidiary to write European policies and avoid potential disruption to EU customers.  Insurers like AIG are shifting blocks of policies from EU customers to new hubs in the EU to become Brexit-proof by March.  EU insurance watchdog EIOPA has calculated there are 9 million customers across Europe still facing potential disruption to policies worth a collective 7.4 billion euros if there is a no-deal Brexit, but say that is not likely to threaten financial stability and require EU contingency action.  DERIVATIVES ON ICE?  ICE Futures in London is one of Europe\u2019s two main derivatives exchanges - the other is Eurex in Frankfurt.  Unlike stock and bond trading platforms, ICE has no plans to shift trading to the continent. Instead it is obtaining permission from individual EU states like Germany and the Netherlands to allow customers there to continue trading on ICE in London.  Banks are shifting some outstanding derivatives contracts for EU customers from London to new hubs in the bloc.  DELEGATION WINS A REPRIEVE  Asset managers in Britain feared that a no-deal Brexit would stop them from managing funds listed in Luxembourg, Dublin and elsewhere in Europe, a cross-border activity known as delegation.  But regulators from Britain and the EU agreed a pact this month to share information in the event of a no-deal Brexit to allow delegation to continue, triggering a huge sigh of relief in the sector. [nL5N1ZV5A7]  SHARES GOING DUTCH  London-based Cboe Europe, the biggest pan-European stock exchange, is opening a new hub in Amsterdam to which its trading in euro-denominated shares will move from the start of April, irrespective of what sort of Brexit is agreed.  London Stock Exchange\u2019s pan-European Turquoise platform is also opening a hub in Amsterdam by the end of March and could move trading in euro-denominated shares there.  Aquis is opening a new hub in Paris to which it will move its euro-denominated share trading. Shifting trading could be followed by a similar relocation in some clearing to EuroCCP in the Netherlands.  Cutting off Britain would, however, disrupt the operation of EU rules that ensure transparency in share trading.  EURO BONDS AND REPOS RETURN TO THEIR ROOTS  CME-owned BrokerTec, a bond and repurchase agreement (repo) trading platform, is moving its 210 billion-a-day euro-denominated trading to a new Amsterdam hub by March 18 to avoid splitting liquidity, even if there is a Brexit deal.  Likewise, MTS will shift Italian bond trading from London to Italy.  SPOT STAYS BUT FORWARDS FLEE  Spot forex trading is set to stay in London even if there is a no-deal Brexit.  But CME unit EBS is moving foreign-exchange forwards and swaps trading from London to Amsterdam by March 18, even if there is a Brexit deal.  Likewise, Refinitiv is transferring its $300 billion-a-day forex derivatives trading to Dublin from London, while leaving its $100 billion-a-day spot trading in London.  METALS IN FINE FETTLE FOR NOW  The London Metal Exchange has applied to German and Dutch regulators for dispensation from the requirement to be licensed as a foreign trading venue so that customers in those two countries can continue using the UK-based platform for trading copper, aluminum and other metals.  No such license is required in France, Cyprus, Ireland or Norway.  The EU has said if there is no deal, customers in the bloc could continue clearing their metals trades on LME for up to a year.  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE EURO CLEARING EXODUS?  London dominates euro-denominated derivatives clearing but it would be impossible to shift trillions of euros of contracts to the continent by March to avoid disruption from a no-deal Brexit that could threaten financial stability.  Brussels has acknowledged this by saying that in the event of a hard Brexit it would allow EU customers to continue using UK-based clearing houses like LCH until the end of 2020 to give more time to shift positions, and for rival clearers like Eurex in Frankfurt to build up capacity.  EU securities regulators and the Bank of England have also agreed a cooperation pact for supervising cross-border clearing operations.","47":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fixed income trading platform Tradeweb Markets TW.O on Thursday reported record volumes in the third quarter as market volatility driven by the U.S.-China trade war and global rate cuts bolstered activity during the normally sluggish summer months.  Average daily volume across all asset classes was $815 billion in the last quarter, a 53.3% increase from the same period a year ago. The gains were partly driven by its interest rates business, which was up 64.5% year over year.  Tradeweb is majority owned by Refinitiv. Thomson Reuters, the parent of Reuters News, holds a stake in Refinitiv.  The other main fixed-income-only trading platform, MarketAxess MKTX.O, earlier this month reported average daily trading volume of $8.25 billion for the third quarter and $8.76 billion for September, up 35% and 22.43% from the same period in 2018 respectively.  Trading desks are typically quieter in July and August as market participants go on holiday. But this year the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 in July, then again in September; the U.S.-China trade war persisted and began to weaken U.S. economic data; and political stability was threatened from Hong Kong to Britain to Iran.  While trading volumes have been generally elevated this year, the surge in the third quarter has been notable, said Kevin McPartland, managing director, market structure and technology, at Greenwich Associates.  \u201cVolatility is effectively driving volume, which is driving volatility,\u201d he said.  While other exchanges did not report overall monthly or quarterly records, volumes still rose dramatically from prior years. CME Group CME.O averaged 20.2 million contracts in all asset classes per day in Q3, up 30% from a year ago. Intercontinental Exchange ICE.N reported a 12% year-on-year rise in average daily volume.  Top-line growth at companies like Tradeweb has surged as fixed-income trading has begun to move online, a transition equities traders made in the 1990s. Capitalizing in part on this shift, Tradeweb went public in April of this year and its share price has since risen 16%.  Tradeweb and MarketAxess have benefited from both the overall rise in market trading volumes and the increased proportion that is being conducted electronically.  \u201cAs recently as five years ago, when markets got volatile, the buy side\u2019s inclination when executing a trade was to move away from the screen and pick up the phone. That approach has shown signs of reversing,\u201d said McPartland.

This \u201ctime-limited\u201d access will avoid severe disruption to over-the-counter or OTC derivatives worth trillions of euros that are cleared at LCH in London.  WHY TIME-LIMITED?  It increases leverage for the EU, which wants a deeper capital market that relies less on the City of London.  The bulk of clearing in privately traded or OTC euro-denominated interest rate swaps for EU investors is done in London and there is little sign of this changing substantially anytime soon. Time-limited access allows clearers inside the EU to build up their capacity to take over from London. A deadline would put pressure on banks to move positions from London to the euro zone.  HOW MUCH EURO CLEARING HAS MOVED SO FAR?  LCH says nothing discernible. Deutsche Boerse\u2019s Eurex, the only EU-based clearer of euro swaps of note, said it has around 19 trillion euros of outstanding notional value in rate swaps and forward rate agreements. Eurex has 7.3 trillion euros purely in swaps compared to LCH\u2019s 45.8 trillion euros. Eurex has an overall target of 25 trillion euros or a quarter of the market by the end of this year.  WHAT\u2019S INVOLVED IN A MOVE FROM LONDON?  Banks would have to close out or sell their swaps positions worth billions of euros in London and open new positions in Eurex. It is a costly and complex transaction that can take several hours or longer and leave the seller in a potentially vulnerable situation. There is no mechanism for shifting such huge positions in a short time.  CAN THE EU GET ALL OF THE EURO MARKET?  No, because only a portion is transacted between EU based counterparties, the sub-sector the bloc\u2019s regulators can realistically target. LCH is likely to remain the clearer for euro swaps traded between non-EU counterparties.  WILL LONDON GET ACCESS FOR THE LONGER TERM?  Most likely. It would be hard for the EU to shut off LCH completely given that it already allows clearers in the United States like CME and ICE to serve EU customers. In return for access, Britain has to allow the EU to jointly supervise LCH until it no longer clears a \u201csystemic\u201d amount of euro trades, a politically sensitive requirement. Otherwise Brussels could force EU investors to use an EU or another non-British clearer it approves of.","50":"CHICAGO, July 2 (Reuters) - During the first three months in which the CME Group allowed privately negotiated \u201cblock trades\u201d in agricultural futures and options, 75 percent of those trades occurred in highly liquid nearby contracts, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in a report on Monday.  That trend runs contrary to grain industry expectations for block trades, which the CME Group Inc, parent of the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, began allowing in markets such as corn and wheat in January.  The CME has said it expanded block trading in agricultural products to boost trade in thinly traded markets, including contracts for deferred delivery.  Yet the CFTC found the bulk of block trades were executed in front contract months, which are typically the most actively traded agricultural futures and options.  \u201cThe use of block trades in liquid contracts appears to conflict with the expectations set by the CME,\u201d the CFTC\u2019s report said.  \u201cThe industry concern is that block trades are pulling volume from liquid contracts,\u201d the report said.  However, the CFTC found no rule violation in nearby block trades, and said after reviewing CME grain and livestock trading data from Jan. 8 to March 31 that block trades complied with CME rules requiring trades to be executed at a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d price.  The CFTC said it would continue to monitor block trades for examples of lost liquidity in nearby contracts, and for block prices falling outside the normal trade range.  A CME spokesman had no immediate comment on the CFTC\u2019s report.  CME executives discussed block trades in a meeting with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue last week during which they said they were holding periodic talks on the topic with the National Grain and Feed Association, a trade group that represents commercial grain handlers.  Block trades are struck away from the exchange, sometimes outside of regular trading hours, but still cleared by the exchange. Proponents say the transactions help them execute large orders without disrupting prices in thinly traded markets.  Some brokers oppose block trades, saying they unfairly allow big players to trade in secret, bypassing the open market.  \u201cThis is the exchange catering to the big managed money accounts, and the traditional players are not relevant to them,\u201d said Scott Hedin, an independent grain trader.  Block trades represent an extremely small portion of CME\u2019s overall trading volume in agricultural products, the CFTC said, although its analysis showed volume can be \u201csomewhat more significant on specific dates and for certain contract months.\u201d (Reporting by Julie Ingwersen; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)","51":"(Updates headline, byline; updates closing prices)  CHICAGO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. soybean and corn futures climbed to fresh 6-1\/2 year highs on Wednesday, as worries about dry weather hurting Argentine crops attracted speculative buyers, analysts said.

FILE PHOTO: The name of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited is displayed at the entrance in Hong Kong, China January 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Bobby Yip\/File Photo  The unsolicited takeover offer is not expected to succeed given a preference among LSE investors for the exchange to complete its $27 billion proposed acquisition of data and analytics group Refinitiv, the source close to the LSE said.  The exchange wants to focus on executing that deal, rather than risk it being derailed by the Hong Kong bourse, the source said. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing's (HKEX) 0388.HK offer requires the LSE to ditch the Refinitiv purchase.  But a person close to the Hong Kong exchange said a rejection of an initial approach was common in takeovers and HKEX was already considering its next step. Informal discussions between HKEX and LSE shareholders have begun, the person added.  The Financial Times reported on Thursday that HKEX was open to considering a higher element of cash in its offer, citing a person familiar with the matter.  An LSE spokeswoman declined to comment.  The proposed deal, announced on Wednesday, aims to create an exchange powerhouse spanning Asia, Europe and the United States which would be better able to compete with U.S. rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N and CME Group Inc CME.O.  However shares in HKEX fell more than 3% on Thursday as investors raised concerns about the political and regulatory risks involved in its move to take over one of Britain\u2019s marquee financial institutions.  The UK government said authorities would examine the proposed deal closely as the LSE was a \u201ccritically important part\u201d of the British financial system.  However a takeover could face regulatory scrutiny beyond British shores; the London bourse also owns the Milan exchange and has a significant American presence through its FTSE Russell index subsidiary and LCH, its derivatives clearing house which dominates the U.S. dollar swap market.  This means a deal could also draw the attention of watchdogs in Italy and the United States, which is locked in a trade war with China.  HKEX declined to comment.  The Hong Kong exchange\u2019s indicative offer for the LSE also received a cool reception in London, where LSE shares finished up 5.9% on Wednesday, far short of the proposed takeover\u2019s implied premium.  Another major sticking point is the requirement for the LSE to abandon its acquisition of financial information provider Refinitiv from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc BX.N and Thomson Reuters Corp TRI.TO, the parent of Reuters News.  That deal, which went public in late July, caused LSE\u2019s shares to leap 15% on hopes Refinitiv\u2019s business would boost its long-term profitability. LSE said in a statement on Wednesday that it remained committed to the Refinitiv deal.  HKEX has 28 days to make a firm bid for the LSE, whose shares closed up nearly 1% at 7,274 pence on Thursday or walk away for six months.  The source close to the LSE said that while the Hong Kong deal offered a gateway into China\u2019s economy, the LSE had already established its own entry point with a recently launched stock market link with Shanghai.  PROTESTS AND POLITICAL RISK  Analysts said a perception that Beijing is exerting growing influence over Hong Kong could become another key sticking point for an LSE takeover, given the Hong Kong government\u2019s close links with the HKEX.  Fitch Ratings said that \u201cincreasing control by Chinese authorities over Hong Kong\u201d could raise regulatory concerns in Britain and the United States about data and information security.  Hong Kong is entering a fourth month of sometimes violent protests sparked by legislation that would have drawn the former British colony closer to the Chinese legal system.  The government\u2019s handling of the protests has been criticized internationally, as has the political pressure applied by Beijing to Hong Kong companies not to support the pro-democracy movement.  \u201cThe transaction will require various regulatory approvals, which will stress-test the world\u2019s understanding of Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 constitution,\u201d said David Blennerhassett, an independent analyst writing on the SmartKarma research platform.  The Hong Kong government is the biggest shareholder in HKEX, with a 6% stake. It approves six of the 13 board members and can also stop any other shareholding rising above 5%.  Four U.S.-based lawyers said it was possible the deal would qualify for a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which assesses transactions for national security concerns, including critical infrastructure.  While this has traditionally been thought of as utilities, telecommunications and transportation, key financial market infrastructure could meet this classification, one lawyer said.  \u201cHong Kong is changing and its government is increasingly under the thumb of Beijing,\u201d said one of the lawyers, Dave Hanke, a partner at Arent Fox.  \u201cSo, if CFIUS does review the deal, it would likely treat the Hong Kong exchange the same as it would a mainland Chinese entity,\u201d added Hanke, who helped craft the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, legislation due to be implemented next year which aims to beef up CFIUS\u2019 oversight powers.  The U.S. Treasury said it could not comment on whether CFIUS would review the proposed deal.  Even if the deal does not qualify for CFIUS review, it could fall foul of broader political concerns in Washington over the role of Chinese companies in the U.S. economy.  In February 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission blocked the sale of the Chicago Stock Exchange to a group led by China-based investors, citing a lack of information on the would-be buyers and how the deal would impact its ability to monitor the exchange.  That deal was approved by CFIUS but had been strongly criticized by U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of its nixing.  The United States has also leant on foreign allies in the past to spike deals it felt could indirectly affect its security, including German chip equipment maker Aixtron AIXGn.DE in 2016. American authorities have in recent months openly campaigned against Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] from installing 5G infrastructure in countries around the world.  In Italy, the ruling 5-Star Movement said it would closely monitor HKEX\u2019s move to ensure any development did not harm national interests. The LSE owns Italy\u2019s stock exchange.  Analysts said HKEX\u2019s share price fall reflected scepticism the approach would succeed and investor concern about the dilutive impact of the cash-and-shares offer.  Under the terms of the offer, LSE shareholders would receive 2,045 pence in cash and 2.495 newly issued HKEX shares. HKEX said it intended to apply for a secondary listing of its shares on the LSE if the deal went through.  \u201cIf the market thought the deal was going to go ahead, I would have expected the shares to have fallen by more than 3%, typically that\u2019s what we\u2019d expect for an acquirer in a deal like this,\u201d said Michael Wu, analyst at Morningstar.","53":"(Adds PepsiCo) Jan 15 (Reuters) - A number of large U.S. companies, including AT&T Inc, American Express and Dow Inc, have said they would cut off campaign contributions to those who voted to challenge President-elect Joe Biden's victory, with Republicans in the U.S. Congress facing growing blowback from Corporate America.

LCH\u2019s dominance in London of clearing euro-denominated trades has become a political battleground as Britain prepares to leave the bloc next month, taking it outside EU financial law.  Paul Elkins, head of product development at RepoClear LCH, said its Paris clearing operation handled more than 700 billion euros ($793.24 billion) of euro-denominated repo and government debt transactions on Wednesday, leaving only a \u201cresidual\u201d amount at the London operation.  \u201cThe vast majority of repo trades are now being cleared by LCH in Paris,\u201d Elkins told Reuters.  A repo or repurchase agreement is a type of short-term loan for dealers in government debt. From next Monday, Paris will also be clearing all euro-denominated cash government bonds at LCH, Elkins said.  Corentine Poilvet-Clediere, head of RepoClear at LCH in Paris, said customers wanted to consolidate euro repo and bond clearing in one place to obtain efficiency savings.  But some policymakers and central bankers in the euro zone want the bulk of all types of euro trades transacted by EU customers to be cleared inside the bloc.  The shift in repos and bonds may not be enough to satisfy them as LCH in London clears nearly all euro denominated interest rate swaps (IRS), a popular contract used by companies to hedge against unexpected moves in borrowing costs.  Bank of France Governor Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau said last November he wants to see interest rate derivatives clearing in Paris, but so far LCH has said it will not make the investment due to lack of customer demand.  \u201cLCH has been very transparent from the beginning. From our conversations with customers, we thought that for repo there was a business and regulatory case for consolidation in Paris,\u201d Poilvet-Clediere said.  After \u201ccrunching the numbers\u201d, moving IRS clearing from London to Paris would not be the right solution for the market, a view backed by users, Poilvet-Clediere said.  Rival Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE is offering a profit-share to LCH customers who bring their business to its clearing arm in Frankfurt, but Poilvet-Clediere said that overall volumes at LCH have not changed.

The benchmark spot gold prices traded below U.S. gold futures in a sign the market is worried that air travel restrictions and refinery closures will hamper shipments of bullion to the United States to meet contractual requirements.  U.S. exchange operator CME Group on Tuesday announced a new gold futures contract to combat price volatility caused by the shutdown of gold supply routes, but traders and bankers said it would not immediately calm markets.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. and European Union flags are pictured during the visit of Vice President Mike Pence to the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium February 20, 2017. REUTERS\/Francois Lenoir\/File Photo  The EU has proposed giving its regulators stronger powers to supervise \u201csystemic\u201d or large foreign clearing houses handling transactions worth trillions of euros for investors in the bloc.  Washington fears the plans will see EU regulators working over the heads of American watchdogs to intervene in U.S. clearers like ICE ICE.N and CME CME.O. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) says the move threatens EU-U.S. clearing deals that took years negotiate.  \u201cI am not sure that having too many regulators has the right outcome,\u201d a senior U.S. clearing official told Reuters.  The draft law proposes \u201con site\u201d inspections of big foreign clearing houses handling transactions inside the bloc, instead of EU regulators going via the CFTC as they do now.  Patrick Pearson, a senior official at the European Commission, said current EU rules on foreign clearers rely too much on supervision by regulators in a clearer\u2019s market, but said Brussels did not want to revise or scrap bilateral deals.  \u201cWe have heard noise from the other side of the Atlantic,\u201d Pearson told a debate about the draft law in the European Parliament\u2019s economic affairs committee, adding that discussions about the EU plans would help \u201ccalm\u201d the situation.  The parliamentary committee met CFTC on Tuesday.  Committee Chair Roberto Gualtieri said the EU would endeavor to show it did not \u201cintend to regulate American farmers and agricultural derivatives\u201d which were not covered by the draft law.  CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo told the EU last year that changing bilateral deals would be a violation of trust.  Kay Swinburne, a British committee member, said CFTC had told the EU the bloc should trust home supervisors of foreign clearing houses and not legislate for \u201cdual oversight\u201d.  \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t think the location policy will ever be used, but we do need to think in terms of what it might be sending in terms of signals to the outside world,\u201d Swinburne.  Britain has also been critical of the EU plan, saying it was a bid to drive the clearing of euro-denominated assets away from London\u2019s financial center after Britain leaves the bloc in 2019.  The committee\u2019s debate on Wednesday showed broad backing for the draft law, subject to stricter criteria for deciding when euro clearing should move and clarity on the role of the European Central Bank in the decision.  EU lawmakers and member states have the final say on the draft law which Gualtieri wants approved by year end.","58":"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian farmers said they are seeking support to develop a soybean futures contract that would ease deals between Brazil, the world\u2019s largest soy exporter, and top importer China at a time of heightened U.S.-China trade tensions.  A worker inspects soybeans during the soy harvest near the town of Campos Lindos, Brazil February 18, 2018. REUTERS\/Ueslei Marcelino  A growing chorus of growers, analysts, bankers and even a U.S. Department of Agriculture economist said it would make sense to establish such a contract to hedge growing risks as Brazil and U.S. soybean prices diverge.  Brazilian soybean port premiums soared to a record spread of around $2 above Chicago prices following a decision by Beijing to slap a 25 percent tariff on U.S. soy in July in retaliation for duties imposed by President Donald Trump.  A new contract could provide an alternative to the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) that dominates the global market for soy pricing. CBOT\u2019s parent company, CME Group Inc, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Bartolomeu Braz, president of Brazilian grain growers association Aprosoja, said domestic soy farmers would like to see a new contract traded out of either Brazil or Argentina, the world\u2019s third-largest soybean producer.  He discussed the idea with the Argentine ambassador in Bras\u00edlia last year, and recently addressed the issue before a crowd of Chinese traders at a meeting of the FPA, the powerful agribusiness farm lobby of Brazil\u2019s Congress.  \u201cThe next steps involve seeking technical and legal advice to advance the process,\u201d he said in an interview last week.  Creating such a contract at Brazil\u2019s B3 SA exchange is not complicated and would only require definition of standards relative to price, quality and quantity, said Frederico Favacho, an agribusiness lawyer representing Brazilian grain processing and exporting groups.  If the trade war continues and China wants to secure new-crop South American soybeans in January and February, the premium placed on the Brazilian soy \u201cwould be up for negotiation and that premium would be difficult or impossible to hedge via the CBOT,\u201d said Dan Basse, an economist and president of Chicago-based consultancy AgResource.  The United States, the world\u2019s No. 2 soy exporter, last year sold about $12 billion worth of soybeans to the Chinese while Brazil\u2019s sales to that country were just above $20 billion, according to government data.  China has been virtually out of the U.S. market since tariffs were announced.  It makes \u201ceconomic sense\u201d to seek a different location to trade Brazilian soy, Warren Preston, deputy chief economist at the USDA, told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Sao Paulo.  With trade disruptions, currency fluctuations and transportation differentials adding to risk for producers and buyers, Preston said it has become \u201cmore difficult for people who use a CME contract to try to hedge their purchases and sales.\u201d  In July, S&P Global Platts started publishing three daily  domestic soybean price assessments named SOYBEX CFR China, SOYBEX FOB Santos and SOYBEX FOB Paranagua.  While Chinese diplomatic and industry sources say a South American soybean contract should be explored, they have stopped short of full-throated support.  Qu Yuhui, minister-councilor at the Chinese embassy in Brazil, said the concept of a Brazil-China direct futures contract merits discussion.  \u201cBoth sides should work in the direction of any idea - such as having the two sides signing futures contract - that allows Brazil\u2019s soy market and farmers to know how much Chinese demand there will be next year and lets Chinese buyers know what price they can get from Brazil,\u201d he said in an interview last month.  A top Chinese grain firm executive said the idea would be \u201cdisruptive,\u201d borrowing the Silicon Valley term for positive change.  \u201cInnovation is welcome as the market is undergoing structural changes and margins are tight,\u201d said the executive, who requested anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the media.","59":"FILE PHOTO: Men enter the CME Group offices in New York, U.S., October 18, 2017.

Currently up to 10,000 financial instruments, including shares, traded in the EU may qualify as third country, meaning their most liquid market is outside the bloc.  \u201cIf we considered shares that are currently available for trading not only on a UK trading venue but also in another EU jurisdiction, this represents around 1,900 potentially affected shares.\u201d  \u201cThese specific cases where EU trading venues might be subject to minimum tick sizes larger than those applicable on non-EU venues may have the unintended result of putting EU trading venues at a competitive disadvantage,\u201d ESMA Chair Steven Maijoor said in a statement.  \u201cThis might result in scarcer and shallower liquidity being available on EU trading venues which can be detrimental to those trading on those venues.

Euro clearing has become a political battleground since Britain voted in 2016 to leave the bloc next March.  LCH, part of the London Stock Exchange LSE.L, dominates clearing in euro-denominated instruments such as debt repurchase agreements and interest rate swaps from its base in Britain and increasingly from its French subsidiary.  France, however, believes that such a crucial role in bulk euro trades should not be handled by a clearing house outside the bloc, as LCH\u2019s London unit will be from next March when Britain leaves the European Union.  In what Britain sees as a grab for a core part of the City of London financial district, the EU proposed that \u201csystemic\u201d foreign clearing houses processing euro-denominated assets for EU customers must be open to EU supervision.  As a last resort, they should relocate to the bloc.  LCH Chief Executive Daniel Maguire said under a strategy began before Britain voted for Brexit, more euro clearing would move from London to its Paris LCH SA subsidiary.  \u201cIn 2018, we are aiming to offer clearing for as many euro-denominated debt repo products in Paris, as in London,\u201d Maguire told Reuters.  It now offers clearing in Paris in German and Belgian debt, in addition to the existing service for French, Spanish and Italian repo.  \u201cThis is about offering a choice to customers, rather than forcing a change. For example, some volume in Belgian debt has moved from London to Paris,\u201d Maguire said.  \u201cClearing in euro-denominated repos and debt is currently split equally between London and Paris but we anticipate gradual momentum of these products into LCH SA over time.\u201d  LCH cleared a record 175 trillion euros of repos across its London and Paris units in 2017, helped by expansion in the French capital.  Clearing involves passing stock, bond, derivative and repo trades through a third party backed by a default fund to ensure completion of the transaction even if one side of the deal goes bust.  DISTINCTIONS  France also wants a significant amount of the $873 trillion euro-denominated interest rate swaps (IRS) clearing done out of London last year to move to the single currency area.  But Maguire said policymakers and central bankers such as ECB President Mario Draghi were coming round to see a distinction between products.  Euro bonds and repos play a regional role in directly \u201ctransmitting\u201d central bank monetary policy, while interest rate swaps are a global market and do not, Maguire said.  \u201cIf you make that distinction, then perhaps you can have different approaches to oversight and supervision,\u201d Maguire said.  LCH has no plans to voluntarily split its multi-currency IRS pool by enabling IRS clearing in Paris.  Rival Eurex, owned by Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE is stepping up attempts to attract euro IRS clearing and Maguire said he would continue to monitor such competition.  He sought to reassure EU policymakers that LCH would comply with the bloc\u2019s derivatives rules after Brexit.  \u201cOur goal is to continue to provide the markets with a range of services, at our very high standards,\u201d Maguire said.  Since the financial crisis, clearers must show they could collapse without causing a market meltdown, but Maguire said this requirement does not fully reflect steps taken by users of clearers, such as banks to make themselves safer.  Such regulatory overlaps should be simplified to help focus clearers on fire prevention rather than fire fighting, he said.  \u201cYes, we should have the right degree of enhanced supervision and regulatory oversight, but it needs to be proportionate and service and product specific in order to be both appropriate and effective \u2013 in all scenarios,\u201d Maguire said.","63":"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)  * LME Steel Contracts: tmsnrt.rs\/2D7mQ48  LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - It\u2019s been almost a decade since the iron ore market abandoned the annual benchmark system of pricing.  The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) caused such dislocation between annual and spot prices that even sceptics such as Brazil\u2019s Vale joined the revolution.  Ten years on and the iron ore market is a changed landscape, producers now selling most of their product basis spot, monthly or quarterly prices.  This collective shift towards spot pricing has driven an explosion in iron ore futures trading.  The Singapore Exchange (SGX), which was the first to launch iron ore products in the form of swaps, registered turnover of 17.6 million tonnes in 2010, the first full year of trading.  Last year activity on its core iron ore futures contract exceeded 1.28 billion tonnes and that on its options contract 295 million tonnes.  SGX\u2019s steel swaps and futures, by contrast, haven\u2019t traded at all since the end of 2016 and 2014 respectively.  The revolution in iron ore pricing has largely failed to travel down the steel value chain, producers reluctant to lose their pricing power and fearful that futures trading will open the door to speculative price drivers.  The London Metal Exchange (LME) is betting three new contracts will help change the collective hostility.  Graphic on LME steel contracts\u2019 performance:  tmsnrt.rs\/2D7mQ48  SCRAP SUCCESS  The new index contracts, all for hot rolled coil (HRC), one for each major geographic region, will be launched early next year.  LME officials seem quietly confident that at least one of the new HRC contracts will find traction.  Expectations have been buoyed by the success of the LME\u2019s steel scrap contract, launched in 2015.  Volumes grew from 49,000 contracts in 2016 to 308,000 contracts last year and were up by another 74 percent in the first nine months of this year.  More significantly, open interest hit a fresh high of 13,129 lots at the end of September with positions open up to 15 months forward.  \u201cThe presence of open interest on further dated prompts often suggests that the financial derivatives have been used to hedge physical exposure to the underlying commodity,\u201d according to the LME\u2019s \u201cFerrous Monthly Update\u201d.  The LME\u2019s steel rebar contract has less open interest, just 805 lots at the end of September, but what it does have is also distributed down the futures curve.  Rebar volumes have failed to match those of scrap, suggesting that steel producers are much more willing to use futures markets to hedge inputs such as scrap and iron ore than their outputs such as rebar.  Or hot rolled coil.  Which is why the LME\u2019s new contracts are an interesting gambit.  CHINESE GIANT  The LME is not the first exchange to promote steel product futures.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) launched its rebar contract in 2009 and its HRC contract in 2014.  Both are highly liquid with construction-use rebar popularly traded as a proxy for China\u2019s property sector.  Speculators rule in Shanghai.  And most of them do not hold positions for very long. The ratio of open interest to volume on the Shanghai rebar contract was under five percent at the end of October. That on the LME\u2019s rebar contract is usually well in excess of 20 percent.  If there is industrial hedging activity taking place in Shanghai, it\u2019s hard to discern beneath the ebb and flow of investment money.  Shanghai, moreover, is a domestic Chinese market with little direct pricing impact on steel supply chains in the rest of the world.  US RESURGENCE?  In the United States CME unveiled an HRC contract in 2010 and a steel scrap contract in 2012.  The latter looked in danger of extinction in early 2016 with several months of zero volumes and open interest.  However, this year has seen a transformation with activity surging to 17,087 contracts in January-October from just 1,220 contracts in the same period last year.  Open interest has jumped from 680 contracts to 3,988 over the same time frame.  Given this lift in activity has coincided with the fast growth in the LME\u2019s scrap contract, the inference is that an arbitrage trade between the U.S. Midwest (CME) and the Black Sea (LME) scrap markets is evolving.  The turnaround in the CME\u2019s HRC contract has been less pronounced but after nearly a year of falling activity, trading volumes started growing again around the middle of last year.  In the first 10 months of this year over 2 million tonnes traded, a year-on-year jump of 89 percent.  The mechanics of which contract on which exchange is driving the collective pick-up in trading activity are unclear but it\u2019s a sign that something is starting to stir in the steel pricing world.  NO REVOLUTION  But don\u2019t expect steel producers to stampede into this fledgling futures arena.  This will be no revolution as happened to iron ore, more a gradual creep.  For a start, there are many more steel producers than big iron ore suppliers.  Back in 2009-2010 it took just three iron ore players, Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, to switch pricing and the entire industry switched with them.  Secondly, the break from annual producer-to-consumer prices was accelerated by a totally unexpected event in the form of the GFC and the resulting collapse in iron ore demand.  Faced with yearly contracts locked into higher prices, many iron ore buyers simply walked away.  The GFC shock cruelly exposed the failings of the annual benchmark contract system, triggering a mass move to spot or close-to-spot trading.  Without such a dramatic external driver, steel pricing is more likely to evolve than explode. Producers will continue to resist. Big consumers such as the automotive companies will continue to push for change.  But the apparent liquidity creep from the LME to the CME suggests that some in the steel supply chain are starting to embrace futures pricing.  The LME is betting that more will follow.","64":"(Updates with afternoon trading)  * Oil prices rise ahead of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview  * Wall Street indexes higher on strong economic data  * Dollar falls against yen, gains against other currencies  By Nick Brown  NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices rallied on Friday afternoon ahead of a much-anticipated television interview with Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, while Wall Street rose on strong economic data as U.S. stocks tried to end a rocky week on a high note.  Crude prices had been on track for a weekly loss, but spiked on Friday, putting oil in position for a gain on the week.  Energy investors were looking to cover short bets ahead of a televised interview Sunday by the U.S. news program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.  The prince will be \u201ccomparing Iran\u2019s Ayatollah to Hitler, and the battle in Ghouta, Syria, is ramping up,\u201d said John Kilduff, partner at investment manager Again Capital in New York. \u201cYou can\u2019t be short oil over the weekend with all that going on in the region.\u201d  U.S. crude rose 1.78 percent to $62.28 per barrel and Brent was last at $66.15, up 1.58 percent on the day. Brent crude prices hit their highest in more than two weeks as U.S. stock prices rose and investors looked to cover short bets.  The S&P 500, which was down 1.5 percent on the week through Thursday, was trying to avoid its first five-day losing streak of 2018. Shares have struggled to weather a growing sense of turmoil in U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and signs that protectionist policies could spur a trade war.  But those fears took a back seat, at least temporarily, to economic data showing U.S. factory output jumped 1.1 percent in February.  Retailer Walmart was up around 2.75 percent, and Home Depot had gained nearly 1 percent, after the University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary reading of consumer sentiment index rose more than expected to 102.0.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 114.48 points, or 0.46 percent, to 24,988.14, the S&P 500 gained 7.1 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,754.43 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.61 points, or 0.02 percent, to 7,483.35.  European shares lost ground for the week, despite a modest gain on Friday, driven by exchange operator NEX Group\u2019s 30-percent jump after a takeover offer from U.S.-based peer CME Group.  The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.29 percent, and MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.04 percent. Trade volume in U.S. government bonds was low and, save for a modest steepening, yields were little moved, as the market quieted in anticipation of next week\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.  The U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates at that meeting for the first time this year. \u201cWe\u2019re looking towards next Wednesday,\u201d said Justin Lederer, Treasury analyst and trader at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.  Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 7\/32 in price to yield 2.85 percent, from 2.824 percent late on Thursday.  The 30-year bond last fell 14\/32 in price to yield 3.0835 percent, from 3.061 percent Thursday.  The solid economic data, which bolstered the consensus expectation of a rate hike, also pushed the dollar up slightly against a basket of six currencies, with the dollar index rising 0.11 percent. The euro was down 0.18 percent to $1.2282.  But fears of political tensions did not disappear entirely, boosting the safe-haven Japanese yen, which strengthened 0.23 percent versus the greenback at 106.13 per dollar.  The dollar had earlier fallen as low as 105.61 against the yen, the lowest since March 7.  Sterling was last trading at $1.3939, up 0.02 percent on the day.  Euro zone bond yields kept falling after another European Central Bank policymaker warned that inflation in the bloc remained sluggish, a potential hurdle to the withdrawal of monetary stimulus.","65":"LONDON (Reuters) - The growing use of computer-run algorithms to trade currencies is helping foreign exchange markets function but could undermine the quality of forex prices reported publicly if they become too common, the Bank of International Settlements said on Friday.  FILE PHOTO: Saudi riyal, yuan, Turkish lira, pound, U.S. dollar, euro and Jordanian dinar banknotes are seen in this illustration taken January 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Execution algorithms, or \u201calgos\u201d as they are popularly known, are used for an estimated 10%-20% of daily global spot trading.  Regulatory demands to minimise costs and improve transparency have spurred the growth of algos in the $6.6 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, where trading is fragmented across dozens of different platforms.  The low market volatility seen since the 2008 global financial crisis has also increased take-up, with many participants turning to them as a more efficient way to trade than traditional voice-brokered or electronic methods.  That efficiency was evident during the COVID-19-induced market selloff in March, when currency market volatility exploded after years of calm. Providers reported more than a doubling of algo-related volumes relative to average usage, the BIS said.  \u201cThe impact on market functioning will depend on many factors, including the direction in which EAs (execution algorithms) evolve, their market share, how well their risks are understood and managed, and how they interact with other developments in financial markets,\u201d the BIS, an umbrella group for central bankers, said in a report.  FX execution algorithms are automated trading programs designed to buy or sell a predefined amount according to a set of instructions.  They have evolved from simple mechanical rule-based trading to more complex strategies that assess market conditions in real time. Users can bundle order book data across multiple venues and slice large orders into smaller chunks.  Increasing algo usage has also facilitated a growing trend towards internalisation, whereby a market maker -- usually a bank -- will try to offset currency trades internally without passing them to external venues, a process known as \u201cdark\u201d trading.  But the BIS warned that while market participants have been able to benefit from banks matching trades internally, at the extreme too many internalised trades could reduce turnover on primary venues and undermine the quality of the prices they report.  This matters because prices from primary trading venues such as Refinitiv and EBS are used as reference prices for other currency trading platforms and for bilateral trading.  Rising algo usage has also been accompanied by more so-called \u201cflash crashes\u201d, in which prices move sharply for unexplained reasons, that have drawn the attention of global regulators.

Spot gold was up 0.1% at $1,690.08 per ounce by 0916 GMT, having risen to its highest since March 9 on Friday. Most European markets are closed for the Easter Monday holiday. U.S. gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,741.40. \"Gold has been on the positive side from the last two to three weeks; mostly it's safe-haven buying and the main reason is that the global economy is likely to face a recession because of the COVID-19 issue,\" Hareesh V, head of commodity research at Geojit Financial Services, said. More than 1.8 million people have been infected by the coronavirus globally and 113,849 have died, a Reuters calculation of the totals shows. The coronavirus pandemic, which has battered global economic growth, has forced nations to extend lockdowns to curtail its spread, and central banks have announced a wave of fiscal and monetary support measures to mitigate the financial toll. The U.S. Federal Reserve on Thursday announced a broad, $2.3 trillion stimulus package to weather the outbreak, which has forced 16.8 million Americans to file for unemployment benefits since the week ended March 21. \"COVID-19's deflationary effect has been a headwind for gold. But this trend should reverse in 2H20 as policy responses by governments and central banks gather traction, UBS analysts said in a note. \"Led by Fed easing, we now expect real U.S. interest rates to dip deeper into negative territory and perhaps even test the post-GFC (global financial crisis) lows,\" UBS said. Gold is highly sensitive to interest rates, as lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. Reflecting appetite for bullion, holdings in SPDR Gold Trust GLD, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 0.6% to 994.19 tonnes on Thursday. European Union finance ministers also agreed on half-a-trillion euros worth of economic support, but left open the question of how to finance recovery in the bloc. Among other precious metals, palladium rose 2.9% to $2,233.96 per ounce, while platinum dipped 0.7% to $743.06 and silver fell 0.3% to $15.27.

But after nearly four decades of trading, sometimes winning, sometimes losing, Anthony Ward threw in the towel.  FILE PHOTO: A man enters the CME Group offices in New York, United States, October 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Ward blames the rise of computer-driven funds and high-frequency trading for forcing him and some other well-known commodities investors to close their hedge funds and look for opportunities where machines can\u2019t make a difference.  While computerised trading is not new, Ward and others argue its steady rise has reached a tipping point that is distorting prices and creating uncertainty not only for investors, but for chocolate firms, carmakers and others who rely on commodities.  It was in January 2016, after a slide in cocoa prices, that Ward decided the days of traditional commodity investors doing well from taking positions based on fundamentals such as supply and demand may be numbered.  \u201cIt was just too big, too quick, too dramatic. And completely against the fundamentals,\u201d Ward told Reuters.  Commodity markets fell across the board that month after weak factory data in China raised fears of lower demand from the world\u2019s top consumer of raw materials.  Ward blamed the slide in cocoa on what he regarded as misplaced selling by computer-driven funds reacting to the Chinese data, given China has scant impact on the cocoa market.  \u201cThe actual fundamentals in cocoa were extraordinarily bullish in January 2016. We were forecasting the largest harmattan in history, which is exactly what happened,\u201d he said.  His prediction that a hot, harmattan wind from the Sahara desert would hit harvests in Ivory Coast and Ghana and drive cocoa prices higher did come to pass - but not before the fund had been forced to cut its losses when the market slumped.  At the end of 2017, Ward closed the CC+ hedge fund that had invested in cocoa and coffee markets for years.  And at the end of January, commodity hedge fund Jamison Capital Partners run by Stephen Jamison closed. He told investors that machine learning and artificial intelligence had eliminated short-term trading opportunities, while commodities did not offer obvious benefits in the long term.  Also in 2017, renowned oil trader Andrew Hall, who earned $100 million in 2008, called time on his main Astenbeck Commodities Fund II.  He had said in an earlier letter to investors that extreme volatility caused by \u201cnon-traditional investors and algorithmic trading\u201d made it difficult to hold onto long-term positions when the market moved against them.  In 2016, Michael Farmer, founding partner of the Red Kite fund that specialises in copper, also accused high-frequency traders using super-fast computers of distorting the market and getting an unfair advantage.  GRAPHIC- Rise of automated trading: reut.rs\/2BiHAF8  DISTORTION?  Other investors have taken refuge in related sectors or left commodities altogether, exasperated by the automated trading that drives about half of U.S. commodity futures trading.  A study by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission last year showed computerised trading on the world\u2019s largest futures exchange, CME Group, accounted for 49 percent of the volume in agriculture contracts and 58 percent for some energy contracts.  At the same time, data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research shows the average hedge fund returned 8.64 percent in 2017 but commodity hedge funds eked out returns of just 0.43 percent.  Ward estimates that while in the past automated trading would distort the market by 10 percent to 15 percent from prices justified by fundamentals - which he said was irritating but often manageable - it can now reach 25 percent to 30 percent.  Algorithmic, or systematic, funds use computers to make decisions after processing vast amounts of data, or trade on signals such as market momentum or when prices hit key levels.  Those who run automated funds argue that they inject much-needed liquidity while capturing the dynamics of the market more efficiently than traditional trading strategies.  Farmer and others say, however, that it is unfair for exchanges to allow high-frequency trading (HFT) groups to have co-location platforms, allowing them to put super-computers in the same data centre as the exchange servers.  They say that gives HFTs the tiny advantage they need to jump ahead of incoming orders, effectively piggybacking. Traditional investors say this exacerbates market moves and in turn makes it more costly for them to take out hedges when price moves go against them.  MIND-BOGGLING DATA  Systematic fund managers see the rise of their sector as a part of a trend that is transforming not only financial markets but wider society with the advent of artificial intelligence, robots and machine learning.  \u201cI don\u2019t feel too sorry (for traditional fund managers),\u201d said Anthony Lawler, co-head of GAM Systematic, the quantitative part of Swiss money manager GAM Holding, which had assets under management (AUM) of 148.4 billion Swiss francs (114.12 billion pounds) at the end of September.  \u201cInformation, which used to be expensive, difficult to get, not easily shared, is now ubiquitous. It\u2019s truly mind-boggling the depth of data available,\u201d Lawler said.  \u201cThat means it\u2019s much more difficult to have an information edge and advantage to the player who can digest and analyse the data the quickest.\u201d  GAM Systematic, which had $4.3 billion of assets at the end of September, regards commodities as one of many markets it monitors for opportunities by crunching data such as weather forecasts and shipping data that shows how full a vessel is.  He acknowledged that algorithms can lead to mistakes and over-generalisation, but said that should just open up opportunities for traditional fund managers.  \u201cIf you\u2019re a great discretionary trader, then sit on the sidelines and wait for those missteps ... I would be super happy if that trader is successfully picking off some of these missteps,\u201d said Lawler.  Systematic funds also make decisions based on the structure and technical levels of markets. Some analysts argue that markets absorb fundamental information before many analysts are aware of it and automated funds are simply more efficient.  \u201cI used to do a lot of fundamental analysis when I was in equities and I realised it doesn\u2019t really matter, it was a waste of time,\u201d said Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at commodities broker Marex Spectron.  \u201cThe truth is fundamental analysis is effectively the work of a historian, seeking to provide explanation for what has already occurred,\u201d he said.  SCHIZOPHRENIC MARKETS  Some fund managers and analysts say computerised trading has been amplified in commodities because other participants such as banks and pension funds have cut exposure to the sector.  Total global commodity assets under management more than halved from 2012 to 2015 to under $200 billion, though the total has since recovered to just over $300 billion, according to Barclays.  \u201cThere\u2019s less liquidity, and therefore prices are more choppy, more schizophrenic, because of the exit of so many market counterparties,\u201d said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at French bank Societe Generale.  Not all those who have closed commodity hedge funds put the blame on computers.  \u201cEither you read the information badly, or you have bad information,\u201d said Christophe Cordonnier, who co-founded the Belaco Capital fund in 2012 after heading investor sales in commodities at Societe Generale.  Cordonnier says Belaco Capital made a bad decision on timing, launching the fund in 2012 and counting on a global economic recovery to boost commodities. After a rebound failed to materialise, the fund closed in 2015.  Other fund managers have survived by being creative, such as Christoph Eibl, chief executive of Tiberius Asset Management, whose commodity assets under management have dwindled from $2.5 billion at its peak to about $350 million.  \u201cSeven years ago we started diversifying our business operations,\u201d said Eibl. He now operates a merchant business in metals with a turnover of more than $1 billion a year, runs tungsten and tin mines in Africa and Asia and is soon to launch a metals-backed crypto-currency.  Ever the risk taker, Ward still plans to trade cocoa and coffee - but only with his own money - while looking for opportunities in the underlying physical commodities markets. And he\u2019s keeping a close eye on computerised trading.  \u201cIn the end the whole thing will blow up because when there\u2019s a big problem, a black swan event, they won\u2019t be able to get out. It will be very messy,\u201d said Ward.","68":"May 22 (Reuters) - Financial technology company NEX Group , which is being bought by U.S. exchange operator CME Group, reported a 9 percent rise in full-year core trading profit, helped by market volatility and growth in emerging markets.

The coronavirus pandemic has destroyed around a third of global fuel demand since early March and left producers worldwide struggling to store the resulting massive glut of oil.  U.S. crude plunged $55.90, or 306%, to settle for the first time ever below zero. The contract settled at a discount of $37.63 a barrel after touching an all-time low of -$40.32 a barrel.  U.S. crude reflected global oversupply, high levels in U.S. storage, and convergence of futures and cash prices ahead of the May West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil contract\u2019s expiration on Tuesday, CME Group said.  \u201cCME Group markets continue to function effectively as participants use our WTI futures contracts to transfer their risk during these uncertain times,\u201d the company said.  CME shares fell 3.7%, outpacing a decline in the broader market.  When oil futures contracts expire, the holder has to take possession of 1,000 barrels of oil for every contract owned, delivered to the main U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma. However, Cushing is filling up, leaving traders with the unappetizing option of taking oil they do not want, or getting out of those positions.  \u201cIn this kind of world, nobody wants to have too much raw material around,\u201d said Dan Basse, president of consultancy AgResource Co.  That threat of having to take physical delivery is why the May contract plunged on Monday, said Jeff Carter, a venture capitalist and former Chicago Mercantile Exchange board member.  CME updated its systems to process negative prices earlier this month. In a notice dated April 8, it told clearing firms and clients that it had a plan in place \u201cif major energy prices continue to fall toward zero in the coming months,\u201d and if WTI crude oil, RBOB gasoline or heating oil futures fell between or below a certain range.

Clearing of its euro repo trades at London Stock Exchange\u2019s LCH unit in London had already moved to LCH\u2019s Paris arm in order to be inside the EU after Brexit.  Migration of trading and clearing is a blow to London as a global financial center, with more business to follow the Chicago-headquartered exchange.  While Brexit is due to take place on March 29, it now looks increasingly likely that it will be delayed.  Cboe Europe, the largest pan-European share trading platform, plans to move euro-denominated share trading from London to a new unit in Amsterdam, with trading starting on April 1.  But Cboe Europe said last week it was \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d political discussions and would react as quickly as possible to any developments that would alter this launch date.  Britain\u2019s government is scrambling to get support in parliament for a Brexit deal ahead of an EU summit on Thursday.  Separately on Monday, EuroCCP, a clearing house for stock trades, said it had obtained regulatory approval to clear trades for the new EU entities of Cboe Europe, Aquis Exchange, and London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise from April 1.  EuroCCP said it had also \u201con-boarded\u201d six new EU-based entities acting as clearing members, and more than 10 new EU-based trading members.  EuroCCP, which clears over 30 percent of European share trades, is incorporated in the Netherlands and owned by Dutch Bank ABN Amro, Cboe Europe, Euronext, Nasdaq, and the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corp (DTCC).  The announcement means that a large chunk of clearing in euro-denominated share trades, currently handled by EuroCCP and rivals like LCH in London, is also set to move to Amsterdam.  Clearing refers to a third party that ensures completion of a trade even if one side goes bust.  EuroCCP said it would activate the new clearing arrangements in EU-listed securities as soon as the new EU-based venues are ready  \u201cWhile the uncertainty continues and despite the increasing likelihood that there may be a delay to Brexit, we are still focused on our preparations in case the UK leaves the EU on 29 March,\u201d said EuroCCP Chief Executive C\u00e9cile Nagel.

FILE PHOTO: An exterior view of the Nanyou branch of the Bank of China in Shenzhen, China November 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Staff  The bank is facing investor fury over heavy losses on an oil-related investment product after an unprecedented crash in energy markets.  BoC said in a statement late on Wednesday that it would continue negotiating with investors, would shoulder responsibilities under the current legal framework and was seeking to respond to customers\u2019 \u201creasonable requests\u201d as early as possible.  Prices for the May West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil contract fell below zero for the first time on April 20, ending at minus $37.63 a barrel.  Oil prices have tumbled this year due to a slump in global demand caused by the coronavirus, a price war triggered by Saudi Arabia and Russia, and a shortage of storage for excess oil, leading to steep falls in many oil-linked products.  CME, which owns the New York Mercantile Exchange where WTI futures trade, had updated its systems in early April to be able to process negative prices.  BoC said last week it would settle trades for its retail investor crude oil product, also known as crude oil \u201cbao\u201d, at negative prices, causing investor outrage as they felt BoC should have done more to protect their interests.  The crude oil \u201cbao\u201d, which is linked to foreign crude oil futures contracts including WTI, allows investors to roll over their positions into coming months themselves. BoC, however, automatically settles them on the final trading day of an expiring contract if investors leave it to the bank. The collapse in WTI futures occurred on the May contract\u2019s last trading day.  Retail investors may have lost more than 9 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) from BoC\u2019s crude oil product, financial news outlet Caixin reported on Sunday, citing unnamed sources.  CME told Reuters in an emailed statement on Thursday that its markets worked as designed.  \u201cOur futures prices reflect fundamentals in the physical crude oil market driven by the unprecedented global impacts of the coronavirus, including decreased demand for crude, global oversupply, and high levels of U.S. storage utilization,\u201d it said.  \u201cAfter advance notice to our regulator and the marketplace in early April, CME Group accommodated negative futures prices on WTI on April 20 so that clients could manage their risk amid dramatic price moves, while also ensuring the convergence of futures and cash prices.\u201d  The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said it had asked BoC to investigate the problem of its crude oil products.  Banks were urged to tighten risk management regarding products linked to futures, the regulator said in response to Reuters questions.  CBIRC has asked commercial banks to halt new sales of a wide range of wealth management products that might lead to unlimited losses for investors, two sources told Reuters.  Industrial and Commercial Bank Of China (ICBC) and China Construction Bank (CCB) also offer similar crude oil-linked products, but had rolled over their investors\u2019 positions days ahead of contract expiration, local media reported.  Bank of Communications Co Ltd (BoCom) said the fall in WTI crude oil futures prices to negative territory had no impact on customers of its oil futures trading products, as it had rolled over or closed its positions on April 14, according to local media The Paper.","73":"* U.S. 2-year, 10-year note yields drop to 7-week lows * U.S. 30-year bond yields fall to four-month low * Italian debt volume surges this month -Tradeweb (Updates prices in text, table, recasts lead, adds Treasury volume) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, May 29 (Reuters) - U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields posted their largest one-day drop on Tuesday since Britain voted to exit the European Union nearly two years ago, as a political crisis in Italy, the third-largest euro zone economy, fueled a flight to safe-haven assets. The steep rally in Treasury prices on Tuesday could be a blip in what has been a relentless sell-off since early September. Interest rates have been supported by the Federal Reserve's tightening policy with 10-year Treasury yields rising to a high of 3.12 percent earlier this month. U.S. two-year yields, which move inversely to prices, also showed steep declines, with their largest one-day drop in more than nine years. Both the U.S. two-year and 10-year yields dropped to seven-week lows and slid for four straight sessions. U.S. 30-year bond yields, on the other hand, sank to a nearly four-month low. The fall in yields came after Italy's president appointed a former International Monetary Fund official as interim prime minister, who has to plan for fresh elections and pass a budget. Investors believe the election will further underpin a mandate for anti-establishment, euro-skeptic politicians, stoking worries about Italy's future in the euro zone. The extent of the rally in U.S. Treasuries reflects investors' perception of Italy's political problems, said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income in Newark, New Jersey. \"This situation with Italy is serious and will take some time and there are a wide range of possible outcomes. Treasuries are one of the few safe places to go to,\" Tipp said. \"It depends on how bad things get in Italy. You can't rule out 2.50 percent on the (U.S.) 10-year yield.\" Analysts believed though that the Italian situation is contained for now. The spreads of other peripheral government bond yields over German Bunds have increased, but not by a substantial level. \"This suggests that investors are for now fairly confident that the euro-zone as a whole will be able to withstand the current political uncertainty in Italy,\" said Stephen Brown, European economist at Capital Economics in London. In afternoon trading, U.S. 10-year yields dropped to seven-week lows of 2.759 percent and were last at 2.788 percent. Yields fell 14.6 basis points, the largest decline since June 24, 2016. U.S. 10-year Treasury futures were on track to record their highest single-day volume ever, according to a CME Group spokeswoman said. As of late Tuesday, a combined 8.58 million 10-year T-note futures changed hands with roughly 5.31 million contracts for June delivery transacted TYM8, according to CME data. U.S. 30-year yields fell to 2.954 percent, the lowest level since Feb. 1 and last traded at 2.975 percent. Thirty-year yields slid nearly 12 basis points, the largest daily fall since June 2016. On the short-end of the curve, U.S. 2-year yields tumbled to seven-week troughs of 2.311 percent. They last changed hands at 2.331 percent, falling nearly 15 basis points, the most since March 2009. A rush to safe havens briefly pushed Germany's 10-year bond yield to 0.19 percent, its lowest in more than a year. Investors, however, sold Italian bonds, as short-term yields were on track for their biggest one-day jump since 1992 . Tradeweb Markets LLC reported on Tuesday that average trading volume in Italian debt rose more than 60 percent in May compared with both the previous month and a year earlier, as market volatility rose around political news in Italy.

Anti-Brexit demonstrators waving EU and Union flags are reflected in a puddle in front of the Houses of Parliament in London. REUTERS\/Toby Melville  Britain\u2019s M&A market has remained buoyant despite the country\u2019s looming exit from the European Union a year from now, a prospect which has cast uncertainty over British companies\u2019 access to the single market.  Rather than deter businesses from striking deals, however, it has prompted them to prepare for Brexit by acquiring rivals to build scale.  The availability of cheap debt, high equity valuations that are allowing companies to use their stock to pay for acquisitions, and economic growth are all behind the surge in M&A, bankers said.  The value of M&A volumes involving British businesses rose by 56.5 percent to $164.3 billion during the first quarter, the most since the $166.3 billion recorded in the same period 11 years ago, Thomson Reuters data show.  Including plans by Anglo-Dutch Unilever and RELX to abandon their dual listing structures, total deal levels hit $280.8 billion in the first three months of 2018 in the UK, according to the data.  It means that Britain remained the second biggest country for deals behind the United States. Globally, dealmaking surged 67 percent to almost $1.2 trillion, the data show.  In Britain this week alone, U.S. exchange operator CME Group CME.O agreed to buy British financial technology firm NEX NXGN.L for about 3.9 billion pounds ($5.5 billion) and Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical 4502.T said it was considering an approach for FTSE 100 drugmaker Shire SHP.L, which has a market value of about 32 billion pounds.  \u201cThis feels like it\u2019s going to be a big year for M&A,\u201d said Alison Harding-Jones, the head of European, Middle East and Africa M&A at Citigroup. \u201cThis is not just UK based and is driven by a perfect storm of all the ingredients you need for deals.\u201d  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cBREXIT SQUEEZE\u201d  British companies are bulking up in preparation for the post-Brexit era.  Dwayne Lysaght, the head of UK M&A at JP Morgan Cazenove, said there is \u201ca bit of a Brexit squeeze which is encouraging a focus on domestic consolidation.\u201d  \u201cBritish companies are acknowledging the need to be bigger to compete in a more open, global market place,\u201d he added.  Domestic deals totaled $43.3 billion in value during the first quarter, up from $24.9 billion a year earlier, the Thomson Reuters data show.  They include events and exhibitions business Informa's INF.L 3.9 billion-pound deal to acquire rival UBM UBM.L and the sale of Standard Life Aberdeen's SLA.L insurance business to Phoenix PHNX.L for 3.2 billion pounds.  The biggest is Melrose Industries MRON.L 8 billion-pound takeover of aerospace and automotive parts supplier GKN GKN.L, which was Britain's largest hostile bid since Kraft swooped on Cadbury in 2009. Melrose clinched the deal on Thursday after 52.4 percent of GKN investors accepted its cash-and-shares offer.  Stripping out Unilever and RELX, outbound M&A volumes were$27.2 billion, down from $42.3 billion in 2017, while inbound deals rose to $77.9 billion pounds, from $17.5 billion a year earlier, according to the data.  TOP OF THE MARKET?  The biggest bid by an overseas acquirer for a British group was Comcast's CMCSA.O potential 22.1 billion-pound proposal for Sky SKYB.L, an attempt by the U.S. giant to gatecrash the takeover the broadcaster agreed with its 39 percent shareholder Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O late in 2016.  Both Fox\u2019s pending bid for Sky and Melrose\u2019s acquisition of GKN have drawn considerable scrutiny from British lawmakers.  The former has raised concerns about Rupert Murdoch\u2019s influence over the UK media landscape, while the latter has sparked fears Melrose will break up GKN, a mainstay of Britain\u2019s engineering sector, once it has turned the company around.  Indeed, under Theresa May, who became prime minister in July 2016, the British government has adopted a more interventionist stance toward M&A by foreign companies.  In October, it proposed new rules that would give lawmakers more say over takeovers of firms involved in the more sensitive technology and defense sectors.  Even so, that stance has not deterred overseas businesses from attempting to buy British firms, said Dominic Morris, the head of UK M&A at law firm Allen & Overy.  \u201cYes, you could argue the government\u2019s being more activist to some degree and people have to be mindful of that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut do I think it\u2019s right up there at the top of (acquirer\u2019s) agenda? I\u2019m not sure it is.\u201d  More worrying for the M&A bankers and lawyers would be if the current boom in deals proved to be the top of the cycle, as it was 11 years ago, and activity begins to falter.  \u201cIt feels very similar to 2007,\u201d said Morris. \u201cI would say if we\u2019re not at the top of the market, we must be pretty close to it.\u201d","76":"March 19 (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 is seen opening 9 points lower at 7,290 on Tuesday, according to financial bookmakers. * SAINSBURY: Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda will provide a more specific commitment to cut prices in response to a negative provisional view by Britain's competition watchdog of their proposed tie-up, the Financial Times reported on Monday. * EASYJET: British budget airline easyJet pulled out of talks to rescue Alitalia on Monday, leaving the Italian carrier's future uncertain only two weeks before a deadline to save it. * OCADO: British online supermarket Ocado plans to establish an office for its Ocado Solutions technology business in the Washington D.C. area of the United States, it said on Monday. * CME GROUP: Euro-denominated government bond, repurchase agreement and foreign exchange trading at CME Group has moved from London to Amsterdam to avoid disruption from Brexit, the exchange said on Monday. * GOLD: Gold prices rose for a third consecutive session on Tuesday as the dollar weakened on expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain a dovish tone at its monetary policy meeting this week. * OIL: Oil prices were near 2019 highs on Tuesday, supported by supply cuts led by producer club OPEC. * The UK blue-chip index closed 0.98 percent higher at 7299.19 on Monday after Britain's parliament speaker struck a fresh blow to Theresa May's EU divorce deal, while a rally in miners and oil stocks also lent support. * For more on the factors affecting European stocks, please click on: * UK CORPORATE DIARY: TP ICAP Full year result Antofagasta Full year result John Wood Group Full year result SCS group Half year result Mears group Full year result Softcat Half year result Judges Scientific Full year result ASOS Plc Trading Statement Ocado Group Trading Statement TODAY'S UK PAPERS > Financial Times > Other business headlines Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra : visit topnews.session.rservices.com * For Top News : topnews.reuters.com (Reporting by Adil Bhat in Bengaluru)","77":"(Repeats story issued earlier, with no change to text)  * Shanghai Futures Exchange to launch copper options on Friday  * China\u2019s first industrial options after soymeal, sugar  * Country is world\u2019s biggest copper consumer  BEIJING, Sept 20 (Reuters) - The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) will launch copper options trading on Friday, aiming to take a slice of a $270 billion global market in one of its biggest challenges yet to London and New York rivals.  The product, which follows the launch of sugar and soymeal options last year, comes as the exchange also considers opening its flagship copper futures to foreign investors, and is a major step in China\u2019s prolonged effort to develop its derivatives industry.  Options help metal consumers, producers and traders manage price exposure. A contract gives the buyer the right - but no obligation - to assume a futures position at a specified price.  Over the past decade, the Shanghai bourse which was set up in 1999 has carved out a bigger share of the global copper futures market, challenging the London Metal Exchange\u2019s (LME) near dominance as China\u2019s economy boomed and retail investors flocked to commodities futures trading.  Now it wants a part of the burgeoning options business.  Volumes of copper options traded on the LME totaled around $265 billion last year at current prices, up 0.3 percent on a year earlier, while Comex copper options traded on CME Group almost tripled to 104,490 lots in 2017, worth about $7.3 billion.  Some Chinese copper firms already trade options on the established London and New York markets, but others are not able to stump up the foreign currency required as collateral for trading. The ShFE copper contract is denominated in yuan.  \u201cAt the moment, ShFE copper options can be best seen as alternative to onshore market participants with restricted or no access to LME copper options,\u201d said Rochelle Wei, CEO of J.P. Morgan Futures Co.  Hedging in China rather than overseas may also better reflect the domestic market for local players, said Qiu Guoyang, assistant general manager at Shenzhen-based brokerage Jinrui Futures.  He expected the ShFE launch to eventually have an impact on options volumes on the LME, which was founded in 1877, although not in the short term.  In an emailed response, the LME said it sees the Chinese market as a complementary trading system \u201cstimulating arbitrage flow and helping to grow the market as a whole.\u201d  CME global head of metals, Young-Jin Chang, also welcomed the new product and noted that 20 percent of its volume originates outside U.S. trading hours, pointing to demand in Asia.  GOING GLOBAL  Underscoring its determination to support the options contract, the ShFE has lined up 18 market makers, to fuel activity, far more than the handful that is usual for international exchanges.  Those include a unit of Jinrui Futures, a subsidiary of Jiangxi Copper Co,, one of China\u2019s biggest copper smelters, and state-run diversified metals firm China Minmetals Corp.  Swiss commodity trading house, Trafigura, which has a China-based trading unit, will also be involved in the first day of trading, a spokesperson said.  Success may depend on whether smelters and fabricators use the home product for hedging or if it becomes a playground for speculative investors, who often dominate other Chinese futures markets, like iron ore and coal, and cause wild volatility in prices, analysts said.  Launching an options contract will also help ShFE garner more traction with international players as it prepares to open its copper futures contract to foreign investors.  ShFE has not given a date for the internationalisation yet.

Spot silver slipped 4.8% to $27.59 an ounce by 0811 GMT, after jumping 7.3% to hit its highest since February 2013 at $30.03 on Monday, as the pack of small-time investors shifted into the market following calls on Reddit and other platforms.

Raising the margins investors must post to trade is a familiar move by CME, the world\u2019s biggest futures and commodities-centric market, when it aims to head off unusual market stress and volatility.  It follows similar moves to cap the market action by some of the easy access online platforms who were the main conduits for the recent surge in videogame retailer GameStop and other U.S. stocks.  Spot gold fell 0.8% to $1,846.04 per ounce. U.S. gold futures shed 0.7% to $1,850.10.

We\u2019ve been developing systems in order to create a forward curve for that product,\u201d Price told Reuters in an interview during LME Week.  \u201cWe\u2019re in talks with several exchanges at the moment. There are a couple of exchanges that are interested in it,\u201d  Price, who is vice chairman of the London Metal Exchange Steel Committee, declined to identify the exchanges.  The LME scrap futures contract is based on bulk consignments into Turkey, but there has been growing trade in scrap delivered in containers and this activity now accounts for between 30% and 40% of global volumes, Price said.  \u201cThe volumes are smaller and there\u2019s a large community of very active trader participants, so it\u2019s ideal in our view for a derivative product,\u201d he said.  Price said his new privately-held firm Mettalex will carry on some of the activities of his former firm Ferrometrics in providing liquidity for steel contracts on the LME, the CME Group and Nasdaq Inc.  \u201cInitially we\u2019re focusing on creating the curve structures on the products we\u2019re involved with. In the second phase, we have additional funding pledged to deploy more systematic trading strategies,\u201d he said.  \u201cOur approach is very much suited to markets in which there is a vacuum in terms of forward pricing.\u201d  Another company is due to be launched in the next few months focusing on research in the steel sector, The Board Report, he added.  Price also founded a new initiative called Pool, an umbrella organization aimed at boosting financial trading in steel, partly by bringing in new participants.  \u201cTo get to the next phase we need to bring more people along and so we\u2019re trying provide services and support,\u201d Price said.","82":"March 15 (Reuters) - CME Group Inc:  * CME CONSIDERS BIDDING FOR MICHAEL SPENCER\u2019S NEX GROUP - BLOOMBERG, CITING SOURCES  * CME AND NEX GROUP HAVE HELD PRELIMINARY TALKS ABOUT A POSSIBLE DEAL - BLOOMBERG, CITING SOURCES Source text : bloom.bg\/2DvchEu Further company coverage:","83":"OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (Reuters) - Global grain merchant Bunge Ltd and U.S. farmer-owned cooperatives hit exchange-operator CME Group Inc with complaints at a regulatory advisory committee meeting on Thursday over private transactions which critics say reduce transparency in agricultural markets.  FILE PHOTO: Men enter the CME Group offices in New York, U.S., October 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  CME, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, began allowing the privately negotiated deals - called block trades - in markets such as corn and wheat in January. Proponents say the transactions help them execute large orders without disrupting prices in thinly traded markets.  But small grain dealers, whose transactions do not meet size requirements for block trades, are frustrated that their orders do not get filled in the central market while block trades are being executed privately, said Joe Barker, a director for broker CHS Hedging.  Concerns about the deals surfaced as the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates the CME Group\u2019s exchanges, held a meeting of its agricultural advisory committee in the farm state of Kansas.  \u201cThe feeling in the country is that there is one set of rules for people that do five lots and another set of rules for people that do 500 lots,\u201d said Barker, who represents an association of farm cooperatives on the CFTC committee. \u201cYou\u2019ve created two different markets.\u201d  Struck away from the broader market, block trades are meant to facilitate dealings in thinly traded contracts, such as deferred months, and help traders execute large-lot orders at a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d single price, according to CME. The trades must exceed exchange-set size limits, be cleared by CME and reported publicly after completion.  Some agricultural traders said, however, that the trades have reduced transparency and fairness by removing business in the central order book, where most transactions are executed, including in actively traded contracts  The heaviest use of block trades in agricultural markets so far has been in corn, where the transactions accounted for 0.28 percent of total volume from Jan. 8 to March 23, according to CME. In agricultural markets overall, block trades represented 0.15 percent of total volume for that time period, CME said.  The CFTC is analyzing whether or not block trading at CME is withdrawing liquidity from agricultural markets, Commissioner Brian Quintenz told Reuters.  \u201cThe bottom line is the markets have to work for everybody,\u201d he said.  Pushback against block trades comes after CME told the CFTC in December that an overwhelming number of market participants were in favor of them. The trades were previously permitted in other markets, including Black Sea wheat and Eurodollars.  CME wants its central order book to remain the primary venue for price discovery and risk management, said Tim Andriesen, managing director of agricultural products at CME Group.  Block trades encourage transparency, he said at the meeting, since unlike over-the-counter transactions, they must be reported to the broader market soon after they are struck.  \u201cWe see a market developing,\u201d Andriesen said about block trades. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at them closely.\u201d  CME\u2019s size requirements for block trades concern some grain handlers, said Stephen Strong, who represents an association of crop exporters on the CFTC committee and works for Bunge\u2019s North American arm.  He also questioned CME\u2019s volume data at the meeting, asking whether block trades represent a bigger slice of overall business on days when traders are executing them actively.  \u201cFor some, really the jury is still out for us as to whether blocks are a good thing or not,\u201d he said.

Workers are seen on an offshore oil platform surrounded by icy waters in Liaodong bay off Liaoning province, China January 18, 2018. REUTERS\/Stringer  Shanghai Crude aims to rival the world\u2019s two crude benchmarks, luring overseas traders with the promise of a deep pool of liquidity and the chance for arbitrage between Asian, U.S. and European markets.  However, the contract will also come with quirks that traders used to London\u2019s Brent or U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) may find less appealing, including shorter business hours, unique Chinese trading habits and extended holiday breaks.  Yuan-denominated trading and a blend of new rules and regulatory burdens will also likely hamper initial take-up on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), executives at a dozen banks and brokers and experts involved in the launch told Reuters.  \u201cThe rules around trading methodology will be unfamiliar for western houses,\u201d said John Browning, chief operating officer of Hong Kong-based futures broker Bands Financial Ltd, which is an approved overseas intermediary for the INE.  \u201cThey\u2019ll have to get to grips with a different set of trading parameters, including initial margin calculation, rolling between months, order cancellations ratios, etc. It\u2019s all very different.\u201d  So far, China has opened more than 6,000 trading accounts, including the country\u2019s oil majors and about 150 brokerages. Ten foreign intermediaries have registered, including J.P.Morgan, Bands Financial, Straits Financial Services and other Hong Kong based affiliates of domestic brokerages.  Last-minute changes are still being made to entice overseas users. On Tuesday, the government said it would waive income taxes for foreign investors for the first three years.  CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS  Specific issues for traders include Shanghai\u2019s shorter trading hours, split into three slots, with the afternoon session ending at 3:00 p.m. local time (0700 GMT), just before London ramps up.  Although the exchange will have an overnight trading session to match late European and early U.S. trading, it will close for more than six hours before trade resumes in Beijing.  This could mean the contract risks having to play catch-up each morning to the moods and swings of Europe and America, rather than setting its own price, several senior futures traders said.  Chinese trading habits may also be a shock to foreign users, they said.  Chinese commodity futures investors do not typically trade steadily over the months, but instead pick specific months in which they deal, due to a different cost structure. That could complicate efforts to trade spreads between Brent, WTI and Shanghai.  These and other factors mean the contract may have a \u201chard time\u201d building correlations with Brent and WTI that would make arbitrage possible, said Albert Helmig, chief executive of financial consultancy Grey House and a former vice chairman of NYMEX.  \u201cIt\u2019s a China market, with Chinese characteristics,\u201d said Helmig.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  FUTURE PLANS  Still, China offers the potential for a deep, liquid market, buoyed by an explosion of interest from mom-and-pop investors that has supported its vast commodities derivative markets from apples to iron ore in Shanghai, Zhengzhou and Dalian.  In 2017, the total traded value of ShFE\u2019s steel derivatives contracts was $4.4 trillion from domestic investors. This compares with global turnover of more than $10 trillion in international oil futures, the world\u2019s biggest commodity market.  Previous attempts at an Asia benchmark have foundered. Contracts set up by the Dubai Mercantile Exchange a decade ago have not matched Brent or WTI, traded on the Intercontinental Exchange ICE.N and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) owned by CME Group CME.O.  China hopes it can do better: with state-controlled oil majors like PetroChina 601857.SS and Sinopec 600028.SS expected to provide liquidity, analysts said the contract has a chance of succeeding even if it faces short-term caution.  \u201cLaunching a new exchange is enormously complex, so if the initial uptake for the contract isn\u2019t that strong, it isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing,\u201d said Bands\u2019 Browning.","86":"NEW YORK (Reuters) -The sharp slide in GameStop Corp shares is stemming the bleeding for short sellers, even though some who bet against the high-flying stock have already exited the trade to cut their losses.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Short sellers saw paper gains of $3.57 billion during Tuesday\u2019s session, as GameStop\u2019s shares dropped 60% to $90, according to analytics firm S3 Partners.  Overall, the last two days have been a relief for remaining bearish GameStop investors, after retail traders pushed the heavily-shorted stock well over $400 a share last week. Silver, another asset involved in the retail-trading frenzy, has been more immune to short squeezes due to a lack of a big position.  Year-to-date realized and unrealized losses for GameStop shorts stood at $9.08 billion, according to S3, less than half of where the combined year-to-date losses stood on Friday morning.  \u201cAre the remaining shorts now making back some of their losses? Absolutely,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3.  But a number of short investors have already covered their bets. The number of GameStop shares shorted fell to 26.09 million, about 1 million less than a day earlier and down more than half in about a week, according to S3. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to win when you\u2019ve already lost half your troops,\u201d Dusaniwsky said. \u201cWe have had a lot of shorts take their losses and walk away from the trade.\u201d  Melvin Capital, the hedge fund at the center of the GameStop drama, lost 53% in January, while Maplelane Capital, another fund that bet against GameStop, had lost roughly 45% in January.  The remaining shorts likely include those who have been betting against the stock for a while and have had an \u201ciron stomach\u201d as the stock soared and \u201cmomentum shorts\u201d who have jumped into the trade more recently as the stock price showed weakness, Dusaniwsky said.  Short interest in GameStop, a measure of the stock\u2019s price and number of shares shorted, stood at $5.81 billion as of Monday\u2019s close, down about 34% from Friday, according to S3. Along with the decline in GameStop shares, silver prices also retreated on Tuesday as the Reddit-driven trading frenzy that has shocked global financial markets appeared to fizzle.  Silver prices in recent days have become an alternate focus in the battle between retail traders and big institutions.  But unlike stocks such as GameStop, analysts said there was no big short position in silver to squeeze.  Banks and silver producers do hold large short positions in U.S. futures markets, but these tend to be balanced against silver holdings elsewhere or future production, meaning they are not exposed to price moves.  Most money managers and speculative investors on the Comex exchange in New York were already long silver before prices began to rise, and so have benefited from rising prices.  What some of the Reddit crowd set out to do was to create a supply squeeze by buying more silver than the market could provide. But most traders say the market remained liquid and there is plenty of silver around.  Silver slid more than 7% on Tuesday after surging on Monday to its highest level since February 2013.","87":"NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - CME Group said on Thursday it planned to launch on May 7 monthly and quarterly futures contracts linked to the reference rates which are aimed as alternatives to the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR).

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Enterprise said bids for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light sweet crude oil produced in the Permian basin will be accepted during the auction on April 4, 2019. The cargo will be exported from Enterprise\u2019s Houston terminal.  The auction comes as the United States heads towards becoming a net exporter of crude and refined fuels consistently after surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia last year as the world\u2019s biggest oil producer. International Energy Agency officials recently estimated that the nation would reach net exporter status by 2021.  Enterprise and CME\u2019s first crude cargo auction was held on March 5 and the winning bid was a 46-cents-per-barrel premium to CME\u2019s newly launched WTI Houston futures contract, for one cargo of about 650,000-850,000 barrels of crude.  A total of 17 participants and buyers from around the world have expressed interest in participating in the auction, CME said.  Commodities merchant Glencore Ltd lifted the first WTI Houston cargo via the auction process and hopes to add liquidity to the contract and auctions going forward, David Keller, crude trader at Glencore said in a statement in March.  From the Permian Basin, Enterprise transports crude oil to Houston through the Midland-to-ECHO pipeline system, which has 575,000 barrels per day (bpd) of capacity.  Traders have said few people globally have adopted the method of auctioning crude export cargoes.  \u201cThe Enterprise auction is interesting,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Sandy Fielden. \u201cThis is packaging crude for export in cargo size lots in order to reduce the hassle of getting crude out of Houston pipelines and onto a ship.\u201d  While Enterprise\u2019s approach cuts back on the effort an exporter has to make to assemble exports by leaving that work to Enterprise for fees, it is likely going to deter producers looking to build long-term relationships with buyers, Fielden said.  \u201cIt\u2019s more of a \u2018spot\u2019 cargo export process than a term deal structure,\u201d he said.","89":"(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE\/ in an Eikon news window)  * FTSE 100 down 1.2 pct  * Micro Focus plummets after CEO quits, revenue outlook cut  * Barclays rises after activist acquires voting rights  * Hammerson jumps after Klepierre approach  By Kit Rees  LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - A plunge in Micro Focus\u2019 share price on a gloomy revenue outlook sent the UK\u2019s top share index down to a two-week low on Monday, with weakness in commodities-related sectors adding pressure.  Barclays jumped around 4 percent after activist investor Sherborne acquired 5 percent of voting rights in the bank.  Investors have been putting pressure on Barclays to become a profitable investment banking force. It has struggled due to low volatility and tougher regulations on capital requirements.  The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was down 1.2 percent at 7,077.00 points by 1005 GMT as materials and energy stocks fell on the back of weaker metals and oil prices.  Shares in software company Micro Focus plummeted 58.5 percent and it was on track for its biggest ever one-day loss after its CEO quit and it cut its revenue outlook.  Micro Focus has had problems stemming from assets it bought from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, on which it spent $8.8 billion in 2017.  \u201cLarge acquisitions are inherently risky as they come with integration challenges. Micro Focus appears to have underestimated these challenges and is now suffering,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said.  Micro Focus fell around 17 percent back in January after a disappointing set of results and outlook.  Elsewhere British mid caps were down just 0.3 percent, outperforming the broader European market, propped up by a 25 percent jump in Hammerson\u2019s shares.  Shares in the UK retail landlord rose following news that it had been approached by French shopping centre operator Klepierre earlier in the month.  Hammerson rejected Klepierre\u2019s takeover bid, valued at 4.88 billion pounds ($6.80 billion), saying it \u201cvery significantly\u201d undervalued the company.  As Brexit uncertainties continue to weigh on UK stocks, overseas businesses have found cheaper UK companies attractive takeover targets.  \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that large UK companies are being staked out by potential overseas interest,\u201d Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said.  \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of undervaluation creeping in because of potential threats around Brexit, real or imagined, and that can make companies quite attractive, and then many are willing sellers because of the same reason,\u201d Odeluga added, pointing to CME\u2019s bid for NEX Group last week.","90":"LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - Euro-denominated government bond, repurchase agreement and foreign exchange trading at CME Group has moved from London to Amsterdam to avoid disruption from Brexit, the exchange said on Monday.

FILE PHOTO: Bank underground station in front of the Bank of England and Royal Exchange Building in London, Britain, July 30, 2020. REUTERS\/John Sibley\/File Photo  Clearing ensures financial market trades are completed even if one side of the transaction goes bust. It is a high-volume, low-margin business but a critical part of market infrastructure. London\u2019s leading role in the clearing business has helped to cement its status as Europe\u2019s top financial centre.  Other European centres, such as Frankfurt, keen to claw back a chunk of this business, saw Brexit as a chance to reduce London\u2019s grip on clearing euro-denominated trades.  But Deutsche Boerse's DB1Gn.DE Eurex Clearing, considered the strongest candidate to take business from the London Stock Exchange\u2019s clearing division LCH, said its euro clearing had grown more slowly than expected due to delays in regulation changes, the COVID-19 pandemic and a broader reticence by banks to shift from London.  \u201cThere is a slower growth path than we initially had expected for the second half of this year primarily due to COVID-19 and its implications, but everything is going in the right direction to achieve our goals,\u201d Eurex Clearing board member Matthias Graulich told Reuters. Eurex said it accounts for 19 trillion euros (17 trillion pounds) of the total market of 100 trillion euros in notional outstanding value in euro interest rate derivatives and forward contracts, with LCH taking the rest.  In swaps alone, Eurex has 7.3 trillion euros, or 14% of the market, compared with 45.8 trillion euros at LCH. Eurex has a goal of reaching an overall euro clearing target of 25 trillion euros by the end of 2020.  \u201cIt is extremely difficult to say where we are on the journey to achieve our goals by 31 Dec, a year-end is not a magic date if you are building a business, it is more relevant that the trajectory is up and we make month-by-month progress,\u201d Graulich said.  He said a new rule that requires market participants like asset managers to provide margin - a form of deposit - against swap trades for the first time will lead to greater use of Eurex by new customers.  But the rule has been delayed by a year to September 2021 due to COVID-19. Graulich also said several banks had put off plans to close swaps positions in London and reopen them in Frankfurt when the pandemic was disrupting markets and while many traders were working from home.  The LSE said there had been no discernible shift in clearing from London. Lawyers said banks will not move positions from London to Frankfurt voluntarily because of costs and complexity at a time when they are firefighting the pandemic.  Given the lack of movement, the EU is set to decide in the next few weeks on the length of time it will allow LCH\u2019s clearing of euro swaps for EU customers to continue after Britain\u2019s full access to the EU ends in December.  \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see why the EU is playing around with a time limit because Catch 22 remains in full force with banks not moving positions unless ordered to,\u201d said Simon Gleeson, a financial services lawyer at Clifford Chance.  There is a political cost for Britain to maintain EU access for its financial services industry - the Bank of England will have to allow EU securities watchdog ESMA to jointly supervise LCH.  The BoE has said \u201cmultiple hands on the wheel\u201d in a crisis could create confusion. The Bank said this month that clarity was needed by the end of September to avoid market disruption.  ESMA said it was working to ensure timely access decisions.  Some loss of London\u2019s clearing business to the EU is seen as inevitable once the pandemic has passed.  Graulich said the EU wants power over business like euro clearing and that the amounts of business cleared inside and outside the EU will affect decisions on access for Britain.  \u201cThe EU needs to develop its own financial market eco-system with Brexit now ultimately happening. Taking a five to ten year perspective, it is success critical for the EU.\u201d","93":"A general view shows the German share prize index DAX board during afternoon trading as markets react on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, March 25, 2020.

Frustrated with Swiss foot-dragging, the European Commission will not propose extending the equivalence regime that lets EU investors trade on Swiss bourses, effectively ending it as of July 1, an EU diplomat told Reuters on Friday.  Friday was the deadline for the Commission to make such a proposal, but it will refrain from doing so because Bern did not endorse a partnership treaty with the EU that had been negotiated for years, the diplomat said.  The move by its biggest trading partner will prompt retaliation from Bern, which last year drew up contingency plans to block by decree trading of Swiss shares on EU-based exchanges.  \u201cShould the EU not extend Swiss exchanges\u2019 access to the EU market Switzerland would activate the protective measures decided on 8 June 2018 with effect from the end of June,\u201d a government spokesman said by email.  The blue-chip Swiss Market Index ended down 0.6% but off session lows shortly before the market close.  BREXIT IN THE BACKGROUND  Bern\u2019s request this month for \u201cclarifications\u201d on three areas - protecting wages, regulating state aid and defining the rights of EU citizens in Switzerland -- is seen in Brussels as demands to reopen the treaty text, which the EU refuses to do.  Granting stock market equivalence is the EU\u2019s major leverage in trying to get the Swiss to finally sign off on the pact, but Switzerland\u2019s foreign minister has said repeatedly Bern will not be rushed into any deal although it remains open for talks.  The Swiss measures could make volume swell on the SIX Swiss Exchange -- Europe\u2019s fourth-largest -- at least temporarily.  Exchange industry officials say EU investors would still be able to trade Swiss shares, but only through a broker that is a member of the Swiss exchange in Zurich, rather than having a choice of exchanges like Aquis, Cboe and Turquoise that help to drive down prices.  These other platforms now account for nearly a third of the trading volume for Swiss stocks including heavyweights like Nestle, Roche and Novartis.  Although the loss of trading access granted under an equivalence regime would also have broad financial repercussions for the 28-country EU, it was seen as inevitable in Brussels after years of inconclusive negotiations.  The hardening of the EU stance is also partly linked to parallel talks under way with Britain over Brexit, as a lenient approach to the Swiss could encourage London to seek softer terms.  The treaty would have non-EU member Switzerland routinely adopt EU single market rules, create a more efficient platform to resolve disputes, and pave the way for new trade deals, such as for an electricity union.  But ahead of Swiss parliamentary elections in October, it has drawn resistance from across the Swiss political spectrum for infringing national sovereignty.","97":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Large acquisitions in the fragmented financial data industry are just a foretaste of the dealmaking to come, as vendors seek to expand their offerings and secure resources to invest in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, investment bankers and analysts say.

The data vendors also need scale to splash out on technological innovations such as artificial intelligence and machine learning that can keep pace with the needs of their financial and corporate clients, from high-speed trading to big-data crunching.  \u201cWithout significant moves to enhance their businesses, these firms are less able to move quickly to mitigate their risk of loss,\u201d Burton-Taylor wrote in a report last week.  Bloomberg declined to comment. CME, Nasdaq, MarketAxess, Factset, MSCI and Tradeweb did not respond to requests for comment.  AVERSION TO ACQUISITIONS  Last year, Refinitiv entered into a $27 billion agreement to be sold to London Stock Exchange Group Plc, while S&P Global Inc clinched a $44 billion deal last week to acquire IHS Markit Ltd .Thomson Reuters Corp, the parent of Reuters News, owns a 45% stake in Refinitiv and will own about 15% of London Stock Exchange once that deal closes in early 2021. Intercontinental Exchange , the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, and another substantial player in financial markets data, said in August it would acquire mortgage technology platform Ellie Mae for $11 billion, extending its real estate capabilities.  Michael Bloomberg, the founder of the eponymous financial data behemoth, has eschewed large dealmaking thus far. Excluding a transaction where a stake in the company was bought back from another party, Bloomberg\u2019s largest ever acquisition was that of Bureau of National Affairs Inc, a provider of legal, tax and regulatory information, in 2011 for $962 million.  This reflects Bloomberg\u2019s faith in the enduring success of its terminal business, the software that provides business information and connects users that has become ubiquitous in the finance and corporate world, according to investment bankers who have for years been pitching potential deals to the company.  Bloomberg\u2019s competitors have not been able to displace it as the financial data market leader. It has made the terminal synonymous to having a business desktop, akin to referencing Google as shorthand for internet searching or Zoom for video conferencing calling.  Yet while the terminal\u2019s dominance is not under threat, the company\u2019s growth prospects are, industry experts and analysts said. The trading floors at Wall Street firms that powered Bloomberg\u2019s meteoric rise are no longer expanding, and some of its customers who need niche information are moving to data vendors that charge less than the terminal\u2019s $20,000-plus annual subscription.  Bloomberg will have to overcome its aversion to big acquisitions in order to diversify its revenue while its terminal business is still strong, the bankers and analysts said.  \u201cStrategically they may want to look beyond their current industry by expanding into verticals, including the energy and technology industry, or providing more data to current customers,\u201d said Jeff Silber, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.  Bloomberg declined to comment.  Another clock ticking for Bloomberg is its founder, a major philanthropist and former candidate for U.S. president. The 78-year-old mogul, whose fortune is pegged by Forbes at $55 billion, has led the company on and off as chief executive for four decades. He has resisted investment bankers\u2019 pitches for an initial public offering that would allow him to sell down his roughly 90% stake and for his employees to sell company shares they have been awarded in the open market.  Michael Bloomberg could not be reached for comment.  EXCHANGES ON THE HUNT FOR DEALS  CME Group, the world\u2019s biggest futures exchange operator, may look to diversify its revenue as persistently low interest rates reduce demand for its hedging products through futures on rates, commodities and currencies.  CME did not respond to requests for comment.  Nasdaq has said it wants to expand its market technology and information services businesses. Last month, it agreed to buy fraud detection platform Verafin for $2.75 billion, another milestone in its push to diversify revenue stream away from trading.  Nasdaq did not respond to a request for comment.  Marketaxess, an operator of fixed income trading platforms, made two small purchases in the third quarter which extended its trading, data, and post-trade businesses, and analysts have said it is seeking to diversify further.  Marketaxess did not respond to a request for comment.","98":"(Adds Bank of England reaction)  LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Most banking, insurance and other financial firms in Britain would be cut off from the European Union if there is a no-deal Brexit, the bloc\u2019s executive body said on Wednesday.  Financial services are Britain\u2019s most important tax-earning sector, with the EU its biggest customer.  The European Commission set out its contingency plans in the event of Britain crashing out of the bloc next March without securing a divorce settlement and transition period.  \u201cIf the Withdrawal Agreement is not ratified, financial operators established in the United Kingdom will lose, as of the withdrawal date, the right to provide their services in the EU27 member states under the EU financial services passports,\u201d it said in a statement.  Brussels said it was only taking preventive action to ensure EU customers could continue clearing derivatives transactions at UK operators like LCH for a year from March, and use central securities depositories in Britain for two years.  \u201cThe commission has concluded that EU27 companies need this time to have in place fully viable alternatives to UK operators.\u201d  It also gave EU market participants time to shift derivatives contracts from Britain to the EU without being caught up with margining requirements.  \u201cFor their part, clients in the European Union of UK firms need to prepare for a scenario in which their provider is no longer subject to EU law,\u201d the commission said.  This contrasts with Britain\u2019s decision to offer broad access for banking, insurance and other financial services from EU firms in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The Bank of England said it welcomed the move by Brussels to allow clearing to continue, but that practical arrangements to implement the decision still needed to be put in place.  \u201cThis includes agreeing the necessary cooperation and information-sharing arrangements between the Bank and the European Securities and Markets Authority,\u201d the BoE said.  The BoE had also wanted EU contingency plans to include legal \u201ccontinuity\u201d of cross-border insurance contracts.  \u201cWhile the action on derivatives is welcome it is extraordinary that the EU authorities will act to help major financial institutions, but not millions of ordinary people living in Europe whose insurance and pension contracts happen to be held in the UK,\u201d said Hugh Savill, director of regulation at the Association of British Insurers.  Catherine McGuinness, leader of the City of London financial district, said the commission also needed to address significant \u201ccliff edge\u201d risks for data transfers and contract continuity for uncleared derivatives.  Markus Ferber, a senior member of the European Parliament\u2019s economic affairs committee, said actions on derivatives will not be enough as the question of legal liability remains unanswered.  \u201cThe European Commission has to disclose the underlying cooperation agreements with UK supervisors. Furthermore it has to answer the question if and up to what level the European Central Bank will have to provide emergency liquidity assistance in a crisis scenario,\u201d Ferber said.  Many financial firms in Britain are pushing ahead to open new hubs in the bloc before March to ensure continuity of services for EU customers, irrespective of what form Brexit takes.

An oil tanker unloads crude oil at a crude oil terminal in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, China July 4, 2018. Picture taken July 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Stringer  Responding to a report by Reuters earlier on Thursday, the INE, part of the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE), said in an email that it was studying introducing a market-maker scheme following requests from some investors.  The exchange has approached at least two major brokers in recent weeks about finding investors to help drum up business in the less-active forward months, two sources familiar with the matter said.  Those investors would be similar to market makers, who are often deployed by international exchanges such as CME Group Inc and Intercontinental Exchange to fuel activity in new contracts.  \u201cIn recent days, some market investors have asked the exchange to follow practices from other international exchanges and introduce the market making scheme to further provide liquidity for forward month contracts,\u201d the INE said.  \u201cWe are seriously considering the request and demands from investors and are currently studying and seeking advice from investors for a plan,\u201d the exchange said.  The potential candidates for the role would be institutional investors, such as wealth managers and hedge funds, the sources said. The sources declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media.  The move comes amid worries among investors and brokers that liquidity in the market is concentrated in the September contract, which expires at the end of this month.  September\u2019s expiry is seen as a big test of China\u2019s first yuan-denominated oil contract, which was launched four months ago aimed at gaining greater clout in global crude pricing.  \u201cMore investors will roll their September contracts into December in the coming weeks. Right now, liquidity in December is not high enough to attract big investors,\u201d said Wang Xiao, head of crude oil research with Guotai Junan Futures.  State-controlled oil majors have helped provide liquidity, but getting a commitment from other investors to do so would enhance efforts to increase interest in the market.  (For a graphic on 'China's crude liquidity boost' click reut.rs\/2KiPBug)  PLACES THIRD IN TURNOVER  Monthly exchange data shows that turnover in the contract has surged since its launch. In July, it accounted for 7 percent of global turnover in oil futures, taking third place behind London\u2019s Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI), with Arab oil heavyweight Dubai in fourth.  But most of the daily turnover and open interest, a measure of liquidity, is concentrated in the September contract, which expires at the end of this month. The December contract has a cluster of activity, but the drop-off is steep.  Chinese commodity futures investors do not typically trade steadily over the months, but instead pick specific months in which they deal.  That complicates efforts to trade spreads between Brent, WTI and Shanghai.  \u201cThe monthly gap between Shanghai contracts and global oil futures created difficulties for arbitrage,\u201d said Wang.  Having more liquidity spread out across forward months is considered important for luring international hedge funds and other financial players, who like to trade month by month.  Open interest across the first five months of the Brent and WTI contracts <0#LCO:> and <0#CL:> is relatively evenly spread out.  INE slashed fees for the October and November contracts last month and on Tuesday cut them for the January and February months, which was seen as an effort to make liquidity spread out more evenly across forward months and to engage in industrial traders such as refiners who tend to trade month by month, the INE said.  Combined open interest in those four contracts was just 445 lots on Thursday, equivalent to just under 500,000 barrels of oil and tiny in comparison to September which has almost 14,000 lots of open interest.

Pumpjacks are seen at an oil field in Huaian, Jiangsu province, China November 11, 2017. REUTERS\/Stringer  The exchange said on Friday it had set the opening price for the front month of its crude futures contract launching on Monday at 416 yuan ($65.80) per barrel.  WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS AMONG FOREIGN INVESTORS?  * Worries include how to freely exchange the yuan because of a Chinese clampdown on capital outflows, while some concerns remain about Beijing\u2019s heavy handed intervention in its commodity markets in recent years, traders and analysts said.  The obligation to trade Shanghai crudes in yuan will also add a currency risk to the market, which some traders are reluctant to take.  * The Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), the unit of ShFE running the contract, has strict daily limits on the number of canceled orders allowed per account, aimed at curbing spoofing. This involves placing bids to buy or offers to sell futures contracts with the intent to cancel them before execution. By creating an illusion of demand, spoofers can influence prices to benefit their market positions.  For a larger client placing orders of more than 300 lots, equivalent to 30,000 barrels of oil, the limit is 50 a day. Users with smaller orders are allowed 500 cancellations.  That\u2019s different to international exchanges, like the CME, which uses a ratio based on an investor\u2019s traded volume.  On days when price volatility and volumes are high, overseas investors new to Chinese markets could get penalised if they exceed those restrictions as they try to adjust their positions, traders say.  * Chinese commodity futures investors do not typically trade steadily over the months, but instead pick specific months in which they deal. That could complicate efforts to trade spreads between Brent, WTI and Shanghai.  Take iron ore <0#DCIO:>, one of China\u2019s most-active futures markets: most of the more than 2.3 million lots of open interest are in May and September contracts, with delivery months in between ranging from tens of thousands of lots to in some cases fewer than 10.  In contrast, liquidity across the first five months of the Brent and WTI contracts <0#LCO:> <0#CL:> is relatively evenly spread out, reflecting their popularity among hedge funds and other financial players, who like to trade month by month.  * There will be a 1.5-hour gap between the settlement and a price published by price reporting agency S&P Global Platts, which provides a price assessment for the region at 4:30 p.m. Singapore time in what it calls the Market On Close (MOC) process, which is closely watched by the industry.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING CHINA\u2019S NATIONAL HOLIDAYS?  Trading will stop for China\u2019s week-long national holidays - Spring Festival and Golden Week - leaving the Shanghai market out of synch with the Western exchanges.  Shorter trading hours - with three slots each day - compared with almost 24 hours on Western exchanges mean the market may sometimes play catch-up with the rest of the world.  WHO WILL USE IT IN THE DOMESTIC INDUSTRY?  China has opened more than 6,000 trading accounts, including the country\u2019s oil majors and about 150 brokerages. Ten foreign intermediaries have registered, including JPMorgan, Bands Financial, Straits Financial Services and other Hong Kong-based affiliates of domestic brokerages.  It will likely attract mainly \u2018mon-and-pop\u2019 speculative investors, who dominate the country\u2019s other often volatile commodity futures markets from dates to iron ore, although transaction fees for crude are relatively high.  China\u2019s independent refineries are more likely to process heavy crude instead of the medium-sour crude traded in futures, a Shandong-based crude trader said.  At least three independent refineries that are looking to use the contract for hedging also said they were unsure about delivery. Under the rules, buyers cannot choose a specific grade that will be delivered or the location of the warehouse for delivery.  HOW DO FOREIGN USERS OPEN A TRADING ACCOUNT?  Foreign investors will need to open a non-residential bank account with one of the eight banks that handle margin deposits for yuan crude futures, according to INE.  The banks are Agricultural Bank of China, CITIC Bank, China Construction Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Merchant Bank and the Development Bank of Singapore.  Investors will need to transfer money from that bank account to an account opened with either a domestic broker or foreign broker or agencies registered with the INE. The broker will open two accounts with INE: one for margin deposit and one for settlement for foreign currencies.  WHAT ARE DOMESTIC BROKERS DOING TO ATTRACT CLIENTS?  Many big and small brokers such as COFCO and Zhaojin Futures have waived their transaction fees to crude oil clients and will provide free consulting services as well as free training in a bid to win more customers, sources at brokers told Reuters.  COFCO and Zhaojin declined to comment.  Huatai Futures is offering over-the-counter crude oil options, Zhang Huiyao, deputy manager of the firm\u2019s crude department, told Reuters. In January, the broker added six staff to its China-based crude oil team, which was set up last October, so it can reach more potential clients, she said.","102":"LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has sparked a global debate by suggesting New York\u2019s trading day could be shortened for a time to help calm stock markets rocked by coronavirus.  So far only stock markets in the Philippines and Sri Lanka appear to have opted for a suspension, with no major financial centre following suit, although four European Union countries have temporarily banned short-selling of shares.  IS IT RARE TO SUSPEND?  Markets have been closed many times, in many different countries and for many different reasons that have made pricing shares temporarily unreliable.  The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), for example, closed for four days following the 9\/11 attacks in 2001, for two days during a severe hurricane in 2012, and for the rest of the day after President John F Kennedy\u2019s assassination in 1963.  Greece shut its stock market for nearly five weeks in 2015 at the height of its debt crisis. China kept a lot of its markets closed for longer than usual over the Lunar New Year.  Although markets did not close during the 2008 global financial crisis, there are concerns that with many dealers having to work from back up sites or home, volumes could be patchier during the coronavirus outbreak. Brokers in Australia have been asked to trade less to ease the strain.  HOW WOULD A SHUTDOWN START?  A shutdown could be ordered by governments, or by securities regulators who are legally obliged to close markets if they no longer believe they are orderly enough to produce reliable prices for investors.  WHICH MARKETS CAN BE SHUT?  Suspensions have traditionally focused on stock markets as that is where small investors are most exposed.  There are already roadbumps known as circuit breakers to deal with extremes in trading, and they have been triggered several times on the NYSE in recent sessions to halt dealings for a few minutes.  The closure of stock exchanges would affect other markets like derivatives and bonds given close links between them.  But not all trading in shares, derivatives and bonds are done on exchanges, with large volumes executed \u201cover the counter\u201d or OTC, and bilaterally between banks or between banks and their biggest customers like asset managers.  OTC trading would need to be stopped as well to avoid users having an unfair advantage over other market participants. OTC trading base prices stem in many cases from exchanges.  Some of the biggest moves are being seen in the currency market as investors dump sterling and other currencies in favour of the dollar, but there is no talk of suspending trading in what is a $5 trillion, 24-hour-a-day market.  DOES IT HAVE TO BE COORDINATED?  For an orderly shutdown, there would need to be some coordination among leading financial centres in the United States, Europe, Japan and China. This could be done through the Group of 20 Economies (G20), an umbrella body for global regulators like the Financial Stability Board.  To be effective, speedy consensus would be needed to avoid countries going it alone and creating confusion or disparities. Some big companies are listed in several countries.  WHAT ARE THE RISKS?  Failure to get consensus for coordinated action would create a patchwork of responses with potentially reduced impact.  Four EU countries have gone ahead with bans on short selling but others have refused to follow suit. The bans have not stopped a broad market rout in shares across Europe.  Derivatives exchanges say that halting trading could trigger contractual clauses with the potential to generate defaults.  There is also the risk of even bigger falls once an exchange reopens: the leading stock index in the Philippines sank by nearly a quarter when the exchange reopened on Thursday after a two-day suspension.  WHO WANTS ONE?  So far no major politician or central banker has called for suspension in trading.  Exchanges in Europe, the United States and Hong Kong have rejected the idea of suspending trading, saying that closing markets won\u2019t address the underlying cause of volatility, worries over how much coronavirus will damage the economy.  Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Wednesday that as long as markets are not out of control, then keeping them open is important. The London Stock Exchange has said it has no plans to suspend trading.  Stacey Cunningham, president of NYSE, said that despite closing the trading floor, where dealers work shoulder-to-shoulder, to avoid infection, electronic trading will continue under normal hours.  Terry Duffy, chief executive of CME, the world\u2019s biggest derivatives exchange, said markets are global and closures or shortening hours would simply send investors elsewhere.  Malaysia\u2019s Securities Commission and stock exchange said on Thursday that markets would stay open, despite calls from stockbrokers for a shutdown.

(Compiled by Diptendu Lahiri and Akshara P in Bengaluru)","104":"(Adds context, quote)  LONDON, April 7 (Reuters) - Gold stocks held in New York vaults registered with CME Group have jumped almost 50% since the end of last week after the exchange launched a new contract and a price premium since the outbreak of the coronavirus encouraged stockpiling.  The premium on CME\u2019s Comex exchange over spot gold traded in London rose sharply again on Tuesday as supply routes remained partially closed and banks and brokers wary of the price gap reduced trading.  CME said late on Monday that gold stocks in Comex-registered vaults totalled 15.9 million ounces, a record high and their highest level since ever and worth around $26 billion.  Of the new arrivals, 4.8 million ounces were 400-ounce bars of the type used in London, which cannot be delivered against Comex\u2019s main gold futures but are eligible for new contracts launched on Monday to address the supply concerns.  Gold futures on Comex leaped above London spot prices two weeks ago after coronavirus control measures grounded passenger airlines on which gold usually shipped and closed several major precious metals refineries.  Traders feared it would be impossible to ship gold from London, a major storage centre, to settle contract obligations in New York, where much more gold trades than is stored.  Adding to the difficulty, Comex\u2019s main gold futures run on 100-ounce bars, meaning 400-ounce bars from London must be melted down and recast, usually in Switzerland, before shipping to New York.  Higher prices create an incentive to move metal, and the stockpile in Comex-registered vaults has surged from 11 million ounces at the end of last week and less than 9 million ounces two weeks ago, CME data showed.  But worries over settlement of the existing futures persist, despite CME saying it will offer instruments to link it with its new contract.  The premium for the most-traded June contract rose to $50 - or 3% - above London spot gold from around $25 in recent days.  There are currently 357,369 of these contracts active representing 35.7 million ounces of gold for delivery in June.  \u201cCapacity in the market is massively lower and risk appetite is massively lower,\u201d said a source at a gold-trading bank in London.  More gold was on its way to New York and Comex stocks would continue to rise, they said. Traders also said the partial reopening of several Swiss refiners this week would increase supply.  Investors on Comex typically do not take delivery of gold, using the exchange instead to gain exposure to gold prices and rolling their positions forward to future months.

A bitcoin (virtual currency) coin placed on Dollar banknotes, next to computer keyboard, is seen in this illustration picture, November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in January that \u201csignificant investor protection issues\u201d needed to be examined before bitcoin-based ETFs could be offered and it also had concerns around how the products would be priced, stored and safeguarded.  Cboe\u2019s letter said the exchange believes \u201cthat the vast majority of these concerns can be addressed within the existing framework for commodity-related funds related to valuation, liquidity, custody, arbitrage, and manipulation.\u201d The March 23 letter was signed by Cboe President Chris Concannon.  Bitcoin can be moved around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without a central authority such as a bank or government. The a virtual currency\u2019s 1,500 percent surge last year stoked investor demand.  Cboe believes ETFs would give investors a more transparent and accessible way to get exposure to cryptocurrencies than the spot market.  Yet bitcoin has been volatile, swinging from a 2018 high of $17,234.99 on Jan. 6 to a low of $5,920.72 on Feb. 6, and trading on Monday at about $8,092. Many investors remain leery, and the SEC has been cautious due to several massive cybersecurity breaches that have hit bitcoin owners and exchanges and a lack of consistent treatment of the assets by governments.  The regulator has denied or tabled more than a dozen proposals for funds that would own bitcoin or futures based on them, including four separate proposals submitted by Cboe, such as the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.  Cboe and rival CME Group Inc have successfully launched cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts, however, which the exchange operators self-certified in December and are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Cboe asked the SEC to evaluate each cryptocurrency fund and underlying cryptocurrency-related holdings on a case-by-case basis.  More than $70 billion in notional value of bitcoin transactions traded hands in the spot market in December, when the price reached more than $19,000, Cboe said. Such liquidity would easily support bitcoin ETFs or other exchange-traded products (ETPs), the exchange said.  \u201cAs the volumes continue to grow, especially on regulated U.S. markets, the overall spot bitcoin market looks more and more like a traditional commodity market and Cboe continues to believe that the spot market is sufficiently liquid to support a bitcoin ETP.\u201d","106":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Agriculture Department will investigate why a surge in beef prices because of coronavirus hoarding did not translate into higher cattle prices for farmers, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said on Wednesday.  FILE PHOTO: Steak is pictured in New York March 11, 2015. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  The investigation adds scrutiny on the small group of meat companies like Tyson Foods Inc and Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] that dominate U.S. beef processing.  \u201cThis is a good decision to address potentially unfair practices,\u201d Republican U.S. Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska said on Twitter.  The investigation will expand a probe the USDA launched into the beef market in August after a fire that shut a Tyson Foods plant in Holcomb, Kansas, sent beef prices soaring and tanked cattle prices. The agency has not released the results of the investigation that began last year.  Tyson Foods said it would cooperate with the USDA.  \u201cDuring the current pandemic and following the fire at our Holcomb, Kansas, facility last August, we have taken steps to minimize the impact each situation had on our producers, production volume and our ability to cover customer needs,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.  Cargill did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company said previously it had been a committed buyer in the cash market for cattle, to the benefit of farmers.  U.S. senators asked the Justice Department last month to investigate whether beef processors engaged in price-fixing during the coronavirus pandemic.  The National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, an industry group, separately called for the USDA to work with the Justice Department to investigate whether \u201cinappropriate influence occurred in the markets.\u201d The association also asked the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to assess speculation in CME Group Inc\u2019s cattle futures to determine whether they \u201cremain a useful risk-management tool\u201d for farmers.  \u201cUSDA\u2019s Packers and Stockyards Division will be extending our oversight to determine the causes of divergence between box and live beef prices, beginning with the Holcomb Fire in KS last summer and now with COVID-19,\u201d Perdue said on Twitter.","107":"(Updates Suzano Papel e Celulose, Edelweiss Financial Services, Qualcomm, Johnson & Johnson; adds SQM, Providence)  March 16 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2100 GMT on Friday:  ** Chile\u2019s new government is evaluating whether to support a petition filed by its predecessor to block the sale of a stake in top lithium miner SQM, to a Chinese firm, a senior government official told Reuters.  ** Buyout group Providence is moving ahead with plans to pull out of German home shopping TV network HSE24, which it plans to sell or float on the Frankfurt stock exchange before the summer, several people close to matter said.  ** Britain\u2019s NEX Group Plc said it had received a preliminary takeover approach from U.S.-based exchange operator CME Group, in a move to create a cross-border trading powerhouse.  ** French cosmetics group L\u2019Oreal said it was buying Canadian beauty technology company ModiFace, as it looks to roll out more digital services such as virtual make-up tests.  ** Germany\u2019s Lanxess has dropped out of a consortium bidding for Akzo Nobel\u2019s speciality chemicals business, two people close to the matter said.  ** Anglo-South African financial services group Old Mutual is selling three businesses in Latin America to China Minsheng Investment Group International (CMIG) for around $300 million, a source familiar with the matter said.  ** Wynn Resorts Ltd\u2019s former chief executive, Steve Wynn, may elect to sell all or a portion of his stake in the company, according to a regulatory filing dated Thursday.  ** Brazil\u2019s Suzano Papel e Celulose SA won the battle to acquire larger rival Fibria Celulose SA, creating the world\u2019s biggest wood pulp producer while shelving expansion plans.  ** India\u2019s Edelweiss Financial Services\u2019 agreed acquisition of the securities business of Religare Enterprises has fallen through because Religare failed to get the necessary regulatory approvals, the suitor said.  ** Qualcomm Inc\u2019s board of directors was meeting on Friday to discuss former executive chairman Paul Jacobs stepping down after he told the U.S. semiconductor company he was exploring acquiring it, people familiar with the matter said.  ** Royal Dutch Shell Plc is selling its upstream assets in New Zealand to Austria\u2019s OMV AG for $578 million, the companies said on Thursday.  ** Johnson & Johnson said it was offered about $2.1 billion for its LifeScan Inc unit, which makes blood glucose monitoring products, by private equity firm Platinum Equity, another step towards exiting the diabetes device market.  ** A top 30 shareholder in British engineering company GKN plans to reject a hostile takeover bid from industrial turnaround specialist Melrose, the latest voice to back GKN as the bid battle intensifies.  ** Japan Tobacco has agreed to buy Russia\u2019s Donskoy Tabak for about 90 billion roubles ($1.56 billion) to strengthen its leading position in the world\u2019s third-largest tobacco market.  ** Lundbeck agreed to buy Prexton Therapeutics, a specialist in treatments for brain disorders, in a deal potentially worth $1.1 billion, the Danish drugmaker said.

The Spanish bourse, whose shares jumped by more than a third in early trading, said the Swiss offer \u201creasonably reflected\u201d its current value.  With European sector leaders Deutsche Boerse and London Stock Exchange effectively too big to consolidate without raising serious competition concerns, exchange mergers are focusing on smaller players, with Euronext having already scooped up the Dublin and Oslo exchanges.  SIX has offered to buy BME for 34 euros per share, implying a total equity value of 2.843 billion euros ($3.13 billion), a hefty premium over BME\u2019s market capitalisation of just over 2 billion euros before the offer was announced.  The deal was \u201cvery much\u201d about growing the revenues of both businesses, SIX Chief Executive Jos Dijsselhof told reporters on Monday.  Shares of BME, among the smallest of Europe\u2019s exchanges, were up 37% at 34.8 euros by 1040 GMT.  We believe the terms of the offer to be difficult to refuse,\u201d analysts at Spanish bank BBVA said. Euronext, which has a market cap of around 5 billion euros, had denied earlier this month that it was bidding for BME. It has not disclosed an offer price. Taking over BME would not dramatically alter the overall exchange landscape, but would help to buttress SIX or Euronext. Euronext is a minnow compared to LSE and Deutsche Bourse which both have market capitalisations of well over 20 billion euros.  But it has gradually built up scale in share trading, and now operates exchanges in Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, France and Ireland, with Spain an obvious gap.  Euronext shares were up 1.5% at 72.95 euros.  SIX is focused on Switzerland and buying BME would give it a base inside the European Union. That would help Switzerland regain direct access to the EU after Brussels blocked EU-based investors from trading on Swiss exchanges from July this year as a row escalated over a stalled bilateral treaty.  SIX, whose offer for BME is a friendly one, said its proposed purchase would be financed through a combination of existing cash resources and access to capital markets.  Madrid\u2019s government would likely need reassurances that jobs would not be lost in Spain if trading in Spanish shares migrated to a central platform run by SIX or Euronext.  BME said it would keep its current business activities, Spanish headquarters and local strategy for a four-year transitional period at least.

Trading was dampened by the week-long Lunar New Year holiday which has closed markets in China.  Asia stocks were barely moved, staying near a four-month high after Wall Street\u2019s tepid pre-weekend performance, while the dollar was supported against the yen following strong U.S. jobs and manufacturing data.  COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell $6 a tonne, or 0.1 percent, to $6,133 a tonne by 0240 GMT.  FACTORY ACTIVITY: China\u2019s factory activity shrank by the most in almost three years in January as new orders slumped further and output fell, a private survey showed, reinforcing fears that a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy is deepening.  HOLIDAYS: \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of trading activity because of Lunar New Year holidays in China,\u201d said Helen Lau, analyst, Argonaut Securities. \u201cChina\u2019s slowing manufacturing is weighing on metals markets.\u201d  TRADE DEAL: Expectations of a trade deal between Washington and Beijing kept a floor under the market. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet China\u2019s Xi Jinping soon to try to seal a comprehensive trade deal, citing substantial progress.  JOBS DATA: A U.S. Labor Department report on Friday showed nonfarm payrolls jumped by a stronger-than-forecast 304,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since February 2018. That report, along with better-than-expected ISM manufacturing activity numbers for January, pointed to underlying strength in the world\u2019s biggest economy.  DEAL: Top copper miner Codelco said it had struck a contract deal with the union of supervisors at its Gabriela Mistral mine in northern Chile, averting the threat of a strike.

FILE PHOTO: A financial trader works at their desk at CMC Markets in the City of London, Britain, April 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Peter Nicholls  The LSE said there are no plans for the new Amsterdam offshoot of its Turquoise pan-European platform to start up next month, while Aquis, which set up a hub in Paris, said trading in euro shares would continue in London for now.  \u201cTo do anything else at this point would unnecessarily fragment liquidity and, not surprisingly, there has been no member push for this,\u201d an Aquis official said.  The LSE, Aquis and Cboe Europe, the region\u2019s biggest cross-border share trading platform, created EU hubs in case their London operations get cut off from customers in the bloc after Brexit, which is now due to take place on January 31.  Brexit raised the spectre of London being sidelined in trading euro-denominated shares after transactions in euro-denominated fixed income moved to the bloc in March 2019.  But Britain will now leave the EU with a settlement that includes a transition period to December, meaning continued unfettered access for London-based financial firms.  Cboe Europe has already started up its new Amsterdam hub and although volumes remain negligible, its president David Howson said it will remain open despite the transition period.  Volume in euro shares could start moving from its London unit to the Netherlands if uncertainty over Britain\u2019s direct access to EU investors after transition grows.  \u201cAs things evolve throughout the year, we will get clarity on equivalence (EU market access)... Depending on what that time horizon looks like, we will look to differentiate and induce volumes to potentially go there,\u201d Howson said.  Amsterdam will be a base for building up the U.S. exchange operator\u2019s plans to expand into areas like derivatives trading and clearing in Europe, Howson said. Cboe is buying a pan-European stocks clearing house headquartered in the Netherlands.  POLITICAL HURDLES  Britain and the EU aim to complete assessments on so-called equivalence-based market access for firms like trading platforms and clearing houses by June.  Steven Maijoor, chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), said last week that assessments can be done by the summer, but a decision on access would hinge on wider trade negotiations between Brussels and London.  ESMA had said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, EU investors would have to use EU-based platforms for trading euro denominated shares and derivatives.  There are also other potential hurdles to UK access.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he does not want Britain to align itself to EU rules after Brexit, which could make access for financial firms hard to maintain.  The EU is also keen to build up its own capital market to cut reliance on London and could insist that EU investors trade euro-denominated shares on platforms inside the bloc.  Faced with pressure from EU policymakers, CME and the LSE moved trading in euro-denominated fixed income from London, while UK-based derivatives platforms are also waiting to see how much access they will get to the EU after transition.  \u201cWe would like to see a great deal more clarity in the area of... derivatives trading obligation,\u201d said Roger Cogan, head of European public policy at global derivatives industry body ISDA.  If trading moves, clearing could follow over time, industry officials say, further harming London. So far this has not been the case in swaps, where the LSE dominates clearing for now, although it has shifted clearing in euro repurchase agreements from London to its Paris arm.","113":"LONDON (Reuters) - Shorter hours would not be in the best interests of investors or stock markets, European bourses said on Wednesday, dashing hopes at banks and investment companies in London of cutting 90 minutes from the trading day.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) said shorter hours would be a move in the wrong direction. The current European trading day is 0900-1730 continental European time, longer than in Asia or Wall Street.  This means that share trading spans the Asian market close and the open on Wall Street, and a shorter day could put Europe at a competitive disadvantage to rival trading venues in other parts of the world, FESE said.  The London Stock Exchange LSE.L, which is not a member of FESE, held a public consultation earlier this year that found broad backing for cutting the trading day by 90 minutes to improve mental wellbeing and help attract more women on to trading floors.  But without a harmonised approach across Europe, the goals of shorter hours would be harder to achieve given banks have pan-European trading desks, the LSE has said.  The LSE declined to comment on FESE\u2019s statement.  London will also be wary of putting itself at any competitive disadvantage to rival exchanges in continental Europe now that Britain has left the European Union.  FESE said the length of the trading day did not have a negative impact on the working culture of trading and that a better work-life balance could be achieved if companies adopted other measures such as adding more shifts.  U.S. exchange Nasdaq, which operates the Stockholm bourse, said shortening hours would be \u201cmisguided\u201d, and that any change would need to be a pan-European decision that also included off-exchange trading platforms.  Britain\u2019s Investment Association and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, a banking lobby, reiterated their calls on Tuesday for a cut in trading hours.  Pan-European Exchange Euronext has just completed its own public consultation on market hours. Euronext, which is a vice-president of FESE, has already expressed scepticism about what it has called a \u201cLondon proposal.\u201d","114":"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. asset manager WisdomTree launched on Tuesday its first investment product that tracks bitcoin, a rare example of a mainstream money manager offering exposure to the volatile world of digital currencies.  FILE PHOTO: People walk past a board with the logo of Bitcoin in a street in Yerevan, Armenia September 9, 2019. REUTERS\/Anton Vaganov\/File Photo  WisdomTree, which specializes in exchange-traded funds, said in a statement the bitcoin exchange product (ETP) will offer large investors exposure to bitcoin without the need to directly hold the asset.  The ETP is the first of its kind by a mainstream, established asset manager, said Jason Guthrie, WisdomTree Europe\u2019s head of capital markets. WisdomTree oversees assets worth over $60 billion.  Cryptocurrency markets remain opaque and largely unregulated, suffering from frequent hacks and heists, with big money managers from pension funds tending to steer clear as a result.  Virtual currencies, including bitcoin, can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity without the need for a central authority such as a bank or a government. Until now, though, bitcoin has seen little practical use, and is instead mostly used as a speculative asset.  The ETP, which will trade on Switzerland\u2019s main stock exchange, will offer more liquid and transparent bitcoin trading, WisdomTree said. Its format will circumvent the need for investors to store the private access keys needed to safely hold cryptocurrencies, it added.  The product\u2019s underlying bitcoin will be held in \u201ccold,\u201d or offline, storage by Swissquote bank, Guthrie said.  It is unclear whether WisdomTree\u2019s move will tempt major investors to dabble in cryptocurrencies.  Other large financial firms already offer crypto products and services, including futures from the New York Stock Exchange owner the Intercontinental Exchange Inc and CME Group Inc.  WisdomTree\u2019s Guthrie said the product would be popular with long-term investors who may find futures difficult to trade and manage.  \u201cThere is a demand for things in an exchange-traded format,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cThere are plenty of clients that either can\u2019t trade futures, or find a physically-backed exchange traded product to be operationally more efficient.\u201d","115":"SINGAPORE, March 20 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat prices rose on Tuesday, clawing back some ground from their biggest three-day decline since 2013 after rains brought relief to the parched U.S. winter wheat crop in the southern Plains. Corn ticked higher to end a four-session losing streak, while soybeans edged up following deep losses on Monday. FUNDAMENTALS * The Chicago Board of Trade most-active wheat contract had risen 0.9 percent to $4.54-3\/4 a bushel by 0058 GMT. The market has given up 7.8 percent in the last three sessions, the biggest 3-day decline since April, 2013. * Corn was up 0.1 percent at $3.75-1\/2 a bushel, having dropped 2 percent on Monday. Soybeans gained 0.2 percent to $10.25 a bushel, having fallen 2.6 percent in the last session. * A winter storm brought beneficial rain and snow on Monday to portions of the southern U.S. Plains, where the region's hard red winter wheat crop has endured months of drought, an agricultural meteorologist said. * The storm produced about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of liquid moisture across northern, central and eastern Kansas, the biggest U.S. wheat-growing state. It also hit Nebraska and northern Colorado. * The region's hard red winter wheat is starting to emerge from dormancy and resume spring growth, a phase that ratchets up its need for moisture. * After the market closed on Monday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture rated 11 percent of the winter wheat in top state Kansas in good-to-excellent condition, down from 12 percent a week earlier. Wheat ratings also declined in Texas. * Most of Ukraine's winter grain crops were in a good or satisfactory condition as of March 18, analyst UkrAgroConsult said on Monday. * For corn, some analysts cited pressure from rains in crop areas of Argentina. * Wheat from Australia was offered at the lowest price of $306 a tonne (c&f) in Iraq's tender to purchase a minimum 50,000 tonnes of hard milling wheat which closed on Monday. * Active trading in CME Group's new cash-settled futures for Black Sea grain suggests the exchange may have found a way to tap into booming Black Sea export trade after an unsuccessful earlier foray in the region. MARKET NEWS * Oil prices slipped on Monday as Wall Street slid more than 1 percent and energy market investors remained wary of growing crude supply, although tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran gave prices some support. * Asian shares fell on Tuesday as investors dumped high-flying U.S. technology stocks on fears of stiffer regulation as Facebook came under fire following reports it allowed improper access to user data.

Earlier on Tuesday, Reuters reported the London Bullion Market Association and several major banks that trade gold had asked CME Group to allow gold bars in London to be used to settle its contracts to ease disruption to trading.  London is a key gold storage centre that uses 400-ounce bars which must be melted down and recast as 100-ounce bars to be accepted by Comex in New York.  The options for the new contract sizes include gold bars of 100 ounces, 400 ounces and 1 kg, CME said.  It will be available for trading on CME Globex, and will be subject to the rules and regulations of Comex in New York, the company added.  Traders feared shutdowns of air travel and precious metal refineries due to the pandemic will make it harder to ship bullion from London to the United States to meet contractual requirements.  \u201cBy offering a choice of delivery sizes as well as inter-commodity spreads with our benchmark gold futures, this new contract will provide customers with maximum flexibility in managing physical delivery,\u201d said Derek Sammann, CME\u2019s global head of commodity and options products.","117":"March 29 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories on the business pages of British newspapers.

Men enter the CME Group offices in New York, U.S., October 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  A union of the two firms would enable investors to access cash and futures trading and over-the-counter services via one provider for the first time, improving access to markets, NEX\u2019s founder and Chief Executive Michael Spencer said in a statement.  Spencer is a high-profile figure in London\u2019s financial industry and previously served as treasurer for Britain\u2019s ruling Conservative party. He will join CME\u2019s board and become a special adviser to the company after the deal goes ahead, CME said.  \u201cCME\u2019s decision to choose London as its European headquarters is also a signal of tremendous support for Britain\u2019s financial services sector,\u201d Spencer said.  The combined headquarters will be in Chicago.  Spencer, who holds a 17.62 percent stake in NEX according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data, stands to make about 670 million pounds from the deal.  CME Chairman and CEO Terry Duffy said the new entity would help investors lower trading expenses and better manage risk.  Shareholders in NEX, which matches buyers and sellers of bonds, swaps and currencies, will receive 500 pence in cash for each NEX share and 0.0444 new CME shares. Each NEX share would be valued at 1,000 pence, CME said.  The offer by CME, one of the world\u2019s biggest exchange groups and owner of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, represents a 2.9 percent premium to Wednesday\u2019s share price close of 972 pence.  Analysts said CME may have been prompted to bid now to avoid losing out to a rival, as global exchanges face rising competition for business amid shrinking trade volumes.  \u201cThis is a good price,\u201d Liberum analyst Justin Bates said, but added that the 50 percent cash component might disappoint some investors leaving \u201cthe door ajar for a competing offer with a higher cash component.\u201d  He said potential bidders could include ICE, Deutsche Boerse and London Stock Exchange (LSE) (LSE), with ICE the most likely frontrunner.  Nick O\u2019Donnell, M&A partner at law firm Baker McKenzie, said that as the bid had a large paper component, competing offers from rivals using cash, usually preferred by shareholders, could emerge.  NEX was trading below the offer price at 972 pence at 1217 GMT on Thursday. It has risen more than 30 percent in 2017.  EXCHANGE CONSOLIDATION  NEX, known as ICAP before the sale of its voice-broking business to TP ICAP in 2016, provides foreign exchange and fixed income trading technology via its EBS and BrokerTec platforms.  EBS, a foreign exchange matching platform, allows banks and other major institutions to trade the euro, yen and Swiss franc against the dollar, connecting buyers and sellers of currencies in more than 50 countries.  BrokerTec is the market leader for electronic trading in many U.S and European fixed income products, including U.S. Treasuries, European Government Bonds and European Repo.  \u201cIt\u2019s a company that has always been ripe for acquisition,\u201d Matthew Page, fund manager at Guinness Asset Management and one of NEX\u2019s 25 largest investors, told Reuters, adding CME probably thought \u201cthey\u2019ve got to make a move for it now or it might get snapped up by someone else.\u201d  CME said the deal would expand its presence in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific. It expects the acquisition to generate run rate cost savings of $200 million by the end of 2021.  The deal will add to its cash adjusted earnings per share from 2019, with a one-time cash cost of $285 million, CME said.  The takeover could spook regulators concerned about the potential dominance of a new entity in some markets, especially U.S. government debt, where CME is already in the top position.  Previous big exchange mergers, such LSE and Deutsche Boerse, have hit antitrust buffers.  But the collapse of the LSE-Deutsche Boerse deal did not stem the appetite for exchange deals.  Pan-European exchange Euronext bought the Irish Stock Exchange for 137 million euros ($168.88 million) last year.  The deal to buy NEX is CME's largest since the financial crisis. It bought NYMEX in 2008 for $11 billion. reut.rs\/2GTwIOA  \u201cCME do not seem to be planning any divestments, which may disappoint the European exchanges,\u201d a research note by Exane BNP Paribas said.  A marriage of CME\u2019s clearing house and NEX\u2019s TriOptima compression service will allow CME to compete against the dominance of LCH in the OTC clearing market, the note said.  LCH, part of the LSE, dominates clearing in euro-denominated instruments such as debt repurchase agreements and interest rate swaps.  \u201cWhatever happens, whether there is a competing bid for (NEX) or not, you will see continued consolidation in the exchange space,\u201d Liberum analyst Bates said.

FILE PHOTO: The London Stock Exchange Group offices are seen in the City of London, Britain, December 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo  This \"time-limited\" access will avoid severe disruption to over-the-counter or OTC derivatives worth trillions of euros that are cleared at LCH LSE.L in London.  WHY TIME-LIMITED?  It increases leverage for the EU, which wants a deeper capital market that relies less on the City of London.  The bulk of clearing in privately traded or OTC euro-denominated interest rate swaps for EU investors is done in London and there is little sign of this changing substantially anytime soon. Time-limited access allows clearers inside the EU to build up their capacity to take over from London. A deadline would put pressure on banks to move positions from London to the euro zone.  HOW MUCH EURO CLEARING HAS MOVED SO FAR?  LCH LSE.L says nothing discernible. Deutsche Boerse's DB1Gn.DE Eurex, the only EU-based clearer of euro swaps of note, said it has around 19 trillion euros of outstanding notional value in rate swaps and forward rate agreements. Eurex has 7.3 trillion euros purely in swaps compared to LCH's 45.8 trillion euros. Eurex has an overall target of 25 trillion euros or a quarter of the market by the end of this year.  WHAT\u2019S INVOLVED IN A MOVE FROM LONDON?  Banks would have to close out or sell their swaps positions worth billions of euros in London and open new positions in Eurex. It is a costly and complex transaction that can take several hours or longer and leave the seller in a potentially vulnerable situation. There is no mechanism for shifting such huge positions in a short time.  CAN THE EU GET ALL OF THE EURO MARKET?  No, because only a portion is transacted between EU based counterparties, the sub-sector the bloc\u2019s regulators can realistically target. LCH is likely to remain the clearer for euro swaps traded between non-EU counterparties.  WILL LONDON GET ACCESS FOR THE LONGER TERM?  Most likely. It would be hard for the EU to shut off LCH completely given that it already allows clearers in the United States like CME and ICE to serve EU customers. In return for access, Britain has to allow the EU to jointly supervise LCH until it no longer clears a \u201csystemic\u201d amount of euro trades, a politically sensitive requirement. Otherwise Brussels could force EU investors to use an EU or another non-British clearer it approves of.","120":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's NEX Group Plc NXGN.L said it had received a preliminary takeover approach from U.S.-based exchange operator CME Group CME.O, in a move to create a cross-border trading powerhouse.  A man enters the CME Group offices in New York, U.S., October 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Talks with CME Group - one of the world\u2019s biggest exchange groups that owns the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange - are at an early stage, NEX Group said in a statement on Thursday.  The talks were first reported by Bloomberg.  NEX, a financial technology company that matches buyers and sellers of bonds, swaps and currencies, said there was no certainty that an offer would be made.  Scooping up NEX would mark another attempt by a foreign exchange operator to buy into a British business to straddle on and off exchange products, cash and futures markets, and clearing.  Known as ICAP until the sale of its voice broking business to TP ICAP TCAP.L in 2016, NEX was founded by Michael Spencer, its chief executive and a high-profile figure in London's financial industry.  Its shares have surged more than 40 percent over the last two years as market volatility in the wake of political surprises, such as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s victory and Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, fueled trading on its platforms.  COULD HIT LSE\u2019S CLEARING UNIT  Attempts at blockbuster exchange mergers, such as between the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Deutsche Boerse, have hit antitrust buffers in recent years, and buying NEX could be easier for regulators and politicians to accept.  Patrick Young, an adviser to exchanges, said CME could be looking to clear NEX products to boost in-house business, a step that would hit rival clearing houses like the LSE's LSE.L LCH unit.  \u201cWill this open a bidding war?

China\u2019s major commodity exchanges have been rushing to launch futures contracts on a range of products - from dates to electricity - in recent years as they move to tap investor risk appetite and offer the country\u2019s vast industrial sector ways to protect revenue.  On Friday, the ShFE will launch copper options and is considering opening its flagship copper futures to foreign investors, a major step in the nation\u2019s effort to develop its derivatives industry.  The ShFE already offers aluminium futures and China is the world\u2019s top producer and consumer of the metal used in cars and aeroplanes.  A Chinese alumina contract would compete with the product run by U.S. rival CME Group, allowing alumina refiners and aluminium smelters to better protect their exposure to fluctuating prices.  \u201cMy colleagues are working on it because alumina (prices) have witnessed some fluctuations over the past couple of years, so we had some calls from the market to launch the new futures,\u201d Zhang said.  Alumina prices on a free-on-board basis from Australia have risen by almost 50 percent so far this year amid an outage at Norsk Hydro\u2019s Alunorte refinery in Brazil, U.S. sanctions on Russia\u2019s Rusal and a strike at Alcoa\u2019s operations in Western Australia.  In China, alumina prices have soared as Beijing\u2019s crackdown on heavy industry has shuttered some refiners, tightening supplies.  Zhang said the ShFE first started to pay attention to alumina futures in 2013 and this year began testing alumina storage.  He said it can take a \u201clong time\u201d to launch a contract in China.  The bourse is also looking at aluminium alloy futures, but it will not be in the short term, while stainless steel futures could be rolled out in the next one to two years, he said.

The losses by HSBC, one of the world\u2019s biggest bullion trading banks, are theoretical, reflecting the value of positions it held. They do not necessarily mean it lost money.  HSBC said in the filing that the issue was mainly due to an \u201cunprecedented widening of the gold exchange-for-physical basis, reflecting Covid-19-related challenges in gold refining and transportation, which affected HSBC\u2019s gold leasing and financing business and other gold hedging activity\u201d.  It declined to comment further.  The exchange-for-physical, or EFP, is the difference between the price of U.S. gold futures and spot gold in the London market.  Usually, the two trade within a few dollars of one another, but coronavirus containment measures in March closed several precious metals refineries and grounded many planes, creating fears that it would be impossible to move gold to New York to meet contract obligations.  This pushed the premium for gold futures on CME Group\u2019s Comex exchange to as much as $70 an ounce - or 4% - higher than London spot gold on March 24.  That gap has since narrowed sharply as refineries have reopened.  HSBC said in the filing that reductions in foreign exchange and equities volatility and a tightening of credit spreads had also contributed to the $200 million mark-to-market loss.

The monthly auction process will allow customers who purchase an ICE Permian WTI crude futures contract, deliverable at Magellan\u2019s East Houston terminal (MEH), the option to load crude directly onto a vessel at Galena Park and Seabrook dock facilities for export, the companies said.  The capacity offered will be adequate to fill Panamax and Aframax size vessels, with Suezmax size vessels set to be added in the future.  Earlier this year, rival exchange operator CME Group and midstream company Enterprise Products Partners LP teamed up to conduct electronic auctions for crude exports.  CME launched its WTI Houston crude futures contract, deliverable at Enterprise\u2019s Houston system, in November, just after the ICE Permian WTI crude futures contract launched in October.  The race to provide dock space and export capabilities along with Gulf Coast futures comes as U.S. crude exports have surged to a monthly record above 3 million barrels per day (bpd) after the United States lifted a ban in late 2015.  A shale boom has helped make the Unites States the biggest oil producer in the world, ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia, and putting it on track to consistently being a net exporter of crude and refined fuels.  \u201cWe believe this new program will offer our customers the ability to seamlessly enhance their crude oil export capabilities at Houston area facilities,\u201d Robb Barnes, Magellan\u2019s senior vice president of commercial crude oil said in a statement.

European stock trading volumes swelled on Monday to more than three times their 90-day daily average, according to Refinitiv data, as share prices suffered their biggest one-day drop since the 2008 financial crisis and oil prices plunged 25%.  Ten days into March, European share trading volumes have already hit more than half their February total, Refinitiv data shows.  The resurgence will be welcomed by traders. London-based inter-dealer broker TP ICAP, for instance, has seen record-breaking volumes during the past fortnight\u2019s selloff, CEO Nicolas Breteau told Reuters on Tuesday.  \u201cWe had reached record volumes, with clients hedging, rebalancing their portfolios ... a lot of intense activity,\u201d Breteau said, adding that while the environment affected clients, the volatility offered TP ICAP an opportunity that \u201cgives us confidence for the future.\u201d  Before March, trading desks at banks and elsewhere had suffered a prolonged period of low volatility and lacklustre volumes, crimping profitability.  Typically, more volatile markets encourage traders to buy and sell more often, handing more revenue to market makers that charge a spread on each transaction.  Volumes are now rebounding across asset classes.  Turnover of currency futures topped $200 billion on Monday, more than double the daily average reported year-to-date, data provided to Reuters by CME showed. That included more than $70 billion of trading in euro\/dollar and $49 billion in dollar\/yen.  EBS, which runs one of the world\u2019s biggest FX platforms, declined to give data for Monday but told Reuters that volumes for last week had run 80% above 2019 averages.  Volumes in G10 currencies were nearly double their 2019 daily average, EBS said.  Refinitiv, another big forex market player, said Monday had been its busiest day for spot currency trading since the U.S. Presidential Election in November 2016.  The company declined to give the dollar value for Monday\u2019s volumes but said activity on its FX Matching platform was more than double the daily average traded during February.  Markets are now the most volatile since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.  Wall Street\u2019s so-called fear gauge has reached its most elevated since 2008, U.S. Treasury market volatility the highest since 2009, and price swings in the FX market are at three-year highs.  BOND TRADING  Bond trading platforms are also reporting increased activity as clients dump riskier bonds and pile into the safety of government debt such as U.S. Treasuries, where yields have collapsed to record lows.  However, the rise in volumes last week was not dramatic and Monday actually saw reduced activity, suggesting many investors had stuck to the sidelines.  MarketAxess, which runs a major fixed-income platform, said trading of government and corporate bonds by European clients totalled 136.8 billion euros ($155.5 billion) on Monday. That compared with a daily average of 190 billion euros last week.  Daily volumes in 2020 have ranged from as low as 78 billion euros to as high as 228 billion euros, MarketAxess data showed.  Tradeweb, another company running a large bond trading platform, declined to give specific numbers.  \u201cWhile we don\u2019t report our trading activity on a daily basis, we continue to experience strong volumes across our platforms in line with broader market volatility,\u201d Tradeweb said.  There is some evidence that the jump in volatility may also be undermining liquidity - the ease with which buyers and sellers can transact without moving the price.  Prior to Monday, traders say frenzied trading activity had generally been orderly.  \u201cIn the morning, we tried to trim a position in the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond and were shocked when several dealers were reluctant to show us a firm price, something we can\u2019t remember ever happening before,\u201d TwentyFour Asset Management said in a daily note, referring to Monday.  \u201cNormal service resumed shortly afterward, but to us this was a stark illustration of the sheer panic that permeated the market.\u201d ($1 = 0.8797 euros)","127":"(Reuters) - London Stock Exchange Group LSE.L reported higher quarterly income as its clearing, capital markets and FTSE Russell businesses grew strongly, helping ease lingering investor concern after a difficult 2017 for the company.

The move shows growing demand for hedging tools in the quickly developing and increasingly volatile LNG market, with the introduction of freight derivatives having lagged behind the development of financial tools to hedge gas volumes.  \u201cThe biggest unhedged risk (on the LNG market) is on the freight side,\u201d Owain Johnson, CME Group global head of product development and research, told Reuters.  \u201cWe have had a lot of demand from brokers and traders and are launching the LNG freight contracts as soon as possible.\u201d  LNG Freight futures will be available to trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).  So far, multi-month charters of physical vessels have been the major tool to hedge price fluctuations on the LNG shipping market.  Strong volatility in shipping rates last year, when charter rates for LNG tankers doubled between August and October, increased the need for financial products to mitigate price risks.  The contracts offered by CME Group are based on the assessment of three LNG shipping routes that the London-based Baltic Exchange started publishing earlier this year.  The Baltic Exchange collects data from shipping brokers to provide assessment of routes from Australia\u2019s Gladstone to Tokyo, U.S. Sabine Pass to Britain, Sabine Pass to Tokyo.

Lawyers said it would be tough to prove a business caused a customer\u2019s illness, but concerns are so intense that a waiver may soon become the new normal.  Entities including the YMCA of Greater Oklahoma City, a real estate agency in Arizona, a racecar speedway in Seinsgrove, Pennsylvania, and the New York Stock Exchange have introduced waivers disavowing responsibility for anyone who might contract the disease onsite, Reuters has learned.  Missoula, Montana-based lawyer Paige Marie Griffith created a waiver for COVID-19, the respiratory illness related to the novel coronavirus, that business owners can buy and customize online. Events industry workers, including makeup artists and wedding photographers, are using them, she said.  \u201cAs essential as we feel, everyone getting their hair done is choosing to do so,\u201d said Cody Brooke, who owns 10th Avenue Hair Designs in Pensacola, Florida. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the salon or stylist to be held liable knowing that they chose to come in.\u201d  Since reopening on May 11, the salon requires clients to sign a form stating they have no COVID-19 symptoms and have not visited a \u201chot spot\u201d with high infection rates in the last 30 days. It releases the salon from liability for \u201cunintentional exposure\u201d to the virus.  Ryan Reiffert did not mind signing a waiver recently for the gym where he practices martial arts near San Antonio, Texas. He had symptoms in March and later learned from antibody testing that had likely contracted the virus.  \u201cBut even if I hadn\u2019t had it,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d happily sign the waiver.\u201d  A gym attendant sprayed disinfectant on Reiffer\u2019s hands and feet before he could enter, he said.

U.S. crude futures for May delivery plunged below zero on Monday, with desperate traders at one point paying customers some $40 a barrel to take oil so they would not have to accept delivery on an expiring futures contract. The coronavirus pandemic has slashed fuel demand worldwide, and storage space for the unused oil is rapidly filling, especially in the United States. [L1N2C80CS]  The unprecedented activity stunned global energy traders and prompted calls from some for further government support of the beleaguered U.S. industry.  \u201cThe sanctity and trust in the oil and all commodity futures markets are at issue as the system failed miserably and an immediate investigation is requested and, we submit, is required,\u201d Hamm said in the letter in which he detailed the unusual activity.  Continental has also filed a complaint with CME, Hamm said in the letter.  CME, which operates the U.S. crude oil futures benchmark, called Hamm\u2019s allegations \u201cfactually inaccurate\u201d and said \u201cprices reflect fundamentals in the physical crude oil market driven by the unprecedented global impacts of the coronavirus, including decreased demand for crude, global oversupply, and high levels of U.S. storage utilization.\u201d  A CFTC spokesman declined to comment on any investigation, but told Reuters: \u201cWe continue to look at these developments closely.\u201d  The agency\u2019s chairman Heath Tarbert on Tuesday said the volatility in oil prices is due to fundamental supply and demand issues, not a financial markets issue.  Continental Resources, which Hamm founded in 1967, is highly exposed to the oil market rout because the North Dakota shale producer had not hedged its production heading into this year\u2019s historic rout, Reuters reported last month.  Prior to Monday's unprecedented trading, crude oil CLc1 prices had already plunged more than 70% this year, hit by a surprise price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia as well as the slowdown in demand due to the coronavirus outbreak.  The letter, which was first reported by The Oklahoman, is believed to be the first request to the CFTC to probe Monday\u2019s trade.  Hamm, who last year stepped down as Continental\u2019s Chief Executive, was an informal campaign advisor to Trump in 2016 and was once considered by Trump as a candidate for U.S. Energy Secretary.","132":"(Reuters) - The United States Oil Fund LP, the largest oil-focused exchange-traded product in the country, cut its exposure to July crude futures contracts and increased its exposure to September contracts, according to a filing on Friday.  The move comes after exchange operator CME Group issued letters that imposed limits on positions acquired in the contracts held by USO, the filing said. (bit.ly\/2xNGkKV)  USO said it may invest about 40% of its portfolio in crude oil futures contracts on the NYMEX and ICE platforms for July and 20% in September contracts, compared to 50% and 10%, respectively, it had earlier said it would invest.  The fund, which previously invested mainly in front-month contracts, is looking to cushion the blow from a historic sell-off in oil markets hit by oversupply and a coronavirus-induced plunge in fuel demand.  By diversifying its holdings to a wider range of contracts, the fund could potentially allay pressure on its shares. Later-dated oil contracts are trading at higher prices than nearer-term ones.  Demand for the fund has surged as retail investors piled into oil, looking to profit from a rebound after an unprecedented sell-off sent prices near negative $40 on Monday.  USO, which ended 2.65% lower at $2.57 on Friday, is not alone in reducing their clients\u2019 exposure to front-month oil futures contracts.  Several brokerages, including discount giant TD Ameritrade Corp, are limiting new positions being taken up in certain crude oil contracts after the high-volatility trading on Monday delivered big losses.

FILE PHOTO: Ingots of 99.99 percent pure silver are seen at the Krastsvetmet non-ferrous metals plant, one of the world's largest producers in the precious metals industry, in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, Russia November 22, 2018. REUTERS\/Ilya Naymushin\/File Photo  The move into silver came after the Reddit message board r\/WallStreetBets marshalled a surge of buying of companies including GameStop, forcing their shares up by hundreds of percent.  Silver has moved less dramatically - rising around 20% before falling back - in part because it is a larger and more complex market.  So how does silver trade?  OVER THE COUNTER  The biggest marketplace for physical silver (and gold) is London, where banks and brokers handle buy and sell orders from clients across the world.  Trading is done bilaterally over the counter (OTC) between financial institutions, and an investor must have a relationship with one of these to access the market.  The market is underpinned by bars of bullion which sit in the vaults of large banks such as JPMorgan and HSBC.  Around 660 million ounces of silver worth some $18 billion traded on average each day in the London market last week, according to the London Bullion Market Association.  FUTURES  Silver also trades on futures exchanges. The largest are the Shanghai Futures Exchange in China and CME Group\u2019s. Comex in New York, each of which host trading of around half a billion ounces of silver a day.  Futures are contracts in which the seller pledges to deliver silver to the buyer on a later date. They are typically traded through a broker.  Most futures are not held until delivery but swapped for later-dated ones. This allows both buyer and seller to speculate on the silver price without the trouble of moving and storing metal.  Another advantage of futures is that the holder need not pay the full amount for silver, but instead pays a fraction of its value, known as a margin.  EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS (ETFs)  ETFs trade on stock exchanges such as the NYSE and LSE alongside shares in publicly traded companies.  They store silver for their investors, with each share in the fund representing an amount of silver stored in a vault.  Small investors can trade shares in ETFs easily via apps such as Robinhood.  If demand for the ETF is strong enough to push the price above that of the underlying metal, more silver is moved into the vault to allow new shares to be created, moving the prices back into line.  The largest is the iShares Silver Trust, run by investment manager Blackrock, which contains around 620 million ounces of silver worth some $17 billion at current prices.  BARS AND COINS  Smaller investors can also buy silver bars and coins from retailers around the world.  Investors buy roughly 200 million ounces of silver bars and coins each year, accounting for about one fifth of total annual supply of silver, according to analysts Refinitiv Metals.  SILVER MINERS  Investors can also buy shares in companies that mine silver. Like ETFs, these are easy to trade on platforms like Robinhood.

Data released on Wednesday from CME Group Inc showed open interest in its benchmark Treasury and interest rate futures contracts plunged by more than 400,000 contracts on Tuesday, signaling a frantic dash to close out wrong-footed positions.  Outstanding positions in 2-year Treasury note futures alone dropped by more than 266,000 contracts, meaning traders closed out more than 11 percent of all open interest in a single day. For 10-year futures, open interest fell by around 137,000 as trading volume in the benchmark contract hit a record.  \u201cSome people were short coming in and then they flipped,\u201d Greg Adamsick, director of global futures and options at RCM Alternatives in Chicago, said on Wednesday.  Last week, hedge funds\u2019 net short positions in 10-year Treasury notes fell to the lowest level in nearly two months, while bond dealers raised net shorts in 10-year T-notes to the highest since February 2016.  \u201cOne would have to think a lot of short positions, especially weak ones, had to capitulate,\u201d said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed income at D.A. Davidson in Seattle.  Less than two weeks ago, the 10-year Treasury yield broke above 3.10 percent to its highest levels in nearly seven years on expectations of rising inflation and federal borrowing.  But since then, bond yields have begun retreating on worries about the renewed trade tension between China and the United States; cancellation of a nuclear summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and Turkey\u2019s economic policies under President Tayyip Erdogan.  Some analysts also reckoned Treasuries were simply oversold.  Although bond bears regained some footing as the market gave back some of Tuesday\u2019s dramatic gains, yields remained well below their seven-year high.  On Wednesday, the 10-year yield rose to 2.855 percent as Italian politicians scrambled for a deal to form a government, reducing some safe-haven bond holdings from the day before. The 10-year yield had fallen to 2.759 percent on Tuesday, which was the lowest since April 11, according to Reuters data.  The boon for U.S. Treasury securities on Tuesday resulted in a 0.952 percent total return on the day, the biggest one-day gain since July 29, 2011, according to an index compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays.  The reversal in market sentiment was captured by a closely followed survey from J.P. Morgan.  It showed that the share of J.P. Morgan\u2019s Treasury customers who are holding fewer longer-dated government issues than their benchmarks was equal to the share of customers who are holding more longer-dated bonds than their benchmarks on Tuesday.  This was the least bearish their clients were on Treasuries since April 2017.  In the short-term term, bearish bond bets remain vulnerable to political developments in Europe as Italy seeks to form a government and a possible no-confidence vote of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Friday.  \u201cI hardly think we are out of the woods,\u201d D.A. Davidson\u2019s Hurley said.","137":"(Adds gold, oil settlement prices)  * MSCI world shares index up 1.53%  * GameStop shares plunge, silver prices tumble  * U.S. stimulus package brightens in Congress  NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Global stock markets surged for a second day on Tuesday, spurred by increased optimism about more U.S. stimulus and the economic recovery, while retail investors retreated from GameStop and fleeting interest in silver, causing their prices to tumble.  The party for the Reddit-inspired trading frenzy mob that pushed GameStop\u2019s stock up five-fold in five days last week appeared over as its shares plunged 55.95% to $99.11 in still heavy trade.  GameStop closed on Friday at $325 a share after hitting $483 earlier in the session.  Silver prices also fell on Tuesday, sliding -7.61% to $26.77, after exchange operator CME Group Inc raised maintenance margins on its COMEX 5000 Silver Futures contract by 17.9% to their highest since October 2020.  CME\u2019s move on silver took the air out of GameStop too, with short interest declining to 53% of the stock\u2019s available shares to trade, from 140%, said Tom Hayes, founder and chairman of hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.  \u201cEveryone\u2019s rushing for the same narrow exit and trying to get off margin, and you have a lot of weak sisters that are coming out of the stock,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThe squeeze is over.\u201d  Equity markets rallied as investors saw improved prospects for President Joe Biden\u2019s proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package after he met with 10 Senate Republicans to discuss their scaled-back $618 billion plan.

MSCI\u2019s world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 1.53% after posting its strongest day in three months on Monday.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan rose 1.4%. China\u2019s benchmark CSI300 Index gained 1.5%, helped by easing concerns about tight liquidity and declining cases of new coronavirus infections. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 added 1%.  The dollar rose to two-month highs against the euro on a perceived widening disparity between the strength of U.S. and European economic recoveries from the coronavirus pandemic.  A sell-off in the euro after coronavirus lockdowns choked consumer spending in Germany and short-covering in over-crowded dollar-selling positions also strengthened the greenback.  The euro was last down 0.34% at $1.2018. The Japanese yen weakened 0.14% at 105.08 per dollar.  The Australian dollar pared gains after the country\u2019s central bank said it would extend its quantitative easing program to buy an additional $100 billion of bonds. The Aussie last stood at $0.7602, off the day\u2019s high of $0.7662.  With global market sentiment remaining upbeat about U.S. fiscal stimulus, core euro zone government bond yields edged up, with the benchmark German 10-year Bund yield < DE10YT=RR.> around two basis points higher at -0.492%.  The 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 0.3 basis points to 1.1065%.  U.S. gold futures shed 1.6% to $1,834.90.

U.S. crude futures settled up $1.21 at $54.76 a barrel.","138":"April 3 (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve on Tuesday will begin to publish the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), a rate that regulators hope will eventually be adopted to back U.S. dollar-based derivatives and loans. The aim is that the new rate will eventually reduce markets\u2019 dependence on Libor.  Following are some facts about the rate.  What is SOFR?  SOFR is based on transactions in the Treasury repurchase market, where banks and investors borrow or loan Treasuries overnight. A group of large banks, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC), selected the rate as an alternative to the London interbank offered rate (Libor) in derivatives. It cited the depth and robustness of the market where around $800 billion is traded daily.  Why do we need a new rate?  Regulators including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are seeking to reduce markets\u2019 reliance on Libor due to a decline in loans backing the rate. If the rate stops being published \u201cthat has all the potential of being a pretty significant financial stability problem,\u201d Powell said in February.  The ARRC, which selected SOFR as an alternative rate, said in March that Libor underpins $200 trillion in derivatives and loans, more than previously thought, underscoring the necessity of promoting a robust alternative. Derivatives account for 95 percent of the exposures.  Why was there a decline in usage of Libor?  Reforms to banking and money market fund regulations resulted in fewer interbank short-term loans and reduced demand for the bank debt. Also, Libor\u2019s reputation was damaged by charges that banks manipulated the rate before and during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, often to book larger profits on derivatives based on the rate. Libor rates are sometimes estimated rather than based on actual transactions.  Will it replace Libor?  SOFR is intended to work alongside Libor. Over time, regulators hope that more derivatives and loans will be backed by the rate, which will decrease the importance of Libor. The New York Fed\u2019s publication of the rate is the first in a series of steps to enable a transition. The CME Group will begin trading futures based on the rate on May 7. Major dealers and clearinghouses that guarantee interest rate swap trades are also working to enable swaps based on the new rate. The head of Britain\u2019s financial markets regulator said last year that a Libor substitute must be in place for banks to use by the end of 2021, and that Libor must be replaced because there are not enough transactions underpinning the rates.  Is this the first global effort to find an alternative?  No. Regulators have pushed internationally to find alternatives to Libor and its equivalents. A British committee last year selected SONIA, an unsecured overnight lending rate, as an alternative to sterling-based Libor and Japan selected TONAR as an alternative to yen Libor, also an unsecured rate. A group in Switzerland selected SARON, a collateralized rate based on the Swiss repo market.  The European Central Bank is developing a daily euro unsecured overnight index rate.","139":"May 14 (Reuters) - CME Group Inc:  * CME GROUP AND CRYPTO FACILITIES LAUNCH ETHER REFERENCE RATE AND ETHER REAL TIME INDEX Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","140":"FILE PHOTO: The offices where the London Metal Exchange is headquartered are seen in the City of London, Britain, January 18, 2018 REUTERS\/Peter Nicholls  LONDON (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME) will launch a new set of synthetic monthly prices to make it easier for investors and funds to invest in base metals as the LME battles competition from other exchanges such as those operated by CME Group Inc.

But after nearly four decades of trading, sometimes winning, sometimes losing, Anthony Ward threw in the towel.  FILE PHOTO: A man enters the CME Group offices in New York, United States, October 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Ward blames the rise of computer-driven funds and high-frequency trading for forcing him and some other well-known commodities investors to close their hedge funds and look for opportunities where machines can\u2019t make a difference.  While computerized trading is not new, Ward and others argue its steady rise has reached a tipping point that is distorting prices and creating uncertainty not only for investors, but for chocolate firms, carmakers and others who rely on commodities.  It was in January 2016, after a slide in cocoa prices, that Ward decided the days of traditional commodity investors doing well from taking positions based on fundamentals such as supply and demand may be numbered.  \u201cIt was just too big, too quick, too dramatic. And completely against the fundamentals,\u201d Ward told Reuters.  Commodity markets fell across the board that month after weak factory data in China raised fears of lower demand from the world\u2019s top consumer of raw materials.  Ward blamed the slide in cocoa on what he regarded as misplaced selling by computer-driven funds reacting to the Chinese data, given China has scant impact on the cocoa market.  \u201cThe actual fundamentals in cocoa were extraordinarily bullish in January 2016. We were forecasting the largest harmattan in history, which is exactly what happened,\u201d he said.  His prediction that a hot, harmattan wind from the Sahara desert would hit harvests in Ivory Coast and Ghana and drive cocoa prices higher did come to pass - but not before the fund had been forced to cut its losses when the market slumped.  At the end of 2017, Ward closed the CC+ hedge fund that had invested in cocoa and coffee markets for years.  And at the end of January, commodity hedge fund Jamison Capital Partners run by Stephen Jamison closed. He told investors that machine learning and artificial intelligence had eliminated short-term trading opportunities, while commodities did not offer obvious benefits in the long term.  Also in 2017, renowned oil trader Andrew Hall, who earned $100 million in 2008, called time on his main Astenbeck Commodities Fund II.  He had said in an earlier letter to investors that extreme volatility caused by \u201cnon-traditional investors and algorithmic trading\u201d made it difficult to hold onto long-term positions when the market moved against them.  In 2016, Michael Farmer, founding partner of the Red Kite fund that specializes in copper, also accused high-frequency traders using super-fast computers of distorting the market and getting an unfair advantage.  For a graphic on automated trading, click reut.rs\/2BiHAF8  DISTORTION?  Other investors have taken refuge in related sectors or left commodities altogether, exasperated by the automated trading that drives about half of U.S. commodity futures trading.  A study by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission last year showed computerized trading on the world\u2019s largest futures exchange, CME Group, accounted for 49 percent of the volume in agriculture contracts and 58 percent for some energy contracts.  At the same time, data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research shows the average hedge fund returned 8.64 percent in 2017 but commodity hedge funds eked out returns of just 0.43 percent.  Ward estimates that while in the past automated trading would distort the market by 10 percent to 15 percent from prices justified by fundamentals - which he said was irritating but often manageable - it can now reach 25 percent to 30 percent.  Algorithmic, or systematic, funds use computers to make decisions after processing vast amounts of data, or trade on signals such as market momentum or when prices hit key levels.  Those who run automated funds argue that they inject much-needed liquidity while capturing the dynamics of the market more efficiently than traditional trading strategies.  Farmer and others say, however, that it is unfair for exchanges to allow high-frequency trading (HFT) groups to have co-location platforms, allowing them to put super-computers in the same data center as the exchange servers.  They say that gives HFTs the tiny advantage they need to jump ahead of incoming orders, effectively piggybacking. Traditional investors say this exacerbates market moves and in turn makes it more costly for them to take out hedges when price moves go against them.  MIND-BOGGLING DATA  Systematic fund managers see the rise of their sector as a part of a trend that is transforming not only financial markets but wider society with the advent of artificial intelligence, robots and machine learning.  \u201cI don\u2019t feel too sorry (for traditional fund managers),\u201d said Anthony Lawler, co-head of GAM Systematic, the quantitative part of Swiss money manager GAM Holding, which had assets under management (AUM) of 148.4 billion Swiss francs ($158 billion) at the end of September.  \u201cInformation, which used to be expensive, difficult to get, not easily shared, is now ubiquitous. It\u2019s truly mind-boggling the depth of data available,\u201d Lawler said.  \u201cThat means it\u2019s much more difficult to have an information edge and advantage to the player who can digest and analyze the data the quickest.\u201d  GAM Systematic, which had $4.3 billion of assets at the end of September, regards commodities as one of many markets it monitors for opportunities by crunching data such as weather forecasts and shipping data that shows how full a vessel is.  He acknowledged that algorithms can lead to mistakes and over-generalization, but said that should just open up opportunities for traditional fund managers.  \u201cIf you\u2019re a great discretionary trader, then sit on the sidelines and wait for those missteps ... I would be super happy if that trader is successfully picking off some of these missteps,\u201d said Lawler.  Systematic funds also make decisions based on the structure and technical levels of markets. Some analysts argue that markets absorb fundamental information before many analysts are aware of it and automated funds are simply more efficient.  \u201cI used to do a lot of fundamental analysis when I was in equities and I realized it doesn\u2019t really matter, it was a waste of time,\u201d said Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at commodities broker Marex Spectron.  \u201cThe truth is fundamental analysis is effectively the work of a historian, seeking to provide explanation for what has already occurred,\u201d he said.  SCHIZOPHRENIC MARKETS  Some fund managers and analysts say computerized trading has been amplified in commodities because other participants such as banks and pension funds have cut exposure to the sector.  Total global commodity assets under management more than halved from 2012 to 2015 to under $200 billion, though the total has since recovered to just over $300 billion, according to Barclays.  \u201cThere\u2019s less liquidity, and therefore prices are more choppy, more schizophrenic, because of the exit of so many market counterparties,\u201d said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at French bank Societe Generale.  Not all those who have closed commodity hedge funds put the blame on computers.  \u201cEither you read the information badly, or you have bad information,\u201d said Christophe Cordonnier, who co-founded the Belaco Capital fund in 2012 after heading investor sales in commodities at Societe Generale.  Cordonnier says Belaco Capital made a bad decision on timing, launching the fund in 2012 and counting on a global economic recovery to boost commodities. After a rebound failed to materialize, the fund closed in 2015.  Other fund managers have survived by being creative, such as Christoph Eibl, chief executive of Tiberius Asset Management, whose commodity assets under management have dwindled from $2.5 billion at its peak to about $350 million.  \u201cSeven years ago we started diversifying our business operations,\u201d said Eibl. He now operates a merchant business in metals with a turnover of more than $1 billion a year, runs tungsten and tin mines in Africa and Asia and is soon to launch a metals-backed crypto-currency.  Ever the risk taker, Ward still plans to trade cocoa and coffee - but only with his own money - while looking for opportunities in the underlying physical commodities markets. And he\u2019s keeping a close eye on computerized trading.  \u201cIn the end the whole thing will blow up because when there\u2019s a big problem, a black swan event, they won\u2019t be able to get out. It will be very messy,\u201d said Ward.","143":"BRUSSELS\/ZURICH (Reuters) - The European Commission and Switzerland both refused to blink on Wednesday in a standoff over a stalled partnership treaty that threatens to trigger stock trading curbs across Europe from Monday.

REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo  Barring an improbable last-minute breakthrough, EU-based banks and brokers will be prevented from trading shares directly on Swiss bourses from July 1. They usually generate more than half the turnover on Swiss stock markets.  The Swiss have vowed to retaliate with a decree forcing all Swiss shares to be traded on domestic exchanges by banning EU bourses from hosting Swiss equities trading.  In Brussels, the Commission said it has had no contact with Switzerland in the past few days on avoiding the expiration at the end of this week of the regime which allows Swiss stock exchanges to access the European Union market.  \u201cThere have not been any contact,\u201d the EU executive\u2019s spokeswoman told a news conference. She said there was no update from last week\u2019s meeting of the EU Commission that refrained from proposing an extension to the so-called equivalence regime.  Under EU rules, the EU executive had to decide by June 21 on whether to propose an extension of the equivalence regime. It did not make any proposal by that deadline. As a consequence the preferential regime will automatically expire on June 30.  In Bern, a government spokesman said the cabinet had not discussed the Europe dossier at its weekly meeting.  \u201cIf (stock market regulation) equivalence is not given then Plan B will be activated -- protective measures for the Swiss exchanges -- and that will simply be activated at the end of this month,\u201d he told reporters after the meeting.  Brussels linked the extension to progress on a general partnership treaty, which was agreed in November after years of negotiations but has not yet been endorsed by Bern because of fears over its impact on Swiss labor laws and other issues.  Last week the commission said there was no progress on the partnership treaty. The spokeswoman repeated on Wednesday that the situation had not changed.  She added, however, that Brussels remained open to finalize the overall partnership treaty with Bern by the end of October, when the mandate of the current commission ends.","144":"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union\u2019s markets watchdog has proposed a temporary fix to avoid uncleared derivatives contracts worth trillions of euros being disrupted if there is a no-deal Brexit next March.  FILE PHOTO:Protesters participating in an anti-Brexit demonstration march sit at the base of Nelson's Column, in Trafalgar Square, in central London, Britain October 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Henry Nicholls  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said the changes it was proposing would give banks one year to \u201crepaper\u201d or shift their uncleared, over-the-counter derivatives positions from London to the EU.  Such moves would not trigger the requirement to clear those contracts. Counterparties can begin taking steps to shift contracts - which requires permission from the end-customer - but make any action conditional on a no-deal departure, ESMA said.  The fix falls short of the \u201cgrandfathering\u201d that industry has called for, whereby EU regulators would allow contracts spanning years to run to maturity even if Britain left the bloc without a deal.  ESMA said a general grandfathering was not appropriate and, given the urgency of the matter, it would not be holding a public consultation on its proposals.  It said EU regulators were considering a similar approach for moving derivatives contracts without triggering a requirement to post collateral.  The Bank of England last month called on the EU to urgently deal with potential disruption to cross-border uncleared contracts worth a notional 30 trillion pounds, with 18 trillion maturing after Brexit.  Britain and the EU are aiming to secure a divorce settlement that includes a business-as-usual transition period from next March to the end of 2020.  \u201cThe proposed regulatory change supports counterparties\u2019 Brexit preparations and maintains a level playing field between EU counterparties, while addressing potential risks to orderly markets and financial stability,\u201d Steven Maijoor, ESMA chair, said in a statement on Thursday.  ISDA, a global derivatives industry body, said the \u201chelpful\u201d step from ESMA would reduce one significant challenge, but there were other big hurdles to transferring so many contracts.  \u201cWe remain concerned both about the ability to expedite transfers and the inability of EU27 clients to effect lifecycle events on derivatives contracts with a UK counterparty, as of Brexit day,\u201d said Roger Cogan, head of European public policy at ISDA.  The changes outlined on Thursday will require the sign-off of the EU\u2019s executive, the European Commission.","145":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Exchange operators in Chicago and London are making contingency plans and stepping up cleaning for open-outcry futures and options trading floors as the global spread of the new coronavirus spooks markets.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Exchanges are seeking to avoid disruptions linked to the outbreak, which has roiled equities and commodities prices worldwide. The virus can cause a sometimes fatal flu-like respiratory illness.  CME Group Inc told customers that no one who had recently visited Asia or Italy, which have been hit hard by the virus, should be on its Chicago trading floor, according to a notice sent to clients on Monday. It also restricted large tour groups and sought to keep \u201cnon-essential\u201d visitors off the floor.  If the floor is closed, markets will remain available for trading electronically, according to CME. The company, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, asked employees and clients to test their ability to connect to its systems remotely.  \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, we disinfected the entire trading floor space over the weekend,\u201d CME said in the notice it shared with Reuters. \u201cWe will continue our increased cleaning procedures on the floor and common areas as well.\u201d  Open-outcry trading was a raucous tradition in which traders jostled and screamed to execute orders in pits packed with people. CME closed most futures pits in 2015 after the practice declined because of computerized trading. Products like Eurodollar and grain options are still traded in pits.  Cboe Global Markets Inc said it too was restricting visitors to its trading floor in Chicago. It also replaced some fingerprint scanners with ID badge scanners at the main entry points to its building.  The London Metal Exchange, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, has made contingency plans to relocate or ditch open-outcry trading if the coronavirus outbreak worsens.

To prevail, HKEX would have to persuade British politicians and European regulators to abandon their deep-rooted scepticism over mergers of financial exchanges.  It would also have to woo LSE shareholders who are in favor of maintaining their ownership following LSE\u2019s $27 billion deal last month to acquire financial data provider Refinitiv. In an ominous sign for the deal\u2019s prospects, LSE shares ended trading on Wednesday at a deep discount to HKEX\u2019s offer price.  With its bid, HKEX is betting that a major international acquisition will help it overcome uncertainty at home. Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests in the last few weeks over China\u2019s political influence have raised questions among major companies and investors about the appeal of the Hong Kong bourse.  HKEX is also seeking to capitalize on the weakness of the British pound, which has been hit by Britain\u2019s inability to settle on a deal to leave the European Union. The weaker pound has made British companies cheaper for foreign acquirers.  The proposed deal is aimed at creating a combined group better able to compete with U.S. rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N and CME Group inc CME.O. It is contingent on LSE abandoning the deal to acquire Refinitiv.  \u201cThe board of HKEX believes a proposed combination with LSE represents a highly compelling strategic opportunity to create a global market infrastructure leader,\u201d the Hong Kong exchange said in a statement.  The LSE said it would review HKEX's proposal. In a sign of its cool reception to HKEX's bid, it added that it was committed to, and continued to, make good progress on its planned acquisition of Refinitiv from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc BX.N and Thomson Reuters Corp TRI.TO. Thomson Reuters is the parent of Reuters News.  Spokespeople for Refinitiv, Blackstone and Thomson Reuters declined to comment.  Under the terms of the offer, LSE shareholders would receive 2,045 pence in cash and 2.495 newly issued HKEX shares. HKEX said it intended to apply for a secondary listing of its shares on the LSE once the deal has gone through.  HKEX, whose main shareholder is the Hong Kong government, said its 31.6 billion pounds cash-and-share transaction proposal represented a 22.9% premium to the LSE\u2019s closing stock price on Tuesday of 8,361 pence.  LSE shares ended trading on Wednesday only up 5.9% at 7,206 pence. The significant gap with HKEX\u2019s offer price reflects widespread scepticism that the bid will succeed, investors said.  A key challenge: Securing the support of the British government, which has already signaled some wariness over handing control of its stock exchange to a foreign acquirer with close links to China.  The UK Treasury described the LSE as a \u201ccritically important part\u201d of the British financial system. \u201cAs you would expect, the government and the regulators will be looking at the (proposed deal) details closely,\u201d a spokesman said.  \u201cIt looks uncertain whether shareholders will accept the offer, given that the Refinitiv deal is popular across the shareholder base for its potential to transform the business and add value over the long-term,\u201d said Guy de Blonay, a fund manager at Jupiter, a top-25 investor in the LSE.  A Hong Kong company acquiring one of Britain\u2019s marquee financial institutions - which also owns the Milan exchange and is a major clearing house in the United States - would be a challenging feat for HKEX.  Germany's Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE has failed three times in recent years to acquire LSE, hitting opposition from politicians and regulators.  It was also not immediately clear whether the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a government panel that scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns, would also have jurisdiction to review HKEX\u2019s bid for LSE, analysts said.  A spokesman for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, did not respond to a request for comment on whether the deal would be subject to CFIUS review.

Were it to walk away, it would have to pay Refinitiv a 198.3 million pound break-up fee.  Emboldened by the lukewarm reaction in LSE\u2019s stock, Blackstone stayed put on Wednesday, viewing HKEX\u2019s chances of success as remote, according to people familiar with the matter.  Prices of bonds issued by Refinitiv were only slightly lower in secondary trading on Wednesday, suggesting investors did not view the deal with LSE at risk.

But this year it has fallen behind, raising $10.8 billion to the NYSE's $20.2 billion, with activity suffering as the political turmoil deepened. Last month, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N delayed plans for a $15 billion offering in Hong Kong because of the unrest.  No other bid for LSE appeared forthcoming on Wednesday. Benjamin Jackson, president of New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, placed his company out of the running.  \u201cThe reasons are, you have Brexit uncertainty, you\u2019ve got valuations, you\u2019ve got deals that have to meet our internal rate of return criteria that we put forth,\u201d he said at a Barclays financial services conference on Wednesday.  In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, CME Chairman and CEO Terry Duffy also poured cold water on the idea of a bid. \u201cI just closed on my European transaction with NEX in November, and I\u2019m laser focused on the integration of that and growing our core business,\u201d Duffy said.  LSE CEO David Schwimmer has said that big takeovers in exchanges are difficult due to political concerns. In recent years the LSE has sought to diversify away from basic trading and clearing to data and analytics.  The Asian exchange, however, said it was confident its proposal faced no major regulatory hurdles due to little overlap in markets.  HKEX said it has already begun discussions with certain regulators in Britain and Hong Kong. \u201cThe board of HKEX believes that the two businesses are highly complementary and as such, looks forward to working with the relevant authorities to deliver a clear path to completion,\u201d it added.  Should the proposed takeover be successful, it is expected that key LSE management would continue to operate LSE businesses, HKEX said.  The Hong Kong government threw its support behind the move.  \u201cThe government is glad to see HKEX\u2019s endeavor to enhance its core strength and seek international expansion in accordance with its strategic plan,\u201d a spokesman said.","147":"LONDON (Reuters) - Aquis Exchange has revised its no-deal Brexit strategy in an effort to steal a march on rivals in the face of curbs on where investors can buy and sell stocks.

UK and Swiss shares would continue to be offered in London only.  Britain is due to leave the EU on Friday unless it secures a \u201cstandstill\u201d transition agreement to avoid a disruptive departure. Prime Minister Theresa May will ask an EU summit on Wednesday for a delay until at least the end of June.  \u201cMost volume in EU27 stocks would probably be done in London,\u201d Aquis Chief Executive Alasdair Haynes said in a statement.  It originally planned to offer EU27 stocks in Paris only to avoid harming prices by splitting trading.  Larger rivals Cboe and London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise, which have new EU hubs in Amsterdam, have announced similar changes. Aquis says it was going a step further by offering EU27 shares in London immediately after a no-deal Brexit to stop national exchanges in the bloc taking the business.  Cboe and Turquoise have said they would seek to reintroduce EU27 shares in London later in the year.  The EU\u2019s markets watchdog ruled last month that fund managers could only trade 6,200 shares in the bloc if Britain leaves without a deal. These are mostly EU27 listed stocks but also include 14 from Britain.  If Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority takes tit-for-tat action to require UK and many EU shares to be traded in Britain, it would give Aquis an early advantage over Turquoise and Cboe.  Such a retaliatory move was \u201chighly likely\u201d, Haynes said. The FCA has declined to comment on its plans.  Aquis will revert to its preferred plan of trading EU27 shares only in Paris when it is clear the FCA won\u2019t introduce trading curbs, Haynes said.  \u201cMy understanding is that the UK government does not want to see EU27 business move from London to Europe and will do whatever it can, unless some form of equivalence or financial services deal is agreed, to allow business to remain in London,\u201d he said.

FILE PHOTO: A oil drilling rig is seen at sunrise near Midland, Texas, U.S., May 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Ernest Scheyder\/File Photo  With just one day to go until the group holds its policy meeting, the derivatives market shows participants buying significant volumes of protection -- prepared for fireworks.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in Vienna to discuss its existing policy to curtail crude output by 1.8 million barrels per day, jointly with several non-member nations, including Russia and Oman.  A production rise of about 1 million (bpd) or around 1 percent of global supply was emerging as a consensus for the group and its allies, OPEC sources told Reuters, adding that Iran could agree under certain conditions.  CME Group's CME.O newly launched \"OPECWatch Tool\", which calculates the probability of a change in OPEC policy based on actual options trades in U.S. crude futures CLc1, shows investors are less certain about the outcome of this meeting than they have been of any of the previous four or five.  At the same time, implied volatility, a gauge of demand, has shot to its highest in well over a year in near-term bullish call options and bearish put options, showing the level of uncertainty among traders and investors over which way the pendulum may swing.  \u201cPeople are expecting to be surprised by what happens, so they\u2019re taking out risk management options on both ends of the spectrum, Owain Johnson CME managing director and head of energy research and product development said.  \u201cJust since the start of this week, the probability surprise, either on the upside or the downside, has blown out.\u201d  For graphic on CME OPECWatch Tool shows heightened uncertainty click reut.rs\/2MKU2k1  The OPECWatch tool currently shows investors and traders are attaching a 61 percent chance of the existing deal, in place since January 2017 to bring global supply and demand into balance, staying intact, compared with closer to 80 percent a week ago.  Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management said the upcoming summit was proving to be a \u201ctricky one to predict\u201d.  \u201c... the final decision is something of a toss-up. Suffice to say we expect the big players to increase their production to some extent, whether a formal deal is struck or not,\u201d he said.  UNCERTAINTY IN 3D  The Brent volatility surface, a three-dimensional representation of which options are currently most in demand, shows volatility for at-the-money options, which allow the holder to buy or sell the underlying futures contract at the current price, has hit its highest since May last year.  For graphic on Brent Crude Options Volatility Surface click reut.rs\/2M9SK0R  While it is not unusual for volatility on out-of-the-money options, those that allow the holder to buy or sell crude well above or below the current price, to fluctuate a lot right before a major risk event, it is less frequent to see this sort of movement in at-the-money options.  One options trader said hedging against OPEC-inspired volatility had become a lot more expensive in the last few days, especially given the 3 percent decline in the underlying futures price since Monday LCOc1CLc1.  Uncertainty has gradually crept in about what OPEC might do, exacerbated by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for the group to do something to cool off fuel prices, and major consumer China has done the same.  But the options has not really reflected that until the last few days.  \u201cLast week the probability of everything being \u2018safe and steady\u2019 has contracted by a relatively significant factor in options market - almost 10 (percentage) points at times,\u201d Johnson said.  Another major difference this time is the interest on the part of U.S. oil producers in preparing for whatever OPEC might do.  U.S. crude production, led by shale output, has risen by a quarter in just two years, to nearly 11 million bpd. Cargoes of U.S. oil are going into refineries around the world, often at the expense of Middle East, West African or North Sea crudes, which are linked to the Brent price.  \u201cWTI options are always the most liquid alternative to Brent, but the thing that is highlighting the trend is who are the people watching this most closely - the U.S. drillers,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cDrillers are protecting themselves particularly on the downside and more and more, sophisticated users in the airline space and others, are protecting themselves against a less likely massive cut.\u201d  For graphic on WTI crude 2018 options open interest click reut.rs\/2JWvh6Y","149":"LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Forcing banks in the European Union to shift euro clearing from the City of London would prompt a backlash among cost-conscious banks, a senior London Stock Exchange official said.  The EU has long wanted euro clearing, a core part of the City\u2019s offering as a global financial centre, relocated to the bloc to supervise risks directly, stepping up its efforts since Britain voted for Brexit.  But market users are reluctant to make the costly move.  The LSE\u2019s LCH unit clears the bulk of euro-denominated interest rate swaps bought by companies across Europe to hedge against adverse moves in borrowing costs.  \u201cIf there is a forced fragmentation, then some impacted firms may react by seeking to re-route trades via different entities,\u201d Daniel Maguire, LCH Group CEO, told Reuters.  \u201cUltimately it is critical to all participants to have unfettered access to the best liquidity and prices - even more so during volatile markets, such as we saw during March and April.\u201d  EU banks could use their non-EU based units to access the global swaps market to hedge across multiple currencies, or use foreign clearers that have EU access, like CME in the United States.  The Brexit transition period, which has maintained the status quo this year, ends on Dec. 31 and although LCH has been granted continued EU access from January, it is only for 18 months to give banks time to end what Brussels calls \u201cexcessive reliance\u201d on UK clearers, and build up the EU\u2019s capital market.  \u201cWe are very pleased with the outcome, it\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d Maguire said.  EU regulators will now assess if LCH should have permanent access, or if EU banks must switch to a bloc-based clearer.  Maguire said LCH\u2019s market share has hardly budged since Britain voted to leave the EU in 2016, despite increased efforts by Frankfurt rival Eurex to attract a bigger slice of the market.  Of the 46 trillion euros of live, open swaps in euros, around 80% is driven by counterparties outside the EU, Maguire said, meaning they are largely beyond the bloc\u2019s regulatory reach.  U.S. banks are particularly active in euro swap trades that need clearing, and this is likely to increase given how U.S. banks are making more inroads globally than their less profitable EU peers.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see what will fundamentally change, in terms of the dynamics in clearing, unless there is a mandatory relocation policy, which would cause fragmentation and remove the compelling economic efficiencies for all EU firms,\u201d Maguire said.","150":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union governments are close to agreeing new rules for handling failures of clearing houses, increasing the burden on these firms to limit losses that might rock the financial system, EU documents and sources said.  FILE PHOTO: European Union flags fly outside the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, October 4, 2019. REUTERS\/Yves Herman  The rules could set a global standard for regulators, which put clearing houses at the center of trading in over-the-counter derivatives and interest rate swaps after the 2008 financial crisis but did not agree on how to wind them down safely.  To lower risks in the multitrillion-dollar derivatives trade, clearing houses stand between both sides of a transaction and ensure its completion even if one side goes bust.  But the system is so reliant on them that they have become what analysts describe as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d, meaning they are so large that a collapse would send shock waves around the global financial system that could force governments to step in.  In what would be a major regulatory shift, EU governments are set to agree draft rules that would clearly define how to address clearing house failures, putting a higher financial burden on them and reducing costs for banks and other clients.  Draft documents prepared by the EU\u2019s Finnish presidency and seen by Reuters say clearing houses, also known as central counterparties, should use their own resources to cover losses \u201cbefore resorting to other recovery measures requiring financial contributions from clearing members.\u201d  This would double clearing houses\u2019 contributions in a crisis to 50% of capital they are required to set aside by regulators against losses.  Finland has secured a broad consensus on the draft rules so they will be adopted by EU governments if no objections are raised by a large number of them by Tuesday evening, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The EU parliament also needs to approve the rules.  The clearing business is concentrated in a few houses primarily owned by the London Stock Exchange Group plc LSE.L, International Exchange Inc ICE.N and CME Group Inc CME.O. Most trades cleared through them come from about 10 big banks.  When one party in a transaction, whether a bank or fund, cannot meet its commitments, it is first to pay for its failure by using backstop capital set aside before the transaction.  If that is not enough, under existing rules, clearing houses contribute up to 25% of their capital, before a default fund financed by banks and other clearing clients is used.  The draft rules would force central counterparties to put up more of their own capital if the default fund was not sufficient to cover losses. Banks would need to pay extra cash only if this effort from clearing houses were still not enough.  But the draft does not explicitly require central counterparties to raise more capital after a recovery, leaving it unclear how they would close any gap opened by their crisis contributions.  It also remains unclear how the new rules would apply to Europe\u2019s largest clearing houses, which operate from London, after Britain leaves the EU.","151":"LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - Swiss exports of gold to the United States leapt to 111.7 tonnes in April -- by far the biggest monthly total on record -- while shipments to other destinations dwindled, customs data showed on Tuesday. The global gold market has been turned on its head by the novel coronavirus, with demand in China and India collapsing due to lockdowns while in the West investors rushed to buy bullion as a safe asset to weather a period of financial turmoil. High prices on CME Group's Comex exchange spurred shipments to New York. Switzerland, a major trading, vaulting and refining centre for precious metals, exported a total of 131.8 tonnes of gold in April, up from 96.2 tonnes in March but slightly lower than in April 2019. The United States, which typically imports less than a tonne of gold a month from Switzerland, accounted for 85% of that total. Switzerland meanwhile shipped 500 kgs (0.5 tonnes) of gold to India, 1 kg to Hong Kong and no gold at all to China in April. Each of these destinations usually receive tens of tonnes of metal from Switzerland each month. Following are the numbers for April 2020 and comparisons.

But the price premium triggered a rush to transfer gold to New York.  Total stocks in Comex-registered vaults increased by 1.75 million ounces, or 54 tonnes, from March 26 to a four-year high of 10.5 million ounces, while the proportion put on warrant, or made available for delivery, doubled to around 40%.

Investors typically use Comex to gain exposure to gold prices and rarely ask to take metal, which costs money to store.  For that reason, far less gold is stored in New York than trades there. If gold is needed, it can be quickly flown on passenger planes from London via Swiss refiners that melt and reshape it to meet Comex specifications.

Uncertainty rules as traders try to navigate both the unprecedented demand shock of a world in lockdown and the trailing supply shocks that are accumulating from ever more mine closures.  Market turmoil has translated into surging trading volumes on all three major metals hubs in London, Shanghai and New York.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) in particular has registered a series of spectacular year-on-year increases in activity, which has been replicated across other commodity trading arenas in China.  This does not appear to be down to the day-trading crowd that has surged through the commodities space in the past, but rather a step-change in industrial user activity.  It\u2019s a similar story on both the London Metal Exchange and the CME, with evidence that speculators have cut their exposure to industrial metals even as supply-chain disruption has boosted industrial participation.  SHANGHAI SURPRISE  Shanghai trading volumes exploded in March after reduced activity in January-February, when much of the country was in lockdown.  A breakdown of activity by contract is full of surprises.  Volumes in zinc and steel rebar, both past favourites of day-traders because of their relatively low pricing and resulting low margin requirements, dropped sharply in the first quarter to the tune of 52% and 56% respectively.  These year-on-year comparisons are adjusted to factor in ShFE\u2019s change of methodology at the start of 2020. The exchange moved from double-counting buy and sell sides to single-counting transactions to conform both with international standards and financial exchanges in China.  It was tin that shone in the first quarter with volumes mushrooming to 2.25 million contracts from 571,000 in the year-earlier period.  The exchange\u2019s new stainless steel contract, launched in September last year, also attracted huge trading interest in March, with volumes of 1.19 million eclipsing last year\u2019s aggregate four-month tally.  Equally significant has been the general lift in market open interest over the first quarter, another sign that day-traders have not been the driver of the trading action.  Only two Shanghai metals contracts had lower open interest at the end of March than a year earlier - zinc and nickel.  Everything else registered strong builds, once again led by tin, which saw resting positions more than triple to 77,683 contracts from 21,757 at the end of March 2019.  LONDON BOUNCE  The London Metal Exchange (LME) prides itself on being the world\u2019s foremost forum for the world\u2019s industrial metal hedgers, so it\u2019s no surprise that volumes also exploded in March.  This marks a significant change of trend. LME volumes, including UNA (unallocated) trades, slid by 4.6% last year and were down another 2.9% in the first two months of 2020.  However, average daily activity jumped by 15% in March to 794,139 contracts. That was the highest monthly total since April 2018, an outlier month when U.S. sanctions on aluminium producer Rusal saw volumes on the exchange\u2019s most liquid contract explode.  The strong March performance lifted the LME\u2019s first-quarter volumes by 4.6% relative to last year, or by 3.1% on an average daily basis.  Increased activity was registered on all the LME\u2019s major contracts with only three smaller ones bucking the trend - tin, which was very marginally lower, North American aluminium alloy (NASAAC) and steel scrap.  Notwithstanding less action in the scrap contract, the LME\u2019s foray into the world of ferrous trading appears to be bearing fruit.  Steel rebar volumes were up by 68% year-on-year while both new hot-rolled-coil contracts, cash settled against Argus (China) and S&P Global Platts (North American), registered turnover of 30,326 contracts and 2,166 contracts respectively.  Looking less healthy are the exchange\u2019s gold and silver contracts, with cumulative volumes slumping by 94% despite the current heightened interest in gold as a safe-haven play.  The LME\u2019s attempt to break into the precious space has been struggling for several months despite a number of incentive schemes.  Also worth a mention is the LME\u2019s owner Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx), which has seen volumes accelerate on its new dollar-denominated \u201cmini\u201d base metal contracts.  The LME has tried \u201cmini\u201d contracts twice without success and HKEx\u2019s own yuan-denominated contracts have withered on the vine.  But with the dollar products, HKEx appears to be onto something. Volumes totalled 36,697 in January-March, compared with 29,334 in the first five months of trading in August-December last year.  CME ALUMINIUM CONTRACTS SHINE  Underlining the broader trend of increased industrial user activity is the sharp rise in activity in the CME\u2019s aluminium premium contracts.  All four saw trading surge in the first three months of this year, with volume increases ranging from 73% (North American) to 230% (European duty unpaid).  The exchange\u2019s aluminium futures contract has also bounced back from the dead after going international, with Asian physical delivery points added to the existing U.S. warehouse network.  After not trading at all over the course of 2018 and the first part of 2019, volumes picked up to total 9,246 contracts in the first quarter of 2020.  It\u2019s noticeable that the CME is seeing more active movement of physical aluminium stocks, particularly at Malaysia\u2019s Port Klang, which currently holds 8,998 tonnes out of total registered inventory of 23,778 tonnes.  The CME\u2019s most active industrial metals contract remains copper, which saw volumes rise by 16% in the first quarter after a 27% decline in 2019.  However, market open interest dropped sharply over the course of March, ending the month at 182,253 contracts, down 27% on March 2019.  That seems to reflect a collective exit of fund money from the copper market with money managers holding minimal long positions and covering short positions over the last two weeks.  It may be a sign of the broader fund dash for cash or of simple fatigue with volatile markets that continue to chop around on each and every update on the spread of COVID-19.  But it does underline how speculators, whether Chinese or American, have not been as active as industrial hedgers in the last couple of months.  That may well change but in the interim there is likely to be no let-up in physical supply-chain disruption over the coming months, which suggests that the big three metals exchanges are going to continue to thrive in our currently chaotic world.","154":"BEIJING (Reuters) - CME Group Inc\u2019s physical delivery of aluminum has gained traction since September after expanding its warehousing network beyond the United States into Europe and Asia, fueled by growing liquidity in Asian market, a company official said.

CME, the world\u2019s largest futures exchange operator, has been steadily building up its storage network.

Aluminum output in Asia has surged in the last 10 years, with China\u2019s production growing more than 166% since 2009, data compiled by the International Aluminum Institute showed.  The U.S. exchange extended its aluminum warehouse locations to five countries in Europe and Asia this year, expanding its footprint to 14 warehouses in 10 locations worldwide.  China, the world\u2019s top aluminum producer, churned out 23.47 million tonnes of aluminum in the first eight months of 2019.  Asia and China continue to be key areas for the bourse\u2019s growth strategy in the metals complex, Young-Jin said.  Besides Malaysia and Singapore, CME also launched warehouses for zinc and lead in South Korea on top of the two countries.  \u201cAt this time we do not have a plan to expand copper beyond the U.S. warehousing,\u201d she said.

Today\u2019s gain was probably triggered by an order worth about $100 million spread across U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and Luxembourg\u2019s Bitstamp, said Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, chief executive of cryptocurrency firm BCB Group.  \u201cThere has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across these three venues, of around 20,000 BTC,\u201d he said.  \u201cIf you look at the volumes on each of those three exchanges \u2013 there were in-concert, synchronized, units of volume of around 7,000 BTC in an hour\u201d.  Still, analysts could not point to any specific developments that could explain the mystery buyer\u2019s big order.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Cryptocurrency markets had until today seen a period of relative calm through the year, with bitcoin trading around $3,300 and $4,200.  Big institutional investors have largely stayed on the sidelines. Concern over security breaches and regulatory uncertainty were cited as reasons for the lack of mainstream enthusiasm in digital coins.  In a sign of bitcoin\u2019s failure to gain an equal footing with conventional markets, Cboe Global Markets - which offered the first U.S. bitcoin futures contracts in 2017 - said last month it would no longer offer bitcoin futures contracts.  CME Group Inc continues to list its futures product, which launched soon after Cboe.

Big orders tend to spark buying by algorithmic traders, said Charlie Hayter, founder of industry website CryptoCompare.  As bitcoin surged, 6 million trades occurred in an hour, Hayter said - three to four times the usual amount, with orders concentrated on Asian-based exchanges.  Bitcoin\u2019s surge sent smaller cryptocurrencies, known as \u201caltcoins,\u201d trading higher. Ethereum\u2019s ether and Ripple\u2019s XRP, respectively the second- and third-largest coins, both jumped by more than 10 percent.  Price moves of smaller coins tend to be correlated to bitcoin, which still accounts for just over half of the value of the cryptocurrency market.  \u201cUsually bitcoin is the leader of the market and altcoins tend to follow, as far as direction and sentiment is concerned,\u201d said Mati Greenspan, an analyst at eToro in Israel. \u201cToday bitcoin is in the driving seat.\u201d","157":"LONDON (Reuters) - Big cross-border mergers in stock exchanges look \u201chard\u201d given political opposition to opening up bourses to foreign ownership, London Stock Exchange Group Chief Executive David Schwimmer said on Wednesday.  FILE PHOTO: The London Stock Exchange Group offices are seen in the City of London, Britain, December 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo  \u201cThere have been some big painful failures out there in the industry,\u201d Schwimmer told the annual FIA IDX derivatives industry conference.  The LSE has failed several times to merge with rival Deutsche Boerse, the most recent attempt ending with Schwimmer\u2019s appointment as CEO last August. The deal failed in part because of opposition from local politicians in Frankfurt.  A former Goldman Sachs banker of 20 years, Schwimmer raised expectations of big deals, but he has instead focused on relatively modest transactions, like taking a small stake in settlement house Euroclear.  \u201cThere will continue to be this nationalistic focus on exchanges in particular. I think it\u2019s hard to think about doing big cross-border exchange-type transactions. It just feels challenging for the industry,\u201d Schwimmer said.  LSE has had the \u201cluxury\u201d of double-digit organic growth in businesses like clearing and information services for years and this is likely to \u201cpersist\u201d, Schwimmer said.  M&A is part of the toolkit, but the exchange will be \u201ccareful about it, be very strategic about it, very disciplined about it\u201d, Schwimmer said.  Curve Global, 40% owned by the LSE and aimed at breaking the dominance of Deutsche Boerse and ICE in interest rate futures in Europe, was finally making headway after \u201cbumping along the bottom\u201d since its launch in 2016, he said.  \u201cWe are getting traction now,\u201d Schwimmer said.  After its launch market participants became tied up with preparing for the European Union\u2019s new MiFID II securities rules and then for Brexit, he said.  \u201cAs we got to the end of last year and the beginning of this year, we have seen a substantial pick-up in volume, a couple of hundred percent growth rate on an annualized basis.\u201d  Market share is about 10% in some products, rising to 40% in futures based on Sonia, the new benchmark for replacing sterling-denominated Libor, he said.  \u201cI would attribute it to market desire to have competition,\u201d Schwimmer said.  The LSE is \u201cvery prepared\u201d for Brexit, he added. The exchange has had to open an EU base in Amsterdam for its London-based pan-European share trading platform Turquoise.  Schwimmer expects the LSE\u2019s clearing house LCH in London, which dominates euro-denominated clearing in Europe, to obtain permanent EU authorization to continue serving customers in the bloc after Brexit.","158":"LONDON (Reuters) - More than 275 financial firms are moving a combined $1.2 trillion (\u00a3925 billion) in assets and funds and thousands of staff from Britain to the European Union in readiness for Brexit at a cost of up to $4 billion, a report from a think tank said on Monday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  UK lawmakers are due to vote on Tuesday on an EU divorce settlement. But with less than three weeks to go before Brexit day on March 29, it is still unclear whether the deal will be approved, whether departure from the EU will be delayed, or whether it will happen without agreement.  The report by the New Financial think tank, one of the most detailed yet on the impact of Brexit on financial services, said Dublin alone accounted for 100 relocations, ahead of Luxembourg with 60, Paris 41, Frankfurt 40, and Amsterdam 32.  The independent think tank said half of the affected asset management firms, such as Goldman Sachs Investment Management, Morgan Stanley Investment Management and Vanguard, had chosen Dublin, with Luxembourg the next port of call, attracting firms like Schroders, JP Morgan Wealth Management and Aviva Investors.  Nearly 90 percent of all firms moving to Frankfurt are banks, while two-thirds of those going to Amsterdam are trading platforms or brokers. Paris is carving out a niche for markets and trading operations of banks and attracting a broad spread of firms.  New Financial identified 5,000 expected staff moves or local hires, a figure that is expected to rise in coming years.  A better measure of Brexit\u2019s impact is the scale of assets and funds being transferred, it said.  Ten large banks and investment banks are together moving 800 billion pounds of assets from Britain - or 10 percent of banking assets in the country. A small selection of insurers have shifted a combined 35 billion pounds in assets, and a handful of asset managers have moved a total of 65 billion pounds in funds.  William Wright, founder and managing director of New Financial, said the hit to London was bigger than expected and would get worse.  \u201cBusiness will continue to leak from London to the EU, with more activity being booked through local subsidiaries,\u201d Wright said.  \u201cThis will reduce the UK\u2019s influence in European banking and finance, reduce tax receipts from the industry, and reduce financial services exports to the EU.\u201d  A 10 percent shift in banking and finance activity would cut UK tax receipts by about 1 percent, the report said.  Relocations have cost firms $3 billion to $4 billion, which will be passed on to customers and shareholders, the report said.  But the breadth and depth of relocations so far, combined with pacts between regulators in Britain and the EU, mean the industry is well prepared for whatever form Brexit takes, New Financial said.  London will remain the dominant financial centre for the foreseeable future, but other European cities will chip away at London\u2019s lead over time, it added.

FILE PHOTO: A man wearing a protective face mask walks past the Singapore Exchange (SGX) which stays open during \"circuit breaker\" measures to curb coronavirus COVID-19) in central business district area in Singapore, April 7, 2020. REUTERS\/Edgar Su  The global exchange sector, which thrives in turbulent markets, has outperformed so far this year, falling only 2% in value compared with a 15% drop in world stocks, a Reuters analysis showed.  As countries around the world went into lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus, investors repriced the value of assets including stocks, commodities and derivatives, such as futures and options, to reflect recessions. That led to a surge in trading activity as investors tried to hedge positions, while others made bets on where markets were going to bottom out.  Financial exchanges, such as Singapore Exchange Ltd SGXL.SI, Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE and New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N, all saw profits jump as trading-based fee revenues surged.  Asia\u2019s bourses, which are more reliant on volumes than their global peers, have gained the most, the analysis showed, as investors reckon they are best placed to benefit from further volatility.  \"I think on balance the trends that have been in place will continue for quite a while,\" said Scott Gilchrist, who manages an A$680 million ($440 million) portfolio of Japanese stocks at Australia's Platinum Asset Management PTM.AX.  \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to tell, but my sense - and it\u2019s only a gut feel - is that we haven\u2019t fully passed through this period of volatility yet,\u201d he said.  Gilchrist's fund has been increasing exposure to Japan's GMO Internet Inc 9449.T, owner of a forex trading platform where volumes have been surging, as has GMO's stock, up 9% this year, compared with a 17% drop on Japan's TOPIX index .TOPX.

Elsewhere, Deutsche Boerse is up about 3% year-to-date and NYSE-owner ICE is up just under 1%, compared to declines in the DAX .GDAXI and Dow Jones Industrial .DJI indexes of around 19% and 16.5%, respectively.  Graphic - Singapore exchange's out-performance:  ASIA\u2019S STRATEGY PAYS OFF  Investors have sought out Asia\u2019s exchanges for their high exposure to trading volumes, driving share prices up almost 3% this year compared with declines of about 1% for U.S. exchanges and 5% in Europe.  Over the past decade as U.S. and European peers diversified by purchasing data providers and other adjacent businesses to bring in non-trading revenue, which is more stable, Asia\u2019s bourses tended to pursue new financial products, leaving them more dependent on trading revenues, but also with lower debt.  \"Everyone's really concerned about recapitalisations, refinancing,\" said John Pearce, chief investment officer of Australian pension fund UniSuper, the top shareholder of domestic bourse operator ASX Ltd ASX.AX.  \u201cWell, the ASX has got none of those concerns - it\u2019s got no debt and market volatility is actually positive for the ASX, so what you\u2019re really seeing is the market pricing it as a pretty stable annuity,\u201d he said.  Graphic - Exchanges monthly trade volume by region:  To be sure, a repeat of the stratospheric trade volumes of March seems unlikely, especially considering the scale and breadth of the liquidation during the sell-down.  But investors have pointed to Singapore's diversification across asset classes from forex to commodities, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing House Ltd's 0388.HK exposure to China, and technology investment by ASX as boosting long-term prospects.  \u201cRecent outperformance, or resilience, is driven mostly by market volatility,\u201d said Kristy Fong, senior investment director of Asian equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Singapore, whose funds own all three stocks. \u201cWe see these stock exchanges as a good proxy for markets, and given that they are pretty much monopolies with good cash flow, it is quite a safe way to get exposure.\u201d  Graphic - IPOs at leading exchanges in the first quarter:  MONETARY HEADWINDS  Policymakers responded to the coronavirus crisis by slashing interest rates and flooding markets with liquidity. That prevented a quick wave of mass defaults, boosting investor confidence and dampening the wild market swings of March.  The potential for a prolonged bout of rock-bottom rates and lower volatility presents the biggest headwind for exchange operators.  Record trading volumes in the first quarter eased into the second quarter as volatility declined, Ed Tilly, chief executive of Chicago-based stock and options exchange operator Cboe Global Markets CBOE.Z, said on an earnings call last week.  \u201cNo one can say with certainty how this situation will play out, but the path to recovery is unlikely to be linear,\u201d he said.  CME Group CME.O, the world's biggest futures exchange operator and also based in Chicago, saw average daily volumes halve last month, compared with March.  Nevertheless, volumes are up from a year ago and CME\u2019s executives were upbeat about the outlook on an earnings call last week.  Other operators have seen silver linings, such as a surge in emergency capital-raising in Australia, benefiting ASX.  \u201cI wish every company we owned was trading like ASX,\u201d said UniSuper\u2019s Pearce.

The sun is seen behind a crude oil pump jack in the Permian Basin in Loving County, Texas, U.S., November 22, 2019. Picture taken November 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Angus Mordant  Oil prices have been pummeled by the double-whammy of lower demand due to coronavirus and oversupply as Saudi Arabia and Russia tussle for a majority of market share. U.S. crude futures have lost more than 50% in the past two weeks, and more wild swings could be in store.  This week\u2019s action was dominated by hedge funds, money managers and other speculators who have tried to find the bottom in a market that keeps falling, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.  On Thursday, April U.S. crude futures gained so much late in the day that trading was automatically halted for two minutes of post-settlement trade due to a built-in circuit breaker to curb volatility. On Friday, the opposite happened: the futures contract fell more than $4 in the last half-hour of trade before the contract expired.  \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy market. I don\u2019t know how to trade this,\u201d one futures trader said.  Speculators increased their long positions in the period up to Tuesday, according to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, even as prices plunged. Such traders tend to jump in and out to profit swiftly, but flee when markets move against them.  For commercial buyers, oil companies that can take physical delivery of the crude, there is less pressure to exit ahead of expiration. For so-called paper traders, like hedge funds, the pressure is on: sell or risk having to find a place to store 1,000 barrels of physical crude oil for every contract held.  \u201cThe speculative community rode their position into the close, and it\u2019s a difficult position to exit at the end of the day and at the end of the contract\u2019s life,\u201d Yawger said. \u201cThey should get out when it turns red. They sit there hoping it goes back to green, and instead the market gets pummeled by consecutive waves of bad news and they\u2019re paralyzed.\u201d  Prices often move late on Fridays, as traders work to reduce risk going into a weekend. Such moves were common as prices pulled back in late 2008.  CME Group Inc, operator of the world\u2019s largest commodities exchange, has raised margins for trading NYMEX crude oil futures by 20.4%, to $5,600 per contract.

FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: Gold bars at the Austrian Gold and Silver Separating Plant in Vienna, Austria, March 18, 2016. REUTERS\/Leonhard Foeger\/File Photo\/File Photo  The world\u2019s largest 50 investment banks are on track to double their income from precious metals this year to around $2.5 billion, most of it from gold, Coalition, a banking consultancy, told Reuters.  \u201c$1.2 billion was the earnings pool last year. This year we already crossed that number,\u201d said Coalition research director Amrit Shahani.  The juicy rewards, which have not previously been reported, mark a stunning reversal of fortune for bullion banks. In March, some had to wipe hundreds of millions of dollars off their trading books as the global pandemic snarled the supply of gold bars.  That disruption sowed the seeds for the current bonanza.  Stung by the losses, many big banks lowered their trading limits on the Comex exchange CME.O in New York, the biggest gold futures market, creating a lack of liquidity that pushed prices there above prices in London, the main hub for trading physical gold, and elsewhere.  The divergence created a lucrative opportunity for banks who have the infrastructure to buy metal outside the United States and deliver it to New York to profit on the difference, especially during a pandemic, when investor demand has pushed gold prices XAU= to record levels of around $2,000 an ounce.  Reduced trading by large banks also drove prices of later-dated futures far above near-dated ones -- an opportunity for those with gold to sell it forward for more than enough money to cover the cost of storage and capital.  The confluence of events has created a boom in profits on Comex, 13 sources at banks, brokers and funds told Reuters.  \u201cIt\u2019s free money,\u201d said an executive at one of the largest bullion-trading banks.  Graphic - Gold rush:  Even banks that reduced activity on Comex are making more money there than before, industry players said, none of whom was authorised to speak to the media.  \u201cIt\u2019s double the profit on half the position,\u201d a second banker said.  Banks, some hedge funds and asset managers that did little or no business on Comex have stepped up their activity, sources said and data from CME Group, which runs the Comex exchange, showed.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Graphic - Comex gold open interest vs gold prices:  CME provides little data showing activity of individual actors on its market, but numbers that are available show banks including Goldman Sachs GS.N, Morgan Stanley MS.N and Citi C.N have ramped up trade in gold in vaults registered with the exchange in recent months, either delivering metal or accepting bars which they can sell forward.  Lenders such as Wells Fargo WFC.N, BNP Paribas BNPP.PA, Royal Bank of Canada RY.TO and Barclays BARC.L have also made or taken deliveries of gold against futures contracts after long periods of little or no activity.  With profits running high, not only from Comex but also from trading, financing and storing gold outside the futures exchange, some banks are hiring.  Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE is adding a third person to its recently revived precious metals team, four sources said.  Citi, Bank of America BAC.N, French lender Natixis CNAT.PA and Australia's Westpac WBC.AX have also hired in precious metals this year, according to sources and LinkedIn profiles.  The banks either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.  \u201cWe have seen strong growth in our precious metals markets this year, as new and existing customers use our products to manage uncertainty in today\u2019s global economy,\u201d said CME\u2019s head of metals, Young-Jin Chang.  THE CASH AND CARRY OPPORTUNITY  Before the pandemic struck, banks such as HSBC HSBA.L and JPMorgan JPM.N that dominate gold trading would buy metal in London and hedge their price risk by selling futures on Comex.  This allowed them to create liquidity in both places, but rested on assumptions that gold could quickly be shipped to New York if needed and that prices in the two markets would remain close together.  Those assumptions fell apart in March, when the virus shut supply routes. The link between London and New York ruptured, prices diverged sharply, and activity fell in both markets.  Graphic - Gold trading volumes:  Futures prices became unmoored from London rates, sometimes trading cheaper but often $20 or more an ounce higher, and higher still compared to Asian countries.  With supply routes now reopened and the price premium outweighing the cost of making and shipping bars, which bankers say has ranged between $0.50 and $10 an ounce this year, more than 700 tonnes of gold worth some $45 billion at current prices has moved to New York since March, CME data show.  Before that influx, vaults registered with the exchange held less than 300 tonnes.  Flows of gold to the United States have begun to ebb, but another money making opportunity also opened in a transaction known as a roll, in which, every few months, investors in futures must swap expiring contracts for later-dated ones.  To swap the February 2020 contract for the April one cost around $6 per ounce of gold, CME and Refinitiv data show -- or around $240 million in total for the roughly 400,000 100-ounce contracts trading.  When the London-futures connection broke and banks became reluctant to sell in unlimited quantities, the price rose. To roll from June to August cost around $15 an ounce on average. The longer, four-month roll from August to December cost $25 an ounce -- or $1 billion in total for 400,000 contracts.  A boon for the seller, the market is costly for futures buyers.  \u201cThere is no free lunch,\u201d said a source at a large U.S. bank. \u201cSomebody has to lose money along the way ... those people (with long positions) are every time paying money to those willing to take the other side.\u201d  The scope for big profits has attracted more sellers into the market, from smaller banks to hedge funds and asset managers.  A further uptick in futures supply could eventually temper profits, particularly if it\u2019s accompanied by a drop in demand, but in the meantime, banks are coining it, both by managing their own trading books and facilitating trades by new entrants.  \u201cThe amount of business we\u2019ve done with hedge funds around this is unprecedented,\u201d said one banker, adding that his desk\u2019s profits from gold were already double last year\u2019s total.  \u201cIt\u2019s a glaringly obvious cash and carry opportunity.\u201d","166":"(Repeats story from earlier Thursday with no change to text)  NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are locking in prices for their production as much as three years into the future in a sign that strong domestic crude pricing is nearing a peak, according to market sources familiar with money flows.  U.S. crude prices for 2019 and 2020 , based on an average of each year\u2019s monthly contracts, have climbed this week above $68 and $64 a barrel, respectively, the highest levels in over three years. The rally comes even as front-month prices have dropped from the 3-1\/2-year highs touched during the summer.  \u201cHedging activity has picked up considerably over recent weeks and this will continue to be the case as producers begin to frame budgets for next year,\u201d said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, noting the rally in forward prices are encouraging the producer bets.  Hedging can reduce risks associated with volatility in oil prices, acting as an insurance contract to lock in a future selling price and fix spending plans. Such longer-term bets signal U.S. producers will continue to expand output, keeping a lid on prices, according to crude traders and brokers.  The nation\u2019s output this year has climbed above 10 million barrels per day (bpd), close to top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. That output is forecast to grow next year by 840,000 bpd to average 11.5 million bpd.  There was a large uptick in crude swap activity last week, with just shy of 8 million barrels changing hands in a day, an energy derivatives broker said, signaling strong hedging interest. Swaps are a type of contract that allow producers to lock in or fix the price they receive for their oil production.  Almost 80 percent of the swap activity was split evenly between calendars 2020 and 2019, and the remaining 20 percent for this year, the broker said, adding that there was a small amount of calendar 2021 activity during the week.  The market sources declined to say which oil companies were actively hedging in recent weeks.  The move to hedge at these levels could prove risky for producers in a market where the price of oil for immediate delivery is higher than for later deliveries.  Many U.S. shale producers hedged second-quarter production at about $55 a barrel, which backfired as U.S. crude climbed to more than $70 a barrel last quarter, the highest level since 2014.  As a result, producers are using more \u201ccollars,\u201d a financial instrument that provides price protection on the downside while allowing them to share in some of the upside if prices rally.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been building a lot of collar structures,\u201d Christian Kendall, chief executive of Denbury Resources Inc said last week, noting that the instruments will protect its production at about $60 a barrel and provide upside if oil rises to the high $70s per barrel.  Denbury is nearly 50 percent hedged for 2019 and will add hedges to get to 60 percent to 70 percent of production, Kendall said.  Meanwhile, oil companies that drill in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where local prices are $14 below futures WTC-WTM because of full pipelines, are turning to a type of hedge geared to protecting them against regional weaknesses.  \u201cWe have done an extensive amount of basis hedging,\u201d said Javan Ottoson, chief executive of SM Energy Co, which reported 11.2 million barrels of 2019 Permian oil production covered by basis hedges compared with 6.9 million barrels of 2018 production similarly covered at this time last year.  Permian producers increased their 2020 oil-basis hedge positions by more than fourfold last quarter over the prior quarter with Concho Resources Inc and Energen Corp leading the surge, said consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  For 2019, Midland-Cushing basis hedging rose by 52 percent and the consultancy attributed the sharp increases to worries that new pipelines may be delayed past their planned startups beginning in 2019.  Open interest in U.S. crude futures for delivery in 13 months to 36 months and beyond has grown in almost every month so far in 2018, CME Group Inc said.

Spot gold lost as much as 1% and was 0.4% down at $1,654.83 an ounce by 1212 GMT, having touched a one-month high of $1,671.40. \"Risk appetite is back in the markets as new infections are declining.

Lengths of copper tubing in a file photo. REUTERS\/Phil Noble  Trading sources added that stocks in these two locations are likely to keep rising until prices are high enough to offset costs of transporting the copper.  Copper stocks held in warehouses registered with COMEX CME.O in the United States stand at 228,428 tonnes, up from below 90,000 tonnes at the start of 2017.  Specifically, stocks in COMEX warehouses in Salt Lake City, Utah have climbed to 131,774 tonnes from around 30,000 tonnes in January last year, while those in Tucson, Arizona are up at 74,427 tonnes from below 50,000.  \u201cTrucking costs are generally higher,\u201d said Robert Edwards, a consultant at CRU Group. \u201cPremiums in the physical market are just not attractive enough for anyone to try and move metal out of warehouses in Tucson or Salt Lake City.\u201d  Physical market transactions are typically based on a premium - currently about $130 a ton in the United States - over a price set on futures exchanges such as COMEX and the London Metal Exchange.  U.S. premiums are up more than 10 percent since November, but they are still not high enough to cover the costs of transporting the copper to the country\u2019s industrial heartland in the Midwest or to consumers in Asia.  Sources said the cost of taking copper from a warehouse in Arizona, loading it into a container, then onto a truck, driving it to a seaport, unloading the container there and loading onto a vessel could cost between $120 and $150 a ton.  That is about double the level at the end of 2016, sources said, adding that the freight from a U.S. port to top consumer China is a further $40 a ton.  Reasons for rising transport costs include the jump in oil prices and strong U.S. economic growth, which has meant increasing demand for industrial transport.  \u201cTighter restrictions on the numbers of hours truck drivers in the U.S. can be on the road have also driven up costs,\u201d a commodity trading source said.  He added that incentive payments - sometimes more than $40 a ton - by warehouses to firms that store copper in Salt Lake City and Tucson had helped offset the costs of getting the metal to those locations.  \u201cThe longer you agree to leave your metal in a warehouse, the better the incentive ... A fair amount of the copper in those locations comes from local producers and a large amount is Latin America production, which would previously have gone to China.\u201d  Latin America is a major producer of Sx-Ew copper, which uses solvent extraction and electrowinning, and for which demand is soft as consumers in China prefer ER - electro-refined - copper. China accounts for nearly half of global demand for refined copper, estimated at around 23 million tonnes this year.  \u201cPlayers in the Chinese market have always preferred ER to Sx-Ew cathode,\u201d said Eleni Joannides, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie. \u201cCertainly during 2017, the ER cathode market in China was more liquid compared with Sx-Ew cathode. That could be one factor behind the higher demand for ER over Sx-Ew now.\u201d  Some sources say COMEX warehouse rents for copper at around $10 a ton a month, or assuming a 30-day month about 33 U.S. cents a day, are an incentive as the average for warehouses approved by the LME is around 51 cents a day per ton.  \u201cThat is a superficial comparison, there are so many other costs to take into account - labor costs, charges for loading, unloading and cancellation charges,\u201d a copper trader said.

IHS Markit, a financial information company, said the share of euro denominated rate swaps trading on SEFs doubled from 11% in December to almost 23% in the first two weeks of January.  \u201cOf course, the real cost of fractured global liquidity is more expensive hedging and ultimately higher costs to end users,\u201d said Kirston Winters, managing director at IHS Markit.

CME Group Inc has restricted large tour groups from its trading floor in Chicago and asked customers and staff to keep out \u201cnon-essential\u201d visitors, according to a notice sent to clients on Monday. It said no one who has recently visited Asia or Italy, which have been hit hard by the virus, should be on the floor.

The company, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, asked employees and clients to test their ability to connect to its systems remotely.  \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, we disinfected the entire trading floor space over the weekend,\u201d CME said in the notice it shared with Reuters. \u201cWe will continue our increased cleaning procedures on the floor and common areas as well.\u201d  Open-outcry trading was a once-raucous tradition in which traders jostled and screamed to execute orders in pits packed with people. The practice has declined sharply since the rise of computerized trading. CME closed most open-outcry futures pits in 2015, although products like Eurodollar and grain options are still traded in pits.  The London Metal Exchange, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, has made contingency plans to relocate or ditch open-outcry trading if coronavirus worsens in Britain.

The skyline with its financial district and the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB) are photographed in the early evening in Frankfurt, Germany, December 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Kai Pfaffenbach  Coeure questioned proposals that would give the ECB greater control over central clearing counterparties (CCPs) from outside the European Union while leaving domestic ones under the authority of domestic supervisors.  \u201cA responsible central bank cannot extend liquidity to any entity without having a minimum level of information and control over it,\u201d said Coeure, who oversees the bank\u2019s market operations and international relations.  \u201cIt would be rather strange if such differentiation were to make it more difficult for us to provide liquidity to EU than to third-country CCPs,\u201d he told an ECB event.  Clearing houses, essentially the middle man between buyers and sellers of financial assets, have come into greater focus due to Brexit because much of the euro clearing business takes place in the London Stock Exchange\u2019s LCH clearing arm.  Britain is due to leave the EU next month, putting it out of direct reach of the bloc\u2019s regulators.  To remedy this, the EU is approving a law that would mean LCH and other major foreign clearing houses could only serve EU customers if the bloc\u2019s regulators supervise them alongside their home watchdog.  During a major market crisis, the ECB could have a say in how much cash or margin a foreign clearing house would require customers to set aside against euro denominated trades.  U.S. regulators have voiced opposition to such potential interference in U.S. clearers like ICE and CME, while LCH has said clearing firms\u2019 home regulators should be in charge during a crisis.  Terry Duffy, chairman and chief executive of CME Group, said he was concerned, adding that the ECB should have no right to discuss margin policy at a foreign entity.  \u201cBy law, in the United States, I can only have one regulator and that is the CFTC,\u201d Duffy told reporters in London.  \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be telling Europe how to regulate their markets, and Europe should not be telling the U.S. how to regulate their markets,\u201d Duffy said.","176":"BEIJING (Reuters) - China plans to launch its long-awaited crude oil futures contract on March 26, the country\u2019s securities regulator said on Friday, a move that could potentially shake up pricing of the world\u2019s largest commodity market.  FILE PHOTO: A worker walks down stairs of an oil tank at a refinery in Wuhan, Hubei province, China March 23, 2012. REUTERS\/Stringer\/File Photo  Chang Depeng, a spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), gave the launch date at a regular briefing in Beijing, confirming what two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier on Friday.  The launch will mark the culmination of a years-long push by China to create Asia\u2019s first oil futures benchmark, and is aimed at giving the world\u2019s biggest oil importer more clout in pricing crude sold to Asia.  It will potentially give the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), which will operate the new contract, a share of the trillions of dollars each year in oil futures trading.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) and INE, which is part of the ShFE, declined to comment.  Asia has become the world\u2019s biggest oil consuming region, and China hopes its own derivative crude contract will better reflect market conditions in the region.  The two most active oil futures contracts in the world are the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1 contract offered by the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), owned by CME Group CME.O, and the Brent LCOc1 contract offered by the Intercontinental Exchange ICE.N from London.  WTI futures are an important component of physical oil prices in the Americas, while Brent plays a vital role for prices for Middle Eastern, European and Asian crude.  Most physical oil trades globally are hedged using those two crude derivatives.  The creation of the yuan-denominated contract, which will be open to Chinese and overseas investors, was originally expected about six years ago, but has run into delays as turmoil in China\u2019s stock markets and other commodity futures raised concerns about its capacity to handle financial turbulence.  The proposal was put on the backburner early last year. Potential international participants worried they would not be able to freely exchange the yuan because of a Chinese clampdown on capital outflows, and were concerned at Beijing\u2019s heavy handed intervention in its commodity markets.  John Browning, chief operating officer of Hong Kong-based futures broker Bands Financial Ltd, which has been approved by the CSRC as an overseas intermediary for the INE, said international participation in the contract was crucial to ensure INE pricing truly reflects global trade flows.  \u201cThe principal driver for the choice of this contract is to enable China to develop its own benchmark for oil pricing while increasing the trade of renminbi-denominated oil,\u201d Browning said in a statement, using another name for the Chinese currency.  But while the contract will be quoted in yuan, \u201cthe exchange will accept USD as collateral for initial margin,\u201d opening the way for participation by non-Chinese companies, he added.","177":"May 8 (Reuters) - CME Group Inc:  * CME GROUP ANNOUNCES FIRST TRADES OF NEW SOFR FUTURES  * CME GROUP - TOTAL VOLUME THROUGH FIRST TRADING DAY OF NEW SECURED OVERNIGHT FINANCING RATE FUTURES CONTRACT WAS 3,257 CONTRACTS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","178":"NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Wall Street could see sharp swings in trading after the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election. But there are safeguards in place to keep the stock market or equity futures from sliding out of control. Here is a guide to what exchanges do to halt trading if shares fall sharply.  FUTURES MARKETS SAFEGUARDS  Price limits and circuit breakers are safeguards meant to stop a market from moving too far or too fast over a specific period of time, according to the CME Group, the world\u2019s biggest futures market operator.  In 2016, markets were betting on a win by Democrat Hillary Clinton and stock futures reacted violently here when it became clear late on election night that Republican challenger Donald Trump would become president.  S&P 500 futures, which trade on CME\u2019s Chicago Mercantile Exchange, plunged as investors scrambled to adjust positions. But once down 5%, the contract hit a price limit, meaning it could not trade lower, only sideways or up.  Price limits vary depending on the futures contract, but represent the maximum price range permitted for the contract to trade during each trading session.  CME\u2019s equity index futures price limits during the overnight session are now set at 7%, from 5% previously, either up or down.  Circuit breakers are a kind of price limit, but are more dynamic.  For U.S. equities futures, if a contract moves more than 3.5% up or down within a 60-minute period during the overnight session, trading is paused for two minutes to give market participants a chance to cancel, modify or place new orders, before reopening.  Once reopened, the rolling one-hour time frame resets and the next level of circuit breaker comes into effect, and so on, until the hard 7% price limit is reached.  STOCK MARKET SAFEGUARDS  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission mandated the creation of market-wide circuit breakers to prevent a repeat of the Oct. 19, 1987, market crash, when the Dow plunged 22.6%.  Current guidelines mandate a 15-minute market-wide pause in all U.S. stocks if the S&P 500 index falls more than 7% before 3:25 p.m. New York time.  Another circuit breaker kicks in if the index\u2019s decline hits 13% before 3:25 p.m., and trading is suspended for the session if the drop reaches 20%.  Circuit breakers were triggered here during the opening hour on March 9, 12 and 16 this year after the S&P 500 dropped 7% from its previous closing levels, and tripped later in the day on March 18, as coronavirus-driven volatility peaked.  WHAT IF AN EXCHANGE GOES DOWN?  On July 8, 2015, a technical glitch forced Intercontinental Exchange Inc's New York Stock Exchange to suspend trading here for several hours. But trading continued as normal on the other 10 U.S. stock exchanges.  There are now 16 stock exchanges, as well as around 30 private stock trading venues run by broker dealers, where trading can take place.  In August 2013, a technical problem froze trading here in all Nasdaq-listed stocks for three hours, leading the SEC to call for a meeting of Wall Street executives to insure \"continuous and orderly\" functioning of the markets.  CAN THE ENTIRE MARKET BE SHUT DOWN?  On Oct. 29 and 30, 2012, markets were closed here after Superstorm Sandy, the worst storm to hit New York City in nearly 75 years. The NYSE closed its trading floor due to unsafe conditions in lower Manhattan.  The exchange had planned to go fully electronic, but with much of Wall Street unprepared for the transition and running on skeleton staffing, traders and regulators felt uncomfortable with the idea and it was shelved.  The markets have also closed due to other factors, including the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when markets were shuttered until Sept. 17 to avoid panic selling.  HOW PREPARED ARE STOCK EXCHANGES TODAY?  U.S. stock exchanges conduct regular testing of their systems, including for capacity and volatility issues.  Nearly all U.S. stock trading is done electronically, with only the NYSE still operating an open outcry trading floor for some trades. But the Big Board closed its floor for two months here at the outset of the pandemic and operated fully electronically without a hitch.  The SEC also introduced a rule called Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity in 2014 to hold exchanges to a higher level of accountability over emergency preparedness, and the bourses do regular testing of their backup facilities.

The platform will set physical premiums and discounts for cash-settled futures warrants depending on the commodity\u2019s location, quality and brand.  In commodities trading, buyers typically pay a premium on top of or receive a discount from the underlying futures price for the physical delivery of the product.  \u201cThe trade aims to promote a premium and discount pricing mechanism among different brands, grades and delivery regions of the commodities, and improve efficiency of commodities trading,\u201d ShFE said in a statement.  It did not give a date for the launch.  All ShFE\u2019s futures products - from ferrous and base metals to precious metals, energy and chemicals - would be available on the platform but only companies would be allowed to participate not individuals, it said.  That suggests the bourse wants to limit the platform to industrial users, such as copper fabricators, aluminium smelters or chemical makers, helping avoid big physical price swings.  Small commodities trading platform investors tend to trade on a short-term basis, often causing price volatility.  ShFE\u2019s planned platform aimed to make trading more transparent and reduce risks, the bourse said. Margins would not be applied, with full payment required upfront, it said.  The move mirrors that of its U.S. rival CME Group Inc , which has launched cash-settled U.S. premium contracts for aluminium and copper in recent years.  The London Metal Exchange, the world\u2019s oldest and largest metals marketplace, has said it also plans to introduce cash-settled regional aluminium premiums in the future.  The initiative also comes as China\u2019s commodities derivatives exchanges have started opening up to foreign investors for the first time, part of an long-term effort to increase their influence over global prices of everything from oil to copper.  In March, Shanghai launched a crude oil contract, the first commodity derivatives futures market to be open to international investors. This month, Dalian Commodity Exchange took a similar step, giving foreign players access to its iron ore futures.  In the past decade, the Shanghai exchange has captured a greater share of global metals futures trading volumes from the LME as the country has grown into the world\u2019s top consumer and producer of metals.  Turnover has also boomed as China\u2019s burgeoning middle class has developed an appetite for investing in financial markets.

Copper trading activity slumped in the immediate aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic as funds and speculators fled from high volatility.

Graphic: CME Copper Volumes Surge in September -  Graphic: Comex Copper Long Spec Position Jumps to Highest since 2018 -  On the London Metal Exchange, the world\u2019s biggest market for industrial metals, volumes were not as strong, partly because speculative trading is balanced with physical hedging activity, which the pandemic dampened.  \u201cIf you\u2019re not sure how many fridge freezers you\u2019re going to sell, or cars that you\u2019re going to produce, that naturally clouded the amount that you\u2019re going to put in the hedge book,\u201d said analyst Oliver Nugent at Citi.  LME copper volumes rose by 5% in September, benefiting from some speculative buying, while overall volumes slumped by 26%.  The closure of the LME open-outcry ring plus the build-up of inventories in non-LME warehouses may have also contributed to overall weaker LME volumes, analysts and traders said.

People walk by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Global Markets headquarters building in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., September 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Michael Hirtzer  The exchange, which owns the lucrative volatility index the VIX .VIX, has taken several steps to confront manipulation claims that have helped drive the Cboe's stock down about 15 percent this year, putting it on pace for its worst year ever.  In its latest effort to police trading tied to the index, the Cboe is working with FINRA, its regulatory services provider, to develop machine learning techniques to tell whether market conditions surrounding the VIX settlement are potentially anomalous, the exchange told Reuters.  \u201cIncorporating the use of machine learning and AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a logical part of the ongoing enhancement of our overall regulatory program,\u201d Greg Hoogasian, Cboe chief regulatory officer, said in an emailed statement.  Cboe declined to elaborate on when it began using machine learning techniques to monitor VIX settlements.  Any steps, however, may take a while to change investors\u2019 minds on the stock.  \u201cAny time you see controversy over manipulating markets and it involves a company, there are people who will walk away from the stock,\u201d said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.  \u201cIt ends up tarnishing the company and subjecting them to legal risk that is very hard to quantify,\u201d he said.  Tuz said Chase Investment Counsel, which owned nearly 19,000 Cboe shares in mid-2017, began selling its stake early this year, shedding the last of it on May 21.  Cboe's stock performance this year has lagged that of other major exchange operators. Shares of Nasdaq Inc NDAQ.O are up about 17 percent, Intercontinental Exchange Inc's ICE.N is up about 10 percent and CME Group Inc CME.O shares have risen 18 percent.  Concerns the index was being manipulated surfaced last year after John Griffin and Amin Shams of the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas, Austin wrote an academic paper that noted significant spikes in trading volume in S&P 500 index options right at the time of settlement.  The paper also compared the value of the VIX at settlement with its value as calculated from S&P 500 options right after the settlement, and showed the two tend to diverge.  Instances of big deviations are taken as evidence by some that unscrupulous traders have been deliberately moving the settlement price.  A stock market fall on Feb. 5 that caused the VIX to surge the most in its 25-year history brought further scrutiny to the index, and led to dozens of lawsuits and ongoing probes into the matter by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The regulators have yet to comment on the matter and Cboe has denied the manipulation accusations, citing liquidity problems and legitimate hedging activity as reasons for unusual moves on settlement days.  \u201cOnly a forensic analysis of those episodes can confirm or refute such a claim,\u201d said Kambiz Kazemi, partner at Canadian investment management firm La Financi\u00e8re Constance.  Meanwhile, the steps Cboe has taken to address the claims of manipulation are going in the right direction, said Kazemi.  The exchange operator recently overhauled the technology behind the auctions, improved the speed with which it sends alerts about auction imbalances, and sought to increase the number of market makers that provide buy and sell quotes for the auction.  POLICING THE FEAR GAUGE  Orderly VIX settlement auctions over the last few months have helped take some of the pressure off the Chicago-based exchange operator.  \u201cI think we all will be observing the effects of the Cboe measures in the next few months,\u201d Kazemi said.  VIX and associated products accounted for roughly a quarter of Cboe\u2019s 2017 earnings, analysts estimate, and the controversy around the product has spooked some stockholders.  While financial firms have been using artificial intelligence software for everything from compliance to stock-picking, a growing number of firms have started to use it for market oversight.  Given the huge amount of data involved in market surveillance, machine learning algorithms can be far more efficient than humans in rooting out potential market manipulation, said Richard Johnson, a market structure and technology consultant at Greenwich Associates.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a must have,\u201d he said.  FINRA, which already monitors Cboe\u2019s market on the company\u2019s behalf, confirmed it was working on machine learning to enhance surveillance of the VIX settlement auctions, but would not offer specifics.  More generally, the Wall Street watchdog is working to use artificial intelligence to catch nefarious activities more quickly, including schemes that may have previously been unknown to regulators, said Tom Gira, who oversees FINRA\u2019s market regulation department.  He said FINRA has begun using machine learning to scan for illegal activities across stock and options exchanges and is in the process of adding a feedback loop to the software that would regularly incorporate analysts\u2019 data and allow the machines to detect ever-changing manipulation patterns.","183":"SINGAPORE, Feb 4 (Reuters) - London copper prices slid for a second session on Monday with the market under pressure from concerns over slowing factory activity in China - the world\u2019s top industrial metals consumer.

The move followed the EU not extending stock market equivalence to Switzerland after Brussels grew frustrated with Swiss foot-dragging over the long-discussed agreement.  Bern said in response it would withdraw recognition from trading venues in the EU from July 1 to \u201cprotect the Swiss stock exchange infrastructure in the event of non-extension\u201d.  \u201cTrading venues in the EU would thus be prohibited from offering or facilitating trading in certain shares of Swiss companies from that date,\u201d the Swiss government said in a statement.  The EU refrained from extending stock market equivalence, due to expire at the end of June, because the Swiss did not endorse a partnership treaty with the EU that had been negotiated for years, a diplomat told Reuters on Friday.  Granting stock market equivalence is the EU\u2019s major leverage in trying to get the Swiss to finally sign off on an agreement governing ties, but Switzerland\u2019s foreign minister has said repeatedly that Bern will not be rushed into any deal although it remains open for talks.  Bern\u2019s request this month for \u201cclarifications\u201d on three areas - protecting wages, regulating state aid and defining the rights of EU citizens in Switzerland -- is seen in Brussels as demands to reopen the treaty text, which the EU refuses to do.

CHICAGO, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Options exchange operator Miami International Holdings (MIH) will acquire the 139-year-old Minneapolis Grain Exchange, the last independent U.S. grain exchange, the organizations said in a statement on Friday.  Best known for its flagship hard red spring wheat futures contracts, the MGEX, founded as the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce in 1881, will become a wholly owned subsidiary of MIH, pending approval by MGEX membership and regulators. The deal is expected to close late this year.  The MGEX spring wheat futures market is smaller and far less liquid than the global benchmark, Chicago Board of Trade soft red winter wheat futures, operated by CME Group. Open interest in MGEX spring wheat futures totaled 81,136 contracts as of Thursday, compared with 405,834 contracts for CBOT wheat.  MGEX shuttered its open-outcry futures trading pits in 2008, converting to fully electronic trade, although the exchange continued open-outcry trade in spring wheat options.  Yet the member-owned MGEX maintained its independence even after the CME Group bought the Kansas City Board of Trade, another wheat futures exchange, in 2012, and the Intercontinental Exchange Inc snapped up Canada\u2019s Winnipeg Commodity Exchange in 2007.  MIH will maintain trading and clearing operations of the spring wheat contract while adding new futures products.  \u201cMIH remains committed to maintaining and preserving MGEX\u2019s heritage and existing operations, including with respect to the hard red spring wheat contracts,\u201d MIH Chief Executive Officer Thomas Gallagher said in Friday\u2019s statement.  Acquiring the Minneapolis exchange will allow MIH to clear its own products, a factor that made the MGEX attractive, said Austin Damiani, an independent trader and MGEX member.  \u201cThe regulatory barriers established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act ... substantially increased the value of the MGEX as it made the establishment of a new exchange nearly impossible,\u201d Damiani said.

CME, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade, said average rate per contract fell 3.4 percent to $0.706 in the first quarter ended March 31.  \u201cRate per contract fell because there were higher volumes on lower priced products such as interest rate products,\u201d said Sandler O\u2019Neill analyst Richard Repetto.

The promise of unlimited stimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday sent gold prices soaring, but London\u2019s spot market has started lagging behind prices on the Comex futures exchange in New York.  At 1516 GMT, spot gold was up 3% at around $1,600 an ounce, while March futures on the Comex exchange were up nearly 5% at $1,642 an ounce - a price difference of $42.  These prices normally trade within a few dollars of one another. At one stage on Tuesday the difference was more than $70. On Monday, it was around $15.  The higher New York price reflected the perceived cost of taking metal from London to deliver against Comex futures contracts in the United States, traders and bankers said.  London is home to thousands of tonnes of gold which underpin the world\u2019s largest hub for physical gold trading.  But if physical gold from London is needed to deliver against Comex futures contracts it has to be melted down from the 400 ounce bars used in London and recast as 100 ounce bars accepted by Comex.  This has suddenly become more difficult as governments restrict movement of people and goods and after three major metals refineries in Switzerland suspended operations on Monday.  \u201cPeople are worried about whether they can get the gold to deliver into the futures contracts,\u201d said a bullion banker.  The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), which oversees the London trade, said price volatility in New York had impacted liquidity in London and it had \u201coffered its support to CME Group to facilitate physical delivery in New York.\u201d  CME Group operates the Comex exchange.  Liquidity on spot gold and the contract used to bridge the London and New York prices - known as an exchange-for-physical (EFP) contract - was in short supply, traders said.  The spread between offered buy and sell prices for spot gold - normally below 50 cents - also rose to as high as $50 on some trading platforms run by banks and brokers on Tuesday, traders said.  One banker said this was in part because trading systems factored the price of the EFP contract into the spread between bids and offers.  The difference between spot prices and U.S. futures was likely to remain in place until either refineries reopened and transport resumed or Comex changed its rules to allow 400 ounce bars to be used to settle its contracts, said a banker at a major gold-trading bank.  \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of gold,\u201d the banker said. \u201cBut it\u2019s immobilized.\u201d","190":"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday, led by NEX Group as it jumped after a takeover offer, but stocks ended the week with a slight loss as worries about a trade war and geopolitical tensions kept investors on edge.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)  * Global copper trading by exchange in 2020: tmsnrt.rs\/38RSqC7  * LME monthly volumes 2020: tmsnrt.rs\/2KvPVfG  * LME volumes by major contract: tmsnrt.rs\/39G3Ms9  LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - China has led the industrial recovery from COVID-19 with the rest of the world struggling to catch up.  Manufacturing activity has rebounded faster than anywhere else and China\u2019s imports of metals such as copper and aluminium have been running at record highs.  The divergence with the rest of the world is also clear in last year\u2019s global base metals trading patterns.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) saw volumes surge as industrial activity bounced back from early-year lockdowns. Trading action on the London Metal Exchange (LME), by contrast, fell hard over the second half of the year causing full-year volumes to drop 7%.  It was the second consecutive year of decline for the 144-year old London market after a 2% fall in 2019, but the grand old dame of metals trading is winning share in new markets such as steel.  More new LME contracts are expected and the volumes battle between London, Shanghai and the CME in the United States looks set to intensify this year.  TRADING THE COVID-19 RECOVERY  Global metals trading last year ebbed and flowed with the spread of the novel coronavirus.  Copper, one of the most actively traded industrial metals, highlights the disconnect between China and everywhere else.  Shanghai copper volumes fell heavily in the first quarter of 2020, when China went into lockdown, but grew rapidly over the second half of the year, by the end of which they were up by 57% on 2019 levels and the highest since 2016.  Copper action on both the LME and the CME followed an inverse pattern, up strongly in the first quarter before slumping in the second as lockdowns spread to the rest of the world. Volumes remained humdrum over the second half of the year, even while the ShFE saw a surge of activity as Chinese investors bought into the country\u2019s recovery story.  LME copper volumes fell by 2% over 2020, while those on the CME were up by just 0.3%.  It is clear that copper\u2019s recovery from $4,371 per tonne in March to over $8,000 has been largely made and traded in China.  This desynchronised trading pattern played out across the metallic spectrum.  All the ShFE metals contracts recorded strong volume growth last year with the exception of zinc (down 15%) and steel rebar (down 21%).  The stand-out was the Shanghai tin contract, which saw activity mushroom to 13.3 million lots from 3.2 million in 2019, suggesting the tiny tin market has moved onto the broader investment radar in China.  PRICES UP BUT VOLUMES DOWN ON LME  LME volumes jumped in the first quarter of 2020 before registering ever steeper year-on-year falls over the second half.  Average daily volumes in December were down by 20.5% on last year, not including UNA trades, a compliance work-around whose popularity has dwindled since the exchange stopped making it a free service.  The sharp drop-off in trading activity over the second half of 2020 coincided with the super-charged rally in base metal prices, suggesting a collective lack of buy-in from industrial players in what remains their primary hedging forum.  This is not surprising, given the disruptive effect on the manufacturing sector outside China from second and third wave COVID-19 outbreaks and associated lockdowns.  Over the full year only two of the LME\u2019s established contracts - steel rebar and aluminium - registered any increase in volumes and then only a small 4% and 1% respectively.  The sharpest drops were seen in the two aluminium alloy contracts, a niche market that looks in danger of disappearing altogether as activity and registered stocks spiral lower.  However, last year wasn\u2019t all bad news for the LME.  The exchange\u2019s creep into the steel sector continued apace The new China hot-rolled-coil (HRC) contract fared particularly well in its first full year of trading with volumes of 93,514 contracts, up from 38,090 in 2019.  The LME will launch three more steel contracts in June this year for the European HRC market and the Indian and Taiwanese scrap markets.  So far at least, the LME\u2019s incursions into ferrous trading haven\u2019t been at the expense of the CME. Volumes on the U.S. exchange\u2019s HRC contract rose by 27% last year, while activity on its scrap contract more than doubled, suggesting a mutually-beneficial arbitrage link.  EXCHANGE BATTLE HEATS UP  In other parts of the industrial metal markets, however, exchange trading is becoming more fractured.  Aluminium premium trading, for example, seems to have found its home on the CME, which registered volume growth across all four regional products last year.  The LME\u2019s belated attempt to muscle in has so yielded little with its U.S. premium contract notching up just 368 lots in its first full year of trading. The exchange is undeterred with a new contract for European premiums also due in June.  Electric vehicle metals look set to be the next battle-ground for the two exchanges.  The CME launched a cobalt contract in December in what looks like a direct challenge to the LME for trading this battery metal. Volumes in the LME\u2019s physically-deliverable cobalt contract slumped by 86% to just 1,331 contracts, while the newer cash-settled contract did not trade last year.  An LME lithium contract, also due in June this year, opens up a new front in the battle, although it remains to be seen if the exchange has won over the lithium supply chain to the concept of benchmark futures pricing.  Looming ever larger in this fight for metals market share is the ShFE.  Its new \u201cinternational\u201d copper contract, deliverable against metal sitting in Shanghai\u2019s bonded warehouse zone, is traded on ShFE subsidiary the International Energy Exchange.  Trading began in November and grew to 476,334 lots in December with open interest almost doubling to 20,809 lots at the end of the month.  Whether ShFE\u2019s move to step out of the Chinese mainland market into international waters is disruptive or complementary to the LME and CME remains to be seen.  At the very least, the new copper contract seems likely to emerge as a regional pricing hub, creating a further fracturing of what was once an LME-dominant metals trading landscape.","193":"SINGAPORE, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Shanghai copper prices edged up on Monday amid signs of progress in the U.S.-China trade talks, but gains were limited as the markets remained cautious about the prospects of a durable deal.  The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 0.2% to a two-week high of 47,030 yuan ($6,643.69) a tonne by 0148 GMT, while three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was almost unchanged at $5,794 a tonne.  U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday outlined the first phase of a deal to end a trade war with China and suspended a threatened tariff hike on Oct. 15, but existing tariffs remain in place and officials on both sides said much more work is needed before an accord could be agreed.

FILE PHOTO: Four thousand U.S. dollars are counted out by a banker counting currency at a bank in Westminster, Colorado November 3, 2009. REUTERS\/Rick Wilking\/File Photo  The Financial Stability Board (FSB) proposed on Sunday a more detailed checklist for regulators to assess whether clearers hold enough funds to deal with big losses, and asks whether there are still gaps to plug.  The FSB coordinates financial rules for the Group of 20 leading economies (G20), which commit to applying them in national practice. The G20 includes the United States, China, Japan and Germany.  Clearing transactions in the $640 trillion over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market became mandatory after the 2007-09 financial crisis to make trading more transparent.  A clearing house stands between two sides of a financial trade to ensure its completion even if one side goes bust.  Losses beyond certain limits are typically allocated to members, such as banks, and in some cases to their clients.  Mandatory clearing has led to a swelling in clearing houses, with London Stock Exchange\u2019s LCH clearing a record $402 trillion worth of interest rate derivatives in the first quarter.  Such volumes have raised concerns that clearing houses could put taxpayers on the hook in a crisis or have to draw heavily on users such as banks.  DEFAULT FUND  The FSB said regulators should analyse arrangements by which the default fund - the prefunded equity dedicated to cover default losses - and other minimum financial resources would be replenished after covering losses.  Clearers have just gone through extreme market volatility and record volumes without a major hitch as investors sold off in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Markets face further stress as the pandemic is likely to trigger a global recession.  The FSB proposal comes amid a years-long standoff between clearing houses and their customers.  Last month a group of nine global banks and investment management companies, including JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock, Citigroup, Barclays and Deutsche Bank, said clearing houses need to have more of their own capital at risk as an incentive to limit risky trading.  The group also wants a bigger say in how clearing houses are run as they worry they will end up plugging the losses if clearers are not properly resourced.  They argue that the alignment of risk incentives was thrown out of kilter as major clearing houses shifted to being owned by investors instead of by their member users.  CME Group, which operates a derivatives clearing house, has said it is users that bring risk and that they should be putting money into the default funds.  The FSB paper said regulators should consider whether clearing houses should hold liabilities that can be \u201cbailed in\u201d or written down to plug holes from losses, echoing a requirement for global banks since the financial crisis to shield taxpayers.","195":"LONDON (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets CBOE.Z said on Tuesday it would take full control of EuroCCP, Europe's largest clearing house for stock trades, to bolster its post-Brexit base in Amsterdam and diversify into derivatives.  FILE PHOTO: People walk by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Global Markets headquarters building in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., September 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Michael Hirtzer  It is the latest deal in a rapidly consolidating market where the Swiss Exchange has bid for its Madrid counterpart and the London Stock Exchange LSE.L is buying financial market data company Refinitiv.  Cboe, the biggest pan-European share trading platform, already owns 20% of EuroCCP.  It is buying out the four 20% stakes held by exchanges Euronext ENX.PA and Nasdaq NDAQ.O, Dutch bank ABN Amro ABNd.AS and The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).  Chicago-headquartered Cboe said it was paying cash but declined to say how much.  Euronext said it would receive net proceeds of 9 million euros, indicating Cboe paid roughly 36 million in total.  The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2020 after regulatory approvals have been received.  The combination of Europe\u2019s biggest share trading platform and equities clearing house could raise concerns among users that a \u201cvertical silo\u201d is being built to squeeze higher fees out of them.  \u201cOur plan is not to recreate the vertical silo and pull up the drawbridge and issue price rises once a year without speaking to customers,\u201d said David Howson, chief operating officer of Cboe Europe.  It would be up to Cboe customers where they want to clear trades, he added.  Cboe wants to ramp up trading and clearing in equity futures and options by investing an undisclosed sum that will dilute earnings for the next three to four years, Howson said.  Euronext also wants to expand equity derivatives trading. It said on Tuesday it would look to do this through its 11.1% stake in LCH SA, the Paris unit of LCH, the world\u2019s biggest derivatives clearing house, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange.  EuroCCP CEO Cecile Nagel said the company was making money but looking for a \u201cstep change\u201d in strategy, which was difficult with five shareholders.  Cboe, which runs a pan-European share trading platform in London, has opened a subsidiary in Amsterdam ahead of Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union next month.  \u201cIf we leave on January 31, beyond that we will be looking to see how we encourage further trading through the venue,\u201d Howson said.  EuroCCP\u2019s base in Amsterdam was a consideration in the acquisition due to Brexit, he said.  Being based inside the EU puts the Cboe-EuroCCP combination in a \u201cvery good place\u201d if the bloc sought to limit trading of euro denominated shares in London, or made it harder for non-EU clearing houses to serve EU customers, Howson said.  The EU is likely to welcome consolidation that helps make its capital market more efficient and reduce reliance on London, even if it is being driven by a U.S. exchange.","196":"LONDON (Reuters) - When bitcoin was born it was a symbol of counterculture, a rebel currency with near-anonymity and a lack of regulation. A decade later, there are growing signs it\u2019s entering the establishment its creators sought to subvert.  FILE PHOTO: An electric board showing exchange rate between South Korean Won and Bitcoin at a cryptocurrencies exchange in Seoul, South Korea December 13, 2017. REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji\/File Photo  As the cryptocurrency has surged in value bigger investors, from trading firms to hedge funds, have increasingly turned to exchanges regulated in traditional financial centers. They are buying bitcoin futures to gain exposure to the asset while avoiding the hacks and heists that plague the industry.  The crypto market, associated by many with the dark web, money laundering and the Wild West, is beginning to be discussed by financiers in the same breath as derivatives, hedging instruments and compliance.  Investors plowed record levels of money into bitcoin futures at regulated exchanges in the United States and Britain last month, hungry for a piece of the action but seeking the kind of protection that will satisfy their compliance officers.  Between March and May, bitcoin more than doubled in price, an ascent peppered by double-digit price swings reminiscent of its 2017 bubble, which was driven by smaller retail investors.  During that period, Chicago-based CME Group Inc\u2019s average daily volumes of futures contracts climbed over seven-fold to a record $508 million in May. The number of open interest contracts - those that haven\u2019t been settled - also hit a record.  CME said bitcoin\u2019s price gains, and the subsequent increase in volatility, attracted new investors seeking to hedge risk.  Crypto Facilities, a London-registered platform bought this year for over $100 million by major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, said bitcoin futures daily trading volumes jumped over three-fold from March to a record $84 million in May.  In a sign of the growing mainstream market, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE), plans to offer bitcoin futures in the coming months through a new crypto-trading platform, Bakkt.  \u201cIt\u2019s logical they (institutional investors) would want to be moving in this direction, especially considering their size and how much more there is at stake,\u201d said Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Exchange Group.  HEDGING INSTRUMENT  Futures - financial contracts that lock buyers and sellers into trading an asset at a set date and price - are seen as key components of any mature market, as they boost market liquidity and allow investors to bet on the direction of prices.  \u201cIt\u2019s a useful hedging instrument,\u201d said Daniel Matuszewski, head of trading at Goldman Sachs-backed crypto firm Circle. \u201cFutures are much easier to trade, much easier to use for hedging, much easier to get leverage on.\u201d  Playing out in the spiking demand is the emergence of a twin-track global bitcoin futures market - on \u201conshore\u201d exchanges like CME and \u201coffshore\u201d exchanges, which are more lightly regulated and still command the bulk of the multi-billion-dollar daily market.  Onshore exchanges - those regulated in established financial centers - are usually subject to strict checks on governance, technology and client vetting. They demand a high degree of transparency.  Offshore platforms, in contrast, are typically registered in jurisdictions with less onerous rules. They tend to accept business from investors who can sign up with few checks on their identity or the provenance of their funds.  Larger investors, bound by strict compliance rules, are heading to regulated platforms in financial hubs like CME, according to industry players. Traders with more tolerance for risk - including retail investors from north Asia and companies earning money in cryptocurrency, from miners to gaming firms - use of offshore exchanges.  \u201cOffshore exchanges aren\u2019t really exchanges - they are more like private markets,\u201d said Vladimir Jelisavcic of trading firm Cherokee Acquisition in New York.  \u2018STARS HAVE ALIGNED\u2019  Offshore exchanges have offered bitcoin futures since as early as 2011. One of the biggest, Seychelles-registered BitMEX, said it now accounts for over 65% of global cryptocurrency derivatives trading. Trading volumes were $4.3 billion in May, it said.  BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes said, however, that larger investors were being increasingly drawn to onshore exchanges like CME.  \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect product (for bigger investors) - it\u2019s U.S.-dollar based, they never have to touch actual bitcoin, it\u2019s financially settled,\u201d he said.  The launch by CME and rival Cboe Global Markets in December 2017 marked the first time mainstream exchanges offered cryptocurrency derivatives.  They initially faced tepid demand. Cboe said in March, when bitcoin languished below $4,000, that it planned to discontinue its futures, with the final contracts expiring this month.  For their part, CME\u2019s futures have typically seen thin liquidity and high barriers to entry for smaller investors, said Ricky Li of crypto trader Altonomy in New York.  The growing gap in the market for futures from onshore exchanges is stimulating growing competition and attracting new entrants, such as ICE.  Sui Chung, head of cryptocurrency pricing products at Crypto Facilities, said compliance-wary institutional investors had been assessing the various futures products offered by regulated exchanges for some time, as they awaited a spike in prices to allow them to enter the market.  \u201cThis is the first time those stars have aligned,\u201d he said.","197":"LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Most banking, insurance and other financial firms in Britain would be cut off from the European Union if there is a no-deal Brexit, the bloc\u2019s executive body said on Wednesday.  Financial services are Britain\u2019s most important tax-earning sector with the EU its biggest customer.  The European Commission set out its contingency plans in the event of Britain crashing out of the bloc next March without securing a divorce settlement and transition period.  \u201cIf the Withdrawal Agreement is not ratified, financial operators established in the United Kingdom will lose, as of the withdrawal date, the right to provide their services in the EU27 member states under the EU financial services passports,\u201d it said in a statement.  Brussels said it was only taking preventive action to ensure EU customers could continue clearing derivatives transactions at UK operators like LCH for a year from March, and use central securities depositories in Britain for two years.  \u201cThe commission has concluded that EU27 companies need this time to have in place fully viable alternatives to UK operators.\u201d  It also gave EU market participants time to shift derivatives contracts from Britain to the EU without being caught up in with margining requirements.  \u201cFor their part, clients in the European Union of UK firms need to prepare for a scenario in which their provider is no longer subject to EU law,\u201d the commission said.  This contrasts with Britain\u2019s decision to offer broad access for banking, insurance and other financial services from EU firms in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The Bank of England wanted EU contingency plans to include legal \u201ccontinuity\u201d of cross-border insurance contracts.  \u201cWhile the action on derivatives is welcome it is extraordinary that the EU authorities will act to help major financial institutions, but not millions of ordinary people living in Europe whose insurance and pension contracts happen to be held in the UK,\u201d said Hugh Savill, director of regulation at the Association of British Insurers.  Catherine McGuinness, leader of the City of London financial district, said the commission also needed to address significant \u201ccliff edge\u201d risks for data transfers and contract continuity for uncleared derivatives.  Markus Ferber, a senior member of the European Parliament\u2019s economic affairs committee, said actions on derivatives will not be enough as the question of legal liability remains unanswered.  \u201cThe European Commission has to disclose the underlying cooperation agreements with UK supervisors. Furthermore it has to answer the question if and up to what level the European Central Bank will have to provide emergency liquidity assistance in a crisis scenario,\u201d Ferber said.  Many financial firms in Britain are pushing ahead to open new hubs in the bloc before March to ensure continuity of services for EU customers, irrespective of what form Brexit takes.

FILE PHOTO: The headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Frankfurt skyline with its financial district are photographed on early evening in Frankfurt, Germany, March 25, 2018. REUTERS\/Kai Pfaffenbach\/File Photo  The bloc has proposed changing the ECB\u2019s statute to give it a broad role in the oversight of EU and foreign clearing houses that handle large amounts of euro-denominated securities. That would include those in London, which will lie outside the EU in five months\u2019 time.  Now the current EU president Austria has proposed fleshing out the role with detailed powers, such as being able to force foreign clearing houses to \u201csubmit information, cooperate in the assessment of their resilience to adverse market conditions, and open overnight deposit accounts\u201d, the document said.  The EU wants the changes approved in time for Britain's departure from the bloc next March. LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange LSE.L, dominates clearing of euro-denominated interest rate swaps and will be outside the EU.  In exceptional situations, the ECB could force a foreign clearing house to comply with temporary requirements on how much margin customers should post to back trades, the level of collateral, and how frequent intraday margins should be collected, tasks normally supervised by the home regulator.  Financial lawyers say this would, for example, give the ECB power to stop a foreign clearing house raising margins on euro-denominated positions in times of market stress.  The ECB has long been concerned that so much euro-denominated trade is already conducted outside the euro zone in London, and appears keen to bring this under its supervision after Brexit.  Some policymakers had wanted to stop a clearing house from increasing margins during the euro zone debt crisis, saying this amplified stress in markets.  The United States is unhappy about the EU plans.  Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission which regulates the American derivatives market, has threatened retaliation against EU financial firms if the bloc does not water down what he sees as overly intrusive proposals affecting U.S. clearers such as CME and ICE.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)  * LME Steel Contracts: tmsnrt.rs\/2D7mQ48  LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - It\u2019s been almost a decade since the iron ore market abandoned the annual benchmark system of pricing.  The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) caused such dislocation between annual and spot prices that even sceptics such as Brazil\u2019s Vale joined the revolution.  Ten years on and the iron ore market is a changed landscape, producers now selling most of their product basis spot, monthly or quarterly prices.  This collective shift towards spot pricing has driven an explosion in iron ore futures trading.  The Singapore Exchange (SGX), which was the first to launch iron ore products in the form of swaps, registered turnover of 17.6 million tonnes in 2010, the first full year of trading.  Last year activity on its core iron ore futures contract exceeded 1.28 billion tonnes and that on its options contract 295 million tonnes.  SGX\u2019s steel swaps and futures, by contrast, haven\u2019t traded at all since the end of 2016 and 2014 respectively.  The revolution in iron ore pricing has largely failed to travel down the steel value chain, producers reluctant to lose their pricing power and fearful that futures trading will open the door to speculative price drivers.  The London Metal Exchange (LME) is betting three new contracts will help change the collective hostility.  Graphic on LME steel contracts\u2019 performance:  tmsnrt.rs\/2D7mQ48  SCRAP SUCCESS  The new index contracts, all for hot rolled coil (HRC), one for each major geographic region, will be launched early next year.  LME officials seem quietly confident that at least one of the new HRC contracts will find traction.  Expectations have been buoyed by the success of the LME\u2019s steel scrap contract, launched in 2015.  Volumes grew from 49,000 contracts in 2016 to 308,000 contracts last year and were up by another 74 percent in the first nine months of this year.  More significantly, open interest hit a fresh high of 13,129 lots at the end of September with positions open up to 15 months forward.  \u201cThe presence of open interest on further dated prompts often suggests that the financial derivatives have been used to hedge physical exposure to the underlying commodity,\u201d according to the LME\u2019s \u201cFerrous Monthly Update\u201d.  The LME\u2019s steel rebar contract has less open interest, just 805 lots at the end of September, but what it does have is also distributed down the futures curve.  Rebar volumes have failed to match those of scrap, suggesting that steel producers are much more willing to use futures markets to hedge inputs such as scrap and iron ore than their outputs such as rebar.  Or hot rolled coil.  Which is why the LME\u2019s new contracts are an interesting gambit.  CHINESE GIANT  The LME is not the first exchange to promote steel product futures.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) launched its rebar contract in 2009 and its HRC contract in 2014.  Both are highly liquid with construction-use rebar popularly traded as a proxy for China\u2019s property sector.  Speculators rule in Shanghai.  And most of them do not hold positions for very long. The ratio of open interest to volume on the Shanghai rebar contract was under five percent at the end of October. That on the LME\u2019s rebar contract is usually well in excess of 20 percent.  If there is industrial hedging activity taking place in Shanghai, it\u2019s hard to discern beneath the ebb and flow of investment money.  Shanghai, moreover, is a domestic Chinese market with little direct pricing impact on steel supply chains in the rest of the world.  US RESURGENCE?  In the United States CME unveiled an HRC contract in 2010 and a steel scrap contract in 2012.  The latter looked in danger of extinction in early 2016 with several months of zero volumes and open interest.  However, this year has seen a transformation with activity surging to 17,087 contracts in January-October from just 1,220 contracts in the same period last year.  Open interest has jumped from 680 contracts to 3,988 over the same time frame.  Given this lift in activity has coincided with the fast growth in the LME\u2019s scrap contract, the inference is that an arbitrage trade between the U.S. Midwest (CME) and the Black Sea (LME) scrap markets is evolving.  The turnaround in the CME\u2019s HRC contract has been less pronounced but after nearly a year of falling activity, trading volumes started growing again around the middle of last year.  In the first 10 months of this year over 2 million tonnes traded, a year-on-year jump of 89 percent.  The mechanics of which contract on which exchange is driving the collective pick-up in trading activity are unclear but it\u2019s a sign that something is starting to stir in the steel pricing world.  NO REVOLUTION  But don\u2019t expect steel producers to stampede into this fledgling futures arena.  This will be no revolution as happened to iron ore, more a gradual creep.  For a start, there are many more steel producers than big iron ore suppliers.  Back in 2009-2010 it took just three iron ore players, Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, to switch pricing and the entire industry switched with them.  Secondly, the break from annual producer-to-consumer prices was accelerated by a totally unexpected event in the form of the GFC and the resulting collapse in iron ore demand.  Faced with yearly contracts locked into higher prices, many iron ore buyers simply walked away.  The GFC shock cruelly exposed the failings of the annual benchmark contract system, triggering a mass move to spot or close-to-spot trading.  Without such a dramatic external driver, steel pricing is more likely to evolve than explode. Producers will continue to resist. Big consumers such as the automotive companies will continue to push for change.  But the apparent liquidity creep from the LME to the CME suggests that some in the steel supply chain are starting to embrace futures pricing.  The LME is betting that more will follow.","200":"(Corrects RIC for Bank of China from to)  BEIJING, April 29 (Reuters) - Bank of China said on Wednesday it had hired lawyers to formally send a letter to CME Group, urging the U.S. exchange operator to investigate reasons behind \u201cabnormal fluctuations\u201d in crude oil futures prices on April 21.

FILE PHOTO: The S&P Global logo is displayed on its offices in the financial district in New York City, U.S., December 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The deal creates a stronger No. 3 in the financial information market by bringing together S&P Global\u2019s expertise in providing debt ratings to countries and companies and data on capital and commodity markets, with IHS\u2019 pricing and reference data for financial assets and derivatives.  Consolidation among financial information services providers is intensifying as companies seek to become one-stop-shops for financial professionals using data to run models and algorithms that influence billions of dollars of capital flows.  The merged company will continue to trail industry leaders Bloomberg LP and Refinitiv - partly owned by Thomson Reuters Corp, the parent of Reuters News - according to market research firm Burton-Taylor.  Suppliers of financial markets data generated $32 billion of revenue in 2019, according to Burton-Taylor. Bloomberg held the largest market share with 32.8%, followed by Refinitiv at 21.4%. S&P generated 6%, and IHS represented 2% of total revenue.  However, the sheer size of the deal will prompt antitrust enforcers to scrutinize the planned merger not only for areas where the companies compete directly, the traditional focus, but also areas where the companies had plans to compete in the future, antitrust experts said.  \u201cI think it\u2019s going to run into really tough scrutiny in the Biden DOJ (Justice Department),\u201d said Seth Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel. \u201cIt would have been better for them if they tried to do this last spring.\u201d  Asked about potential antitrust concerns, Douglas Peterson, CEO of S&P Global, sounded an optimistic note.  \u201cWe don\u2019t believe there\u2019s going to be any regulatory issues which we can\u2019t resolve,\u201d he told Reuters.  In a similar deal involving two huge data providers, London Stock Exchange Group Plc sold Borsa Italiana to help appease European Union regulators\u2019 concerns over its $27 billion deal to buy Refinitiv.  A source familiar with the two companies, speaking on condition of anonymity, said S&P Global may have to divest IHS\u2019 Opis oil price information service because of an overlap with S&P\u2019s competing Platts product. The source said this would not affect the combined firm\u2019s profitability.  The S&P\/IHS deal would likely be investigated by the Justice Department, whose antitrust leadership may not be in place for months. One Biden transition team member said recently in a speech that antitrust enforcement should be toughened. Progressive Democrats have advocated for this.  \u201cAny enormous merger like this in this particular climate is going to get the attention of the enforcement agency, no matter what administration,\u201d said Anna Pletcher of the law firm O\u2019Melveny. But she also noted that other big companies provide data to investors and said she would be surprised if, after any scrutiny, the deal was challenged.

The launch will mark the end of a years-long push by China to create Asia\u2019s first oil futures benchmark, and is aimed at giving the world\u2019s biggest oil importer more clout in pricing crude in Asia.  It will potentially give the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), which will operate the new contract, a share of the trillions of dollars each year in oil futures trading.  The two sources declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) and INE, which is part of the ShFE, declined to comment. The country\u2019s securities regulator, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), did not respond to a request for comment.  Asia has become the world\u2019s biggest oil consumer, and China hopes its own derivative crude contract will better reflect market conditions in the region.  Most oil trades are priced off two crude derivatives, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and London\u2019s Brent, and executed mainly on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) owned by CME Group and the Intercontinental Exchange .  The creation of the yuan-denominated contract, which will be open to Chinese and overseas investors, was originally expected about six years ago, but has run into delays as turmoil in China\u2019s stock markets and other commodity futures raised concerns about its capacity to handle financial turbulence.  The proposal was put on the backburner early last year.

The Hong Kong exchange said it would now hold more talks with LSE investors as it considers its next step, aiming to keep alive its hopes of becoming a more global player to rival U.S. giants ICE ICE.N and CME CME.O.  \u201cHKEX believes that shareholders in LSEG should have the opportunity to analyze in detail both transactions and will continue to engage with them,\u201d it said in a statement.  The LSE said earlier on Friday, as it rebuffed the Hong Kong approach, that it was sticking with its $27 billion acquisition of data and analytics company Refinitiv - a deal that the HKEX offer had required the London exchange to abandon.  It told HKEX in a letter that it had fundamental concerns about key aspects of its takeover proposal which it said had no strategic merit, and that HKEX\u2019s relationship with the Hong Kong government would \u201ccomplicate matters\u201d.  HKEX\u2019s valuation of the LSE falls \u201csubstantially short\u201d and the \u201congoing situation in Hong Kong\u201d adds to uncertainty for shareholders, the London bourse added, a reference to weeks of pro-democracy street protests in the former British colony.  \u201cAccordingly, the board unanimously rejects the conditional proposal and, given its fundamental flaws, sees no merit in further engagement,\u201d the LSE said in a statement.  HKEX, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing 0388.HK, said it was disappointed the LSE has refused to \"properly engage\" in a compelling proposal.  A source close to HKEX added the quick dismissal of the surprise offer, announced on Wednesday, meant the Hong Kong bourse had very little time to discuss their proposal with investors, a sentiment echoed by some shareholders.  \u201cAs shareholders in LSE, it\u2019s difficult to evaluate the merits of a combination with HKEX as we have been given no information on potential synergies,\u201d said James Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA, which holds a small stake.  LSE shares, however, rose on the news of the offer rejection and closed up 2.73% at 7,450 pence.  LSE\u2019s blunt rejection letter said the Hong Kong offer did not meet its strategic objectives. It said it was sticking with its core strategy of expanding into data with the Refinitiv deal, rather than taking a \u201csignificant backward step\u201d by bulking up on market transactions in the HKEX proposal.  The LSE also said a Hong Kong takeover could well be rejected by regulators or governments in Britain, the United States and Italy. HKEX\u2019s assertion that implementing the deal would be swift and certain \u201cis simply not credible\u201d, it added.  The LSE also owns the Milan exchange and has a significant American presence through its FTSE Russell index subsidiary and LCH, its derivatives clearing house which dominates the U.S. dollar swap market.  HKEX added on Friday that it had held initial constructive discussions with regulators and policymakers. But a regulatory source in Britain said no substantive discussions had been held on the proposed deal so far.  HIGHER OR HOSTILE?  The flat rejection indicates HKEX boss Charles Li is unlikely to win the LSE board round with an improved financial offer, meaning he may have to go hostile if he wants to persist. He would need to launch a major charm offensive with investors to convince them the LSE board is wrong.  However a source close to the LSE said even if the cash component of HKEX\u2019s cash-and shares offer was raised, it would increase the risk for a combined group by piling on more leverage.  The source said a higher bid by the Hong Kong exchange or going hostile was unlikely to succeed because its proposal was \u201cjust too weak on every fundamental point\u201d.  A deal will be also challenging given the troubled history of big exchange mergers, combined with Hong Kong\u2019s current unrest.  The industry has been littered with attempts at cross-border tie-ups for over a decade as profits from the traditional business of running stock markets and clearing houses have fallen. But proposed deals have collapsed in the face of regulatory and political opposition to core parts of a country\u2019s financial system falling into foreign hands.  FILE PHOTO: Signage is seen outside the entrance of the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain. Aug 23, 2018. REUTERS\/Peter Nicholls\/File Photo  This has pushed exchanges to look for related businesses for growth, with the likes of LSE and New York Stock Exchange owner ICE driving into more profitable and less politically sensitive areas like data and analytics, where revenue is rising.  \u201cThis (rejection) certainly makes it clear that even if the HK exchange were to reconsider the terms of the transaction, it shows fundamentally the LSE board would prefer to go down the Refinitiv route,\u201d said Michael Werner, analyst at UBS.  HKEX made its offer just two days after its officials traveled to London to present it to LSE Chief Executive David Schwimmer for the first time. It has been coolly received by shareholders on both sides so far.  PROTESTS AND POLITICS  Analysts said a perception that Beijing is exerting growing influence over Hong Kong was a key sticking point for an LSE takeover, given the Hong Kong government\u2019s close links with the HKEX. The Hong Kong government is the biggest shareholder in HKEX, with a 6% stake and approves six of the 13 board members.  Hong Kong is entering a fourth month of sometimes violent protests sparked by legislation that would have drawn the former British colony closer to the Chinese legal system.  Fitch Ratings said, before the LSE\u2019s rejection of the offer, that \u201cincreasing control by Chinese authorities over Hong Kong\u201d could raise regulatory concerns in Britain and the United States about data and information security.  HKEX, for its part, had touted the deal as providing London with a major gateway to the Chinese economy, but the LSE said HKEX did not provide the best long-term option.  \u201cWe value our mutually beneficial partnership with the Shanghai Stock Exchange which is our preferred and direct channel to access the many opportunities with China,\u201d the LSE said.  The LSE and Shanghai have recently launched a share trading link.  Earlier on Friday, ahead of the rejection, HKEX boss Li told Reuters that his proposal was one about boosting the long-term fortunes of both exchanges.  \u201cWhoever can come up with a system that either allows money to go into China or allow the Chinese money to come out is going to really, really transform global financial markets.\u201d","207":"LONDON, April 7 (Reuters) - Stocks of gold held in vaults in New York registered with CME Group\u2019s Comex exchange have jumped to 15.9 million ounces, the most since at least 2002, as a large price premium sucks bullion to the city.  Gold futures on Comex leaped above London spot prices two weeks ago after coronavirus control measures shut down air travel and several major precious metals refineries.  Traders feared it would be impossible to ship gold from London, a major storage centre, to settle contract obligations in New York, where much more gold trades than is stored.  Higher prices create an incentive to move metal, and the stockpile in Comex-registered vaults has surged to 15.9 million ounces -- worth some $26 billion -- from 11 million ounces at the end of last week and less than 9 million ounces two weeks ago, CME data showed.  The most-traded gold contract on Comex remained around $50 -- or 3% -- higher than London spot gold on Tuesday, suggesting that despite the partial reopening of three large refineries in Switzerland, worries over supply remain.  That contract has a June delivery date, and there are currently 357,369 contracts active representing 35.7 million ounces of gold.  Investors on Comex typically want exposure to gold prices and do not request delivery of metal, instead rolling their positions to future months.  Of around 200,000 contracts for April delivery active on March 23, when prices on Comex began to rise sharply above spot gold, around 25,000 equivalent to 2.5 million ounces have been taken to delivery, according to CME data.","208":"The London Stock Exchange Group offices are seen in the City of London, Britain, December 29, 2017.  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - David Schwimmer is making a bold break for independence. Almost exactly a year since he took charge of the London Stock Exchange Group, the former Goldman Sachs investment banker is hoping to finalise a $27 billion takeover of financial data provider Refinitiv. It\u2019s a complex and highly leveraged attempt by the perennial takeover target to turn itself into a buyer instead.  The deal in the works, confirmed by the LSE on Saturday, required the alignment of financial stars. Thanks to a share price surge which has boosted its equity value by a quarter since October, LSE is now worth almost exactly as much, including debt, as it is proposing to pay for Refinitiv. But the target is burdened with borrowings of more than $12 billion, the result of last year\u2019s partial buyout by a Blackstone-led consortium from Thomson Reuters, owner of Breakingviews. That capital structure enables the LSE to pay Refinitiv\u2019s owners with shares worth less than $15 billion, giving them 37% of the enlarged UK company.  The transaction ticks three boxes for the LSE. First, it opens new growth opportunities in the interpretation and analysis of financial data - an area Schwimmer had earmarked for expansion. Second, it reduces the company\u2019s dependence on stock market indexes and trades. These businesses have delivered much of the LSE\u2019s recent growth, but face pressure from cost-conscious fund managers and European regulators. Finally, Refinitiv dilutes the LSE\u2019s exposure to the United Kingdom amid the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.  Yet the deal comes with substantial risks. The two companies\u2019 net debt at the end of 2018 was more than four times last year\u2019s combined EBITDA, Breakingviews calculates, after stripping out some one-off Refinitiv expenses. Bringing that ratio down depends on cost-cutting. Refinitiv\u2019s private equity owners reckon they will produce savings of $650 million a year by the end of 2020, and Schwimmer has then pledged to slice a further $430 million or so off annual expenses, while integrating a much larger workforce. Refinitiv\u2019s 18,500 employees outnumber the LSE\u2019s by roughly four to one.  The short-term risk is that an interloper offers more for Refinitiv, or that a rival like Intercontinental Exchange or CME pounces on the LSE before its shareholders approve the deal. Longer term, the chief executive\u2019s challenge will be proving that becoming a predator is as lucrative for investors as being potential prey.","209":"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia\u2019s booming liquefied natural gas (LNG) market has seen exchanges and commodity price agencies vie to become the region\u2019s leading price benchmark.  FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: A liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker is tugged towards a thermal power station in Futtsu, east of Tokyo, Japan, November 13, 2017. REUTERS\/Issei Kato\/File Photo\/File Photo\/File Photo  That race seems over with S&P Global Platts emerging the winner, over rivals including other price reporting agencies and exchanges.  With over 70 percent of global LNG consumed in Asia, and growth concentrated in this region, it adds a potentially lucrative business to the company\u2019s already profitable operations providing oil price assessments.  Platts SPGI.N says LNG swaps volumes, settled against its Japan Korea Marker (JKM) LNG price assessments, quadrupled in 2017 to 50,266 lots, equivalent to around 170 tankers of LNG and the growth has continued this year.  \u201cJanuary 2018 was a record month for JKM derivatives with over 9,500 lots cleared, equivalent to over 31 standard-sized LNG cargoes,\u201d said Dave Ernsberger, head of energy pricing at S&P Global Platts.  Platts provides price assessments of spot LNG cargoes traded in Asia and analysts and traders estimate the vast majority of deals are priced using its benchmark.  The Intercontinental Exchange ICE.N, which operates financial and commodities markets, also provides a swaps contract for LNG that uses the Platts benchmark as the price for the underlying asset. More than 9,000 LNG lots were traded in January. Each lot is over 10,000 million British thermal units (mmBtu).  \u201cThe contract is increasingly seen as the benchmark... for LNG in Asia,\u201d Gordon Bennett, managing director of utility markets at ICE, said in a client note.  The CME Group CME.O, which operates derivatives markets, has a similar arrangement, although only 265 lots were traded in January on its platform.  Early starter advantage - Platts started its JKM in 2009 \u2013 and the tie-up with ICE seems to have won Platts the race to be the main supplier of the price marker in Asia, creating critical liquidity that is crucial for any market to develop, according to several senior traders.  Other price reporting agencies and exchanges, including Japan's Tokyo Commodity Exchange (Tocom) and the Singapore Exchange SGXL.SI, have vied for a slice of the price-assessment pie but have struggled for significant market share.  TOCOM declined to comment, while SGX said there was \u201cstrong interest\u201d in its Middle East and India LNG derivatives contract, known as the Dubai\/Kuwait\/India.  A sudden growth in spot trading of LNG in Asia has also been fortuitous for Platts.  Most LNG is traded via multi-year supply contracts, but spot trading took off from 2016 and made the need for a price assessment to settle trades more urgent.  China\u2019s imports rose rapidly and some newer suppliers to the market were willing to break with traditional long-term supply contracts and provide spot cargoes instead.  \"Flexible volumes from the U.S. and new supplies from Australia, Papua New Guinea and Africa increased the number of spot transactions,\" said U.S. LNG firm Tellurian TELL.O in a note to clients this month.  \u201cThe number of participants... increased to around 45, compared with 20-30 at the start if 2017,\u201d Tellurian said.  LIQUIDITY ATTRACTS LIQUIDITY  The increased liquidity will fuel further volumes of trading activity, people in the market say.  \u201cThe ability to enter and more importantly exit trades is critical when trading in financial markets,\u201d said Tobias Davis, head of LNG-Asia at brokerage Tullett Prebon, which also facilitates trade in JKM swaps.  \u201cAs the JKM benchmark has become more widely adopted, liquidity in the paper (swaps) market has grown exponentially,\u201d he added.  China\u2019s surge in demand has ironically left the JKM, named after the dominant LNG importers when it was launched, somewhat misnamed given China\u2019s rise.  While Japan remains the world\u2019s biggest LNG importer, China overtook South Korea to become the No.2 buyer last year, and most analysts say it is only a matter of time before China surpasses Japan.  Most traders say Platts\u2019 current success is based on the link between its price assessments and the swaps trading on ICE.  But if history is a guide, the assessments could lose favor over time as the Asia market develops, Saul Kavonic, principal analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, argues.  \u201cIf and when a true Asian LNG trading hub and platform evolves, then price discovery will move toward being based on an exchange, and futures will move to exchange-based derivatives contracts, as we\u2019ve seen in Europe and North America where exchange prices like the U.S. Henry Hub or Britain\u2019s National Balance Point, not Platts, dominate the market,\u201d he said.  Australian energy and mining giant BHP BHP.AX said this week in its annual outlook that a future global gas market would be \"potentially harmonized around the Henry Hub\" as U.S. producers export LNG based on this benchmark.

Dealing activity in copper - the metal widely regarded as an economic barometer of the global economy due to its industrial uses - has withered in the West and analysts expect it to remain weak after sharp swings on the market.  The CME Group, favoured by funds and other speculators, was hardest hit, with trading volumes in Comex copper futures and options plummeting 40% to 1.26 million contracts in May compared to last year.  The larger London Metal Exchange, the main venue for physical business from miners and industrial users, saw volumes slide 26% to 2.12 million lots last month, according to data from the exchanges.  \u201cMany people were hurt on the downside and hurt on the upside as well,\u201d said Gabriel Garcin, portfolio specialist of alternative and traditional investments at UBS in Paris.  \u201cNow you end up today with less leveraged market participants who are not really willing to take huge amounts of new directional risk on these markets.\u201d  Open interest - measuring the flow of money that remains in a contract - in CME\u2019s Comex copper futures stands at the lowest levels since 2016.  Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at commodities broker Marex Spectron, said there had been derisking across quantitative strategies.  Banks, mainly in the West, have formulated \u201crisk premia\u201d products for institutional investors that seek to boost returns using alternative assets such as commodities.  Speculators piled in with bearish positions as COVID-19 lockdowns cut demand for metals, pushing benchmark copper prices on the LME to a 45-month low of $4,371 a tonne on March 19.  Prices have since rebounded by about a third to around $5,800, but volumes and open interest have remained subdued.  Volumes were high in March across metals exchanges, surging 31.6% on Comex and 18% on the LME, reflecting increased bearish bets and withdrawal of participants.  In China, however, copper volumes have been robust, surging 21% on the Shanghai Futures Exchange in May after a 38% jump in April.  That reflects the fact that ShFE attracts a lot of small retail speculators, which have persisted in their trades, as well as increasing numbers of industrial players.  \u201cHedging activity for example is not as common yet in China so there is more room for growth of new participants,\u201d an Asia-based trader said, adding that bargain hunters were also out in force in April.

The EU has just approved a law requiring its regulators to categorize foreign clearing houses according to risks posed to the EU financial stability if they went bust.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) commissioner Brian Quintenz said the proposal was not a tit-for-tat to the EU reform, which prompted U.S. accusations of regulatory overreach.  \u201cIt\u2019s setting within a policy framework what we already do on an operational basis,\u201d Quintenz told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in London.  The CFTC currently grants exemptions to smaller foreign clearing houses from onerous U.S. rules on the basis they are being properly supervised by their home regulator. Larger clearers must register with the CFTC.  \u201cThis is an effort to put that in a regulatory framework,\u201d Quintenz said.  The new framework would define what posing a \u201csubstantial risk to the United States\u201d means in practical terms, such as by measuring how much of a clearer\u2019s activity can be traced back to a U.S. entity, Quintenz said.  \u201cMy expectation is that it won\u2019t change the impact on any registered entity,\u201d he added.  But clearing houses that currently operate under an exemption may want to be registered under the new framework to get a CFTC \u201cstamp\u201d to reassure clients, Quintenz said.  In the EU, systemically important clearers must undergo close scrutiny by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in their home country if they want to serve customers in the bloc.  It was prompted by the prospect London-based LCH, Europe\u2019s biggest clearing house, being outside the bloc and EU supervision after Brexit.  LCH clears the bulk of interest rate swaps traded in the EU.  \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a formal structure out there in public as a contrast to what we may or may not see out of the European Union,\u201d Quintenz said.  CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo had urged the Europe to defer to the home supervisor of a foreign clearing house, but the EU went ahead with approving its reform,  ESMA Chair Steven Maijoor told the conference that the EU and U.S. approaches shared the same thinking.  Maijoor said powers over foreign clearing houses were needed as Brexit raised concerns of regulatory \u201carbitrage\u201d, whereby firms seek to exploit differences between jurisdictions.  Even if rules are close to one another, there is still the risk of regulatory competition, Maijoor said.","214":"April 3 (Reuters) - CME Group Inc:  * CME GROUP REACHES HIGHEST-EVER QUARTERLY AVERAGE DAILY VOLUME OF 22.2 MILLION CONTRACTS FOR FIRST-QUARTER 2018  * QUARTERLY ADV OF 22.2 MILLION CONTRACTS, UP 30 PERCENT  * QTRLY OPTIONS VOLUME CONTRACTS PER DAY UP 31 PERCENT Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","215":"LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - CME, one of the world\u2019s biggest exchanges, said it has received approval from the Dutch finance ministry for its new trading platforms in Amsterdam to avoid disruption to customers from Brexit.

LCH\u2019s dominance in London of clearing euro-denominated trades has become a political battleground as Britain prepares to leave the bloc next month, taking it outside EU financial law.  Paul Elkins, head of product development at RepoClear LCH, said its Paris clearing operation handled more than 700 billion euros ($793.24 billion) of euro-denominated repo and government debt transactions on Wednesday, leaving only a \u201cresidual\u201d amount at the London operation.  \u201cThe vast majority of repo trades are now being cleared by LCH in Paris,\u201d Elkins told Reuters.  A repo or repurchase agreement is a type of short-term loan for dealers in government debt. From next Monday, Paris will also be clearing all euro-denominated cash government bonds at LCH, Elkins said.  Corentine Poilvet-Clediere, head of RepoClear at LCH in Paris, said customers wanted to consolidate euro repo and bond clearing in one place to obtain efficiency savings.  But some policymakers and central bankers in the euro zone want the bulk of all types of euro trades transacted by EU customers to be cleared inside the bloc.  The shift in repos and bonds may not be enough to satisfy them as LCH in London clears nearly all euro denominated interest rate swaps (IRS), a popular contract used by companies to hedge against unexpected moves in borrowing costs.  Bank of France Governor Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau said last November he wants to see interest rate derivatives clearing in Paris, but so far LCH has said it will not make the investment due to lack of customer demand.  \u201cLCH has been very transparent from the beginning. From our conversations with customers, we thought that for repo there was a business and regulatory case for consolidation in Paris,\u201d Poilvet-Clediere said.  After \u201ccrunching the numbers\u201d, moving IRS clearing from London to Paris would not be the right solution for the market, a view backed by users, Poilvet-Clediere said.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  (Reuters) - Exchange operator CME Group's CME.O third-quarter profit topped Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, as increased market volatility lifted trading volumes and boosted transaction fees.  A protracted U.S.-China trade spat and fears of an economic downturn kept volatility high in the third quarter, benefiting exchange operators like CME who make a bulk of their money from clearing and settling trades.  Clearing and transaction fees, CME\u2019s biggest revenue stream, rose 38.3% to $1.04 billion, lifted by a 30% jump in average daily volumes (ADV) to 20.2 million contracts.  Revenue from the market data and information services business, which helps investors to make trading decisions and minimize risk, rose 17.3% to $129.8 million.  Net income attributable to the company surged to $636.3 million, or $1.78 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $411.8 million, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier.  Stripping out one-time items, the Chicago-based company earned a profit of $1.90 per share, while analysts had expected $1.76 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Total revenue soared 41.3% to $1.28 billion.","221":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - When the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that a slew of key farm reports would not be released on Friday due to the partial government shutdown, the phones at crop forecaster Gro Intelligence blew up.  FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Department of Agriculture is seen in Washington, DC, U.S., March 18, 2012. REUTERS\/Gary Cameron\/File Photo  The USDA was set to release its views on the projected size of U.S. soybean stockpiles, among other data, following a record-large domestic harvest and a trade war with China that has slowed U.S. exports.  Commodity traders, economists, grain merchants and farmers are anxious for crop updates as they work to project their financial balance sheets and make spring planting decisions.  \u201cIt\u2019s been crazy busy,\u201d said Sara Menker, chief executive of New York-based Gro Intelligence.  The shutdown, now in its third week, has rippled across the already struggling U.S. farm economy ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s planned address at the American Farm Bureau conference in Louisiana on Monday. Federal loan and farm aid applications have also been delayed.  To fill the void on data, traders and farmers are relying on private crop forecasters, satellite imagery firms and brokerages offering analyses on trade and supplies. Some have been scouring Twitter for tidbits on shifting weather patterns and rumors of grain exports, but say it is difficult to replace the USDA.  \u201cWe\u2019re just doing the best we can, looking for as much information as is available,\u201d said Brian Basting, economist for Illinois-based broker Advance Trading, which provides customers its own harvest and crop supply estimates.  Dan Henebry, an Illinois corn and soy farmer, said the absence of USDA data was difficult.  \u201cYou delay all these reports and the market has no idea where to go, other than trade guesses,\u201d Henebry said.  HUNT FOR NUMBERS  Gro Intelligence has been offering free access to its data platform since Dec. 27, and released worldwide supply-demand crop forecasts on Friday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The company\u2019s estimates for the U.S. 2018-2019 corn crop yield were 177.4 bushels per acre, below both USDA\u2019s last forecast and lower than the average of estimates in a Reuters survey. Gro pegged the U.S. 2018-2019 soybean yield at 50.6 bushels per acre, also below USDA and below the range of Reuters\u2019 survey.  The company will keep its platform open for the duration of the shutdown, Menker said.  So far, Menker said, the site has signed up executives from the top 10 global agribusiness companies and financial institutions with credit exposure to U.S. agriculture.  Data firm Mercaris has gained new subscribers too, as it has become the only source for organic commodity prices since the halt in USDA reports, sales director Alex Heilman said. The Maryland-based company is making an additional pricing report available to users for free until the federal agency reopens.  \u201cEverybody still needs this information for creating contracts, new product lines, planting acres,\u201d Heilman said.  Farmers Business Network (FBN), which collects harvest data from 7,000 U.S. farmers, was set to release crop yield estimates on Friday to members. The data is not as comprehensive as the USDA\u2019s report would have been, though, said Kevin McNew, FBN\u2019s chief economist.  \u201cAt the end of the day, we still need a benchmark,\u201d McNew said. \u201cFor better or worse, USDA is the best benchmark we have.\u201d  Trading volume in Chicago Board of Trade grain futures typically jumps on the day in mid-January when the USDA releases its major reports. But without the reports on Friday, volume fell in the most actively traded corn and soy contracts, and rose less in wheat futures than it typically does when USDA issues its data, according to preliminary data from CBOT owner CME Group Inc.  While crops are not growing in North America during the winter season, traders are still looking for updated information from South America and other parts of the world where soy and other crops are growing.  An increase in private companies using government-collected satellite images to track farmed fields in recent years helps shine a light on global crop conditions even while government agencies are dark. The government\u2019s Landsat satellites continue to collect images of the earth and other data.  Private companies such as New Mexico-based crop forecaster Descartes Labs can still access the open-sourced data and analyze it. The public can normally see those images on the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s website, but it is not being updated during the shutdown, according to a notice on the site.  And all technology can be problematic, said Steve Truitt, government program manager for Descartes.  Data occasionally has shown up late during the shutdown, or not arrived, Truitt said. The USDA and Interior Department staffers who Descartes usually calls either cannot be reached or are working without pay, he said, leading to awkward conversations.","222":"FILE PHOTO: A man enters the CME Group offices in New York, U.S., October 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  CHICAGO (Reuters) - CME Group Inc said on Thursday it plans to increase the daily trading limits for its lean hog futures in April and then adjust them annually because of heightened volatility linked to the outbreak of a fatal pig disease in China.  The spread of African swine fever in China, the world\u2019s biggest pork consumer, has fueled swings in futures prices <0#LH:> by raising expectations for increased Chinese demand for U.S. pork. Uncertainty persists about the size and timing of sales, after Beijing agreed to buy more U.S. agricultural goods as part of an interim trade deal signed in January.  The outbreak has also reordered meat trading around the world and prompted major U.S. pork producers to remove a growth drug banned by China from their supply chains. African swine fever has spread to Southeast Asia and eastern Europe.  \u201cThe spread of African swine fever and the ongoing US\/China trade war have combined to produce very high levels of volatility,\u201d CME Group said in a memo this month.  Starting on April 13, CME Group will raise the daily limit to 3.75 cents per pound from 3 cents, according to a separate notice sent to customers. The limit will temporarily expand to 5.5 cents if any of the front eight contract months settle at the initial limit. Currently, limits temporarily expand to 4.5 cents if any of the front three contract months settle at the initial limit.  The limits will be reset annually on the first trading day in September, based on previous daily settlement prices, according to the notice. The reset limit will remain in effect through the last trading day in August of the next year.  Hog futures settled at their daily price limit 31 times, or 14%, in 2019, according to CME Group. This year, the market settled at its daily limit on four days as of Feb. 7, the exchange said in its memo.  CME Group wants to avoid too many settlements at the daily limit because they inhibit price discovery and prevent traders from executing orders. The changes would go into effect upon approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.","223":"(Adds company news items, futures)  July 5 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is seen opening two points lower at 7,602 on Friday, according to financial bookmakers, with futures down 0.08% ahead of the cash market open.  * AQUIS EXCHANGE: Bourse services group Aquis Exchange will buy British growth stocks platform NEX Exchange from CME Group for a nominal one pound plus 2.7 million pounds ($3.4 million) to cover NEX\u2019s working capital, Aquis said on Friday.  * SIG: Building materials supplier SIG Plc reported 3.8% lower like-for-like sales for the first half of the year as construction activity fell in the second quarter in the face of challenging market conditions in the UK and Ireland.  * JOHN MENZIES: UK aviation servicing company John Menzies Plc said it expects lower annual profit, hurt by aviation market challenges, weak cargo volumes and flight schedule reductions.  * ENERGEAN: Israel-focused Energean said on Thursday has agreed to buy the oil and gas division of Italian energy company Edison for up to $850 million.  * GLENCORE: Congolese security forces evicted thousands of illegal miners from a copper and cobalt mine run by Glencore on Thursday, sparking angry protests outside the governor\u2019s office and looting of shops, local activists said.  * GOLD: Gold prices edged higher and were on track for a seventh consecutive weekly gain, as investors awaited U.S. employment data that could influence expectations about aggressive policy easing by the Federal Reserve.  * OIL: Crude oil prices fell as concerns over the outlook for global economic growth outweighed elevated tensions in the Middle East that could disrupt supply routes and send prices higher.  * The UK blue chip index closed 0.1% lower on Thursday, while shares of IAG and Coca Cola HBC slid as they traded ex-dividend, though several investors stayed on the sidelines during the U.S. market holiday.  * For more on the factors affecting European stocks, please click on:  TODAY\u2019S UK PAPERS  > Financial Times  > Other business headlines (Reporting by Samantha Machado and Adil Bhat in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)","224":"LONDON (Reuters) - A pan-European Union record of stock and bond trades would cost 11 million euros ($13 million) to build and save investors billions, a study commissioned by the bloc said on Wednesday.  A record, known as a \u201cconsolidated tape\u201d or CT, would collate prices and volumes of shares and bonds traded on multiple platforms to help investors make better decisions, and provide regulators with improved data to spot market abuses.  Past attempts at creating a tape have stumbled over pricing data, with banks accusing platforms of charging rip-off prices for feeds that would make a tape uneconomic, a view rejected by exchanges.  The EU\u2019s European Commission executive said last month it would propose legislation in a year\u2019s time to create a tape for share trading, long a feature of Wall Street, to help deepen the EU capital market.  \u201cThere is high demand for CT data and the benefits of delivering the data clearly outweigh the cost of implementing it,\u201d the study by The Market Practice consultants said.  The bloc\u2019s European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should select and regulate a single tape provider as a not-for-profit utility, the study said.  Initially, it could track prices and volumes at which stock and bond trades were executed, and include bids and offers from brokers later on.  Setting up a tape would cost 11 million euros, funded by a one-off joining fee for data aggregators like exchanges, the study said. It was impossible to quantify total benefits but market users say they currently rely on \u201csub-optimal\u201d data, which bumps up costs.  Annual running costs would be 7-9 million euros, funded by membership fees of about 16,000 euros a year on each data aggregator, the study said.  The data should be provided free to the tape, with contributors getting a slice of the revenues on sales to professional investors, with free access for retail investors, it added.  CT Graphic:","225":"(Repeats story that ran on Wednesday with no change to headline or text)  NEW YORK, May 30 (Reuters) - Treasury market bears on Wednesday clawed back some of the crushing losses suffered a day earlier after anxiety about the instability of the Italian government triggered a safe-haven stampede into U.S. government debt, forcing those with bets on bond weakness to rush for the exits.  Data released on Wednesday from CME Group Inc showed open interest in its benchmark Treasury and interest rate futures contracts plunged by more than 400,000 contracts on Tuesday, signaling a frantic dash to close out wrong-footed positions.  Outstanding positions in 2-year Treasury note futures alone dropped by more than 266,000 contracts, meaning traders closed out more than 11 percent of all open interest in a single day. For 10-year futures, open interest fell by around 137,000 as trading volume in the benchmark contract hit a record.  \u201cSome people were short coming in and then they flipped,\u201d Greg Adamsick, director of global futures and options at RCM Alternatives in Chicago, said on Wednesday.  Last week, hedge funds\u2019 net short positions in 10-year Treasury notes fell to the lowest level in nearly two months, while bond dealers raised net shorts in 10-year T-notes to the highest since February 2016.  \u201cOne would have to think a lot of short positions, especially weak ones, had to capitulate,\u201d said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed income at D.A. Davidson in Seattle.  Less than two weeks ago, the 10-year Treasury yield broke above 3.10 percent to its highest levels in nearly seven years on expectations of rising inflation and federal borrowing.  But since then, bond yields have begun retreating on worries about the renewed trade tension between China and the United States; cancellation of a nuclear summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and Turkey\u2019s economic policies under President Tayyip Erdogan.  Some analysts also reckoned Treasuries were simply oversold.  Although bond bears regained some footing as the market gave back some of Tuesday\u2019s dramatic gains, yields remained well below their seven-year high.  On Wednesday, the 10-year yield rose to 2.855 percent as Italian politicians scrambled for a deal to form a government, reducing some safe-haven bond holdings from the day before. The 10-year yield had fallen to 2.759 percent on Tuesday, which was the lowest since April 11, according to Reuters data.  The boon for U.S. Treasury securities on Tuesday resulted in a 0.952 percent total return on the day, the biggest one-day gain since July 29, 2011, according to an index compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays.  The reversal in market sentiment was captured by a closely followed survey from J.P. Morgan.  It showed that the share of J.P. Morgan\u2019s Treasury customers who are holding fewer longer-dated government issues than their benchmarks was equal to the share of customers who are holding more longer-dated bonds than their benchmarks on Tuesday.  This was the least bearish their clients were on Treasuries since April 2017.  In the short-term term, bearish bond bets remain vulnerable to political developments in Europe as Italy seeks to form a government and a possible no-confidence vote of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Friday.  \u201cI hardly think we are out of the woods,\u201d D.A. Davidson\u2019s Hurley said.","226":"BRUSSELS, Dec 4 (Reuters) - European Union governments agreed on Wednesday new rules for handling failures of clearing houses, an EU statement said, in a move that would increase the burden on these firms to limit losses that might rock the financial system.

China\u2019s plan follows the opening of its iron ore futures to foreign investors in May, and would challenge iron ore options in Singapore, where the bulk of global trade is concentrated, as well as in New York.  It would follow China\u2019s launch of sugar and soymeal options last year and copper options which debuted just last week.  \u201cThe Dalian Commodity Exchange is still working on preparations for the iron ore options. But it won\u2019t take too long and could be launched by the end of 2019 at the latest,\u201d the source told Reuters, declining to be identified as the plan has not been approved by market regulators.  When contacted for a comment, the Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) referred Reuters to a speech by DCE General Manager Wang Fenghai at an industry conference last week where he said the exchange \u201cwill actively promote iron ore options and also aim to launch scrap steel futures as soon as possible.\u201d  The China Securities Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.  As a hedging tool, options would allow iron ore traders, miners and steel mills to manage price exposure, giving the buyer the right - but no obligation - to assume a futures position at a specified price.  SINGAPORE OPTIONS  The ability to carry out hedging trades could encourage more primary users to take part in the iron ore futures market, which traders say has been dominated by speculative investors who have deserted the market recently amid stagnant prices.  Iron ore options are mainly traded on the Singapore Exchange, with 1.77 million contracts, equal to 176.8 million tonnes, traded in January to August, exchange data showed. New York-based CME Group Inc also offers iron ore options.  The Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) allowed foreign investors to directly trade iron ore futures for the first time in May, hoping the most liquid iron ore derivative in the world would benefit from more institutional investors.  It was the second commodity that China opened to outside investors after the launch of crude oil futures in March.  But open contracts held by investors in Dalian iron ore futures fell to a 3-1\/2-year low on Tuesday, to 822,452 lots, and trading volumes nearly halved in August from May, which traders say shows that the bulk of the market remains in the hands of local speculators.  The source said he did not expect Chinese regulators to delay approval of DCE\u2019s iron ore options, as offering existing participants a new tool would have less risk than opening the futures market to overseas investors.

Asset managers and banks in the United States and Europe have long called on regulators to force exchanges to cut the price of data. Bourses say they are not gouging customers.  The FCA said feedback from market participants suggested that some trading venues and benchmark administrators may not face sufficient competitive pressure, allowing them to charge high prices to customers and competitors.  It said it was using a \u201ccall for input\u201d to better understand how data and advanced analytics are being accessed and used, the value offered to participants in wholesale markets, and whether they are competitively sold and priced.  \u201cThe FCA wants to know whether users have concerns with the way trading data, benchmarks and vendor services are priced and sold,\u201d the watchdog said in a statement.  Data includes prices, bid\/ask quotes and volumes of all financial instruments like stocks and bonds.  The Federation of European Securities Exchanges, an industry body, said last year that market data costs have remained stable in recent years, and the real issue was the often low quality of data from off-exchange or \u201cdark\u201d trading platforms.  The FCA said its review would determine if it needed to act, such as by improving competition between data vendors, or making it easier to switch between benchmark providers.  Data has become a revenue driver for exchanges as tougher competition in trading erodes margins.  The London Stock Exchange is buying data and analytics vendor Refinitiv for $27 billion. Refinitiv is 45%-owned by Thomson Reuters, which owns Reuters News.  Under European Union \u201cMiFID II\u201d securities laws, asset managers and banks must show clients they have \u201cexecuted\u201d share trades at the best prices and need data from exchanges for this.  EU markets watchdog ESMA said in December that MiFID II had failed to cut the cost of stock market data, effectively making it uneconomic to build a pan-European feed for investors to compare share prices on different platforms and compete better with U.S. markets.  The EU\u2019s executive European Commission has responded by consulting on possible changes to MiFID II.  Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union in January means that the FCA will have no say in how the bloc intervenes in market data pricing.  Britain cut and pasted MiFID II into UK law ahead of Brexit and would therefore have to make any changes itself.  The FCA noted interventions in the United States, where the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed rules in January to govern data feeds after pressure from banks and asset managers.  The review, which closes in May, will look at firms that the FCA regulates and \u201cconnected, non-regulated activities and firms\u201d and the FCA will set out its next steps in the autumn.","231":"LONDON (Reuters) - Keeping U.S. markets open during the coronavirus epidemic is critical for maintaining investor confidence, exchanges and market industry bodies said in a joint statement on Friday.

The company said it will offer a new WTI Houston crude futures contract with three physical delivery locations on the Enterprise Products Partners LP\u2019s Houston system, beginning in the fourth quarter.  The new WTI Houston futures contract will be listed with and subject to the rules of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), beginning with the January 2019 contract month.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a primarily commercial contract to start with \u2013 we\u2019re seeing this as something that will be of interest to producers, exporters and importers,\u201d said Owain Johnson, managing director of energy research at CME.  The WTI Houston contract\u2019s specifications will be about 40-44 degrees API gravity and 0.275 percent sulfur.  Benchmark U.S. crude futures are currently deliverable at Cushing, Oklahoma. However, the growth in exports has underscored the hub\u2019s waning influence as the primary measuring stick for the U.S. oil market and the leading barometer of future supply, demand and prices.  CME\u2019s announcement comes after rival Intercontinental Exchange said in July it would offer a crude futures contract deliverable at Magellan Midstream Partners\u2019 East Houston terminal.

By Monday, oil traders were awash with supply and struggling to find enough ships, railcars and pipelines to store fuel.  The situation was compounded as the West Texas Intermediate crude benchmark May contract headed into expiry the following day, meaning traders would have to take delivery of yet more oil. At one point, physical traders were paying $40 per barrel to anyone who would take the oil off their hands.  That pushed the contract below $0 for the first time in history, settling at negative $37.63.  CFTC chair Heath Tarbert and CME Group Inc, home to the benchmark, said this week that the volatility appeared to be due to these fundamental supply and demand issues, rather than a financial markets issue.  Nevertheless, the gyrations have sparked worries of potential foul play or system failures, with billionaire oilman and President Donald Trump ally Harold Hamm asking the CFTC on Tuesday to launch a formal probe.  Traders have also criticized CME for allowing prices to go negative so quickly, since the oil still has tangible value.  \u201cWe will examine the root cause of this move, including whether there have been any violations of the Commodity Exchange Act that could have contributed to (it),\u201d Berkovitz said.\u201d  A CFTC spokesman has said it is closely monitoring market developments. CFTC has invested heavily in data analytic capabilities over the past decade.  In addition to combing the trading data for irregularities, the agency will assess whether the contract is working as a tool to determine fair and accurate oil prices, and any other factors that may have exacerbated volatility, the spokesman said.  Probes into dramatic market moves can take years.  It took five years for the U.S. to charge a UK trader for precipitating the May 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d that briefly wiped nearly $1 trillion off the market, after initially saying no one individual was responsible.

FILE PHOTO - A compex network of pipes and tanks convert corn into ethanol inside the Lincolnway Energy plant in the town of Nevada, Iowa, December 6, 2007. REUTERS\/Jason Reed  The push comes as the key farm belt industry struggles with weak demand growth, a loss of export markets due to the U.S. trade war with China, and aggressive selling by global commodities giant Archer Daniels Midland Co ADM.N that have pushed ethanol prices to 13-year lows.  ADM is better placed to survive a long stretch of low prices than its ethanol-focused U.S. rivals, many of whom are concerned the company is deliberately pressuring the biofuel market lower to drive them out of business and are keen for a stable hedging tool to defend against further dips.  Top U.S. ethanol producer POET LLC has asked the CME Group CME.O to change its pricing method for a key swap contract used by the industry to hedge, and the rival ICE exchange is contemplating offering an alternative to CME's product after discussions with biofuels companies, according to three sources familiar with the moves who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly.  CME's Chicago ethanol swap contract CUUc1 is the most widely used derivative instrument the industry uses to protect itself against market fluctuations. But traders have recently been reluctant to use the contract for fear it will expose them to further losses due to the strong selling by ADM.  CME currently calculates the swap contract\u2019s value by averaging the monthly daily settlement price in the physical market as provided by commodities pricing company Platts. Several ethanol producers want that method changed.  Critics say the Platts price can be easily manipulated because it is based on deals that occur only during a 30 minute window each day, as opposed to during the whole day. In November, ADM represented more than 90 percent of sales in the Chicago Platts window, two traders said.  ADM declined to comment for the story and has never publicly defended itself against criticism about its activity in the trading window. ADM CEO Juan Ricardo Luciano blamed overproduction and the loss of sales to China for the industry\u2019s recent woes in the latest earnings call.  Platts did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story.  The issue has become more urgent as slumping prices force ADM rivals like Green Plains, POET and Valero to shut, idle, or sell off plants. U.S. ethanol prices have dropped below $1.20 a gallon 1ZEc1, the lowest in about 13 years, with inventories swelling to records.  POET, the nation\u2019s leading ethanol producer at two billion gallons a year, last month filed a complaint about the issue with CME, which sets the rules for the ethanol swap contract, the company confirmed to Reuters.  \u201cPOET submitted a complaint to CME outlining our concerns regarding the Chicago Ethanol Swap contract. Our concerns are with the market-influencing impacts of this specific contract,\u201d POET spokesman Matt Merritt said in an email.  He declined to provide other details.  Two sources who read the letter said the complaint argues the swap contract is based on a flawed pricing method that a single company can manipulate. The letter does not identify ADM, the sources said.  CME spokesman Chris Grams declined comment.  A rival derivatives exchange, Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N, is considering offering an alternative to CME's contract that would incorporate some of the changes sought by ethanol traders, such as using a full-day average physical price to determine the settlement price, the two sources, along with an additional source familiar with the effort, told Reuters.  ICE is planning to study the idea until at least the end of the year before making any decision, the sources said.  ICE said, \u201cWe are constantly evaluating opportunities that could meet customer demand and complement our global energy suite.\u201d  Separately, terminal operator Zenith Energy Management is talking to traders about the possibility of a new ethanol storage hub in Joliet, Illinois, to rival Kinder Morgan Inc's KMI.N Argo terminal near Chicago \u2013 the main delivery point for Chicago ethanol, the two sources familiar with the efforts said.  The terminal, about 30 miles south of Argo, would allow shippers to bypass congested rail lines in Chicago and provide a new outlet to other trading hubs where prices are higher.  A spokesperson for Zenith did not respond to a request for comment.  It is unclear to what extent other ethanol producers have joined the efforts to make changes to pricing.  Ethanol maker Green Plains Inc GPRE.O told investors in a recent earnings call that it was working with other companies to seek alternatives to the current pricing methodology, without elaborating.","237":"HONG KONG, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) were set to fall 3.3% on Thursday after the bourse unveiled a $39 billion takeover approach to the London Stock Exchange Plc (LSE) on Wednesday.

FILE PHOTO: Crude oil storage tanks are seen from above at the Cushing oil hub, in Cushing, Oklahoma, March 24, 2016. REUTERS\/Nick Oxford\/File Photo  U.S. crude prices for 2019 and 2020 CLYstc1CLYstc2, based on an average of each year's monthly contracts, have climbed this week above $68 and $64 a barrel, respectively, the highest levels in over three years. The rally comes even as front-month prices CLc1 have dropped from the 3-1\/2-year highs touched during the summer.  \u201cHedging activity has picked up considerably over recent weeks and this will continue to be the case as producers begin to frame budgets for next year,\u201d said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, noting the rally in forward prices are encouraging the producer bets.  Hedging can reduce risks associated with volatility in oil prices, acting as an insurance contract to lock in a future selling price and fix spending plans. Such longer-term bets signal U.S. producers will continue to expand output, keeping a lid on prices, according to crude traders and brokers.  The nation\u2019s output this year has climbed above 10 million barrels per day (bpd), close to top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. That output is forecast to grow next year by 840,000 bpd to average 11.5 million bpd.  There was a large uptick in crude swap activity last week, with just shy of 8 million barrels changing hands in a day, an energy derivatives broker said, signaling strong hedging interest. Swaps are a type of contract that allow producers to lock in or fix the price they receive for their oil production.  Almost 80 percent of the swap activity was split evenly between calendars 2020 and 2019, and the remaining 20 percent for this year, the broker said, adding that there was a small amount of calendar 2021 activity during the week.  The market sources declined to say which oil companies were actively hedging in recent weeks.  The move to hedge at these levels could prove risky for producers in a market where the price of oil for immediate delivery is higher than for later deliveries.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Many U.S. shale producers hedged second-quarter production at about $55 a barrel, which backfired as U.S. crude climbed to more than $70 a barrel last quarter, the highest level since 2014.  As a result, producers are using more \u201ccollars,\u201d a financial instrument that provides price protection on the downside while allowing them to share in some of the upside if prices rally.  \"We've been building a lot of collar structures,\" Christian Kendall, chief executive of Denbury Resources Inc DNR.N said last week, noting that the instruments will protect its production at about $60 a barrel and provide upside if oil rises to the high $70s per barrel.  Denbury is nearly 50 percent hedged for 2019 and will add hedges to get to 60 percent to 70 percent of production, Kendall said.  Meanwhile, oil companies that drill in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where local prices are $14 below futures WTC-WTM because of full pipelines, are turning to a type of hedge geared to protecting them against regional weaknesses.  \"We have done an extensive amount of basis hedging,\" said Javan Ottoson, chief executive of SM Energy Co SM.N, which reported 11.2 million barrels of 2019 Permian oil production covered by basis hedges compared with 6.9 million barrels of 2018 production similarly covered at this time last year.  Permian producers increased their 2020 oil-basis hedge positions by more than fourfold last quarter over the prior quarter with Concho Resources Inc CXO.N and Energen Corp EGN.N leading the surge, said consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  For 2019, Midland-Cushing basis hedging rose by 52 percent and the consultancy attributed the sharp increases to worries that new pipelines may be delayed past their planned startups beginning in 2019.  Open interest in U.S. crude futures for delivery in 13 months to 36 months and beyond has grown in almost every month so far in 2018, CME Group Inc CME.O said.

FILE PHOTO: People walk through the lobby of the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain August 25, 2015. REUTERS\/Suzanne Plunkett\/File Photo  Britain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31, but has yet to agree a divorce settlement with the bloc.  Brussels has said that if there is a no-deal Brexit, investment firms in the EU must trade about 6,200 euro-denominated shares in the bloc; many are currently heavily traded in London.  \u201cIt is therefore easy to conclude that for those shares, market liquidity would be damaged to no good end,\u201d Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said in a speech at Bloomberg.  The FCA will decide soon how to reciprocate on share trading, and Brussels has urged the watchdog not to require UK firms to trade euro shares in Britain as this would create an overlap that fragments trading.  Bailey said the best solution would be for Brussels to grant so-called temporary equivalence, or allow cross border share trading to continue in the event of a no-deal Brexit, as it has already done with derivatives clearing.  \u201cThe EU have said to date they will not do that,\u201d he added.  Equivalence is the main form of EU financial market access for non-member state countries. Brussels decides whether a foreign firm\u2019s rules are aligned enough with those in the bloc.  \u201cWe stand ready to enter into dialogue with our European counterparts before we finalise our approach,\u201d Bailey said.  Brussels has granted temporary equivalence for derivatives clearing so that EU customers could continue using clearing houses in London, but only until March 2020 if there is a no-deal Brexit.  This reflected Britain\u2019s original plan to leave the EU in March, and Bailey said Brussels would need to grant an extension soon to avoid costly disruption in markets.  Without an extension, clearing houses in Britain like the London Stock Exchange\u2019s LCH may have to tell EU customers by December to begin closing or moving derivatives positions from Britain by the end of March.  \u201cUltimately, the best solution is for the EU to grant permanent recognition to UK CCPs (clearing houses),\u201d Bailey said.  The EU is keen to build up its own capital market capacity for trading and clearing to avoid relying on London after Brexit and has made it clear that granting permanent equivalence would not be automatic.  Bailey said British rules would be identical to those in the bloc on day one of Brexit, meaning equivalence should not be an issue.  Britain, however, must not end up being a \u201ctaker\u201d of EU rules, or having to copy the bloc\u2019s regulation after Brexit for years to come to maintain EU access, he said.","244":"Oct 4 (Reuters) - Open interest on U.S. bond and interest rates jumped on Wednesday in the aftermath of a market selloff that propelled Treasury yields to multiyear peaks, CME Group data released on Thursday showed.

This week the LME launched a suite of cash-settled futures contracts including hot rolled coil steel, used widely in the engineering and auto industries, for North America and China.  The exchange\u2019s North America and China contracts will compete with the U.S.-based CME Group\u2019s Nymex steel contract and with Shanghai Futures Exchange\u2019s Chinese steel contract.  The LME\u2019s dollar-based European steel contract, by contrast, has no significant competitors, but the exchange has been forced to delay its launch because Europe prices steel in euros.  A steel industry source said major companies using steel derivatives had been \u201cvocal about the contract being denominated in euros from the day the LME announced plans to look at it\u201d.  \u201cAs a global market, the LME is principally designed with the dollar as the primary currency for trading and clearing across all contracts,\u201d the LME said in response to request for comment.  Trading sources say switching the contract specification to euros is not difficult and that the problem lay with LME Clear, which can only clear dollar-based contracts.  \u201cThey haven\u2019t given us a definite timeline for when the European steel contract might be resurrected. It won\u2019t be this year, fixing LME Clear is going to be a costly exercise and could take until next year,\u201d a steel trader said.  LME Clear will need a major overhaul to clear euro contracts, which will involve a large amount of investment and time, sources said.  \u201cIf the LME doesn\u2019t have the resources, the European contract may have to be abandoned, unless the industry agrees to try and work with a dollar denomination,\u201d another steel industry source said.  \u201cThe European steel contract was conspicuous by its absence, there was a fair amount of interest in it. We were looking at it as a possible hedging tool. For us a dollar contract would create currency risk.\u201d  The risk comes from fluctuations in the dollar\u2019s exchange rate against the euro as many companies may not have access to facilities that allow hedging against adverse currency moves.  \u201cNew contracts take a long time to pick up any sort of momentum and starting off with a handicap like this (dollar price) would not have been ideal,\u201d another steel trader said.  The LME already has contracts for steel rebar, a type of construction steel, and steel scrap, which have enjoyed modest success since their 2015 launch and brought much relief to the exchange after its steel billet contract failed.  Some 4.9 million tonnes of scrap and 544,000 tonnes of rebar were traded on the LME last year, versus some 3 million tonnes of scrap and 644,000 tonnes of rebar traded in 2017, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.  Having lost some market share in recent years to the CME and ShfE, the LME was hoping to make inroads into steel, a global industry worth about $900 billion a year.  If the exchange succeeds, it would not only provide a welcome source of revenue and volumes to the 142-year-old LME, but could also change the way the steel industry hedges and prices contracts. (Reporting by Pratima Desai and Maytaal Angel; editing by David Evans)","246":"(Repeats item published earlier on Tuesday, no changes to content)  April 3 (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve on Tuesday will begin to publish the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), a rate that regulators hope will eventually be adopted to back U.S. dollar-based derivatives and loans. The aim is that the new rate will eventually reduce markets\u2019 dependence on Libor.  Following are some facts about the rate.  What is SOFR?  SOFR is based on transactions in the Treasury repurchase market, where banks and investors borrow or loan Treasuries overnight. A group of large banks, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC), selected the rate as an alternative to the London interbank offered rate (Libor) in derivatives. It cited the depth and robustness of the market where around $800 billion is traded daily.  Why do we need a new rate?  Regulators including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are seeking to reduce markets\u2019 reliance on Libor due to a decline in loans backing the rate. If the rate stops being published \u201cthat has all the potential of being a pretty significant financial stability problem,\u201d Powell said in February.  The ARRC, which selected SOFR as an alternative rate, said in March that Libor underpins $200 trillion in derivatives and loans, more than previously thought, underscoring the necessity of promoting a robust alternative. Derivatives account for 95 percent of the exposures.  Why was there a decline in usage of Libor?  Reforms to banking and money market fund regulations resulted in fewer interbank short-term loans and reduced demand for the bank debt. Also, Libor\u2019s reputation was damaged by charges that banks manipulated the rate before and during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, often to book larger profits on derivatives based on the rate. Libor rates are sometimes estimated rather than based on actual transactions.  Will it replace Libor?  SOFR is intended to work alongside Libor. Over time, regulators hope that more derivatives and loans will be backed by the rate, which will decrease the importance of Libor. The New York Fed\u2019s publication of the rate is the first in a series of steps to enable a transition. The CME Group will begin trading futures based on the rate on May 7. Major dealers and clearinghouses that guarantee interest rate swap trades are also working to enable swaps based on the new rate. The head of Britain\u2019s financial markets regulator said last year that a Libor substitute must be in place for banks to use by the end of 2021, and that Libor must be replaced because there are not enough transactions underpinning the rates.  Is this the first global effort to find an alternative?  No. Regulators have pushed internationally to find alternatives to Libor and its equivalents. A British committee last year selected SONIA, an unsecured overnight lending rate, as an alternative to sterling-based Libor and Japan selected TONAR as an alternative to yen Libor, also an unsecured rate. A group in Switzerland selected SARON, a collateralized rate based on the Swiss repo market.  The European Central Bank is developing a daily euro unsecured overnight index rate.","247":"FILE PHOTO: A collection of Bitcoin (virtual currency) tokens are displayed in this picture illustration taken December 8, 2017.

The exchange, which owns the lucrative volatility index the VIX, has taken several steps to confront manipulation claims that have helped drive the Cboe\u2019s stock down about 15 percent this year, putting it on pace for its worst year ever.  In its latest effort to police trading tied to the index, the Cboe is working with FINRA, its regulatory services provider, to develop machine learning techniques to tell whether market conditions surrounding the VIX settlement are potentially anomalous, the exchange told Reuters.  \u201cIncorporating the use of machine learning and AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a logical part of the ongoing enhancement of our overall regulatory program,\u201d Greg Hoogasian, Cboe chief regulatory officer, said in an emailed statement.  Cboe declined to elaborate on when it began using machine learning techniques to monitor VIX settlements.  Any steps, however, may take a while to change investors\u2019 minds on the stock.  \u201cAny time you see controversy over manipulating markets and it involves a company, there are people who will walk away from the stock,\u201d said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.  \u201cIt ends up tarnishing the company and subjecting them to legal risk that is very hard to quantify,\u201d he said.  Tuz said Chase Investment Counsel, which owned nearly 19,000 Cboe shares in mid-2017, began selling its stake early this year, shedding the last of it on May 21.  Cboe\u2019s stock performance this year has lagged that of other major exchange operators. Shares of Nasdaq Inc are up about 17 percent, Intercontinental Exchange Inc\u2019s is up about 10 percent and CME Group Inc shares have risen 18 percent.  Concerns the index was being manipulated surfaced last year after John Griffin and Amin Shams of the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas, Austin wrote an academic paper that noted significant spikes in trading volume in S&P 500 index options right at the time of settlement.  The paper also compared the value of the VIX at settlement with its value as calculated from S&P 500 options right after the settlement, and showed the two tend to diverge.  Instances of big deviations are taken as evidence by some that unscrupulous traders have been deliberately moving the settlement price.  A stock market fall on Feb. 5 that caused the VIX to surge the most in its 25-year history brought further scrutiny to the index, and led to dozens of lawsuits and ongoing probes into the matter by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The regulators have yet to comment on the matter and Cboe has denied the manipulation accusations, citing liquidity problems and legitimate hedging activity as reasons for unusual moves on settlement days.  \u201cOnly a forensic analysis of those episodes can confirm or refute such a claim,\u201d said Kambiz Kazemi, partner at Canadian investment management firm La Financi\u00e8re Constance.  Meanwhile, the steps Cboe has taken to address the claims of manipulation are going in the right direction, said Kazemi.  The exchange operator recently overhauled the technology behind the auctions, improved the speed with which it sends alerts about auction imbalances, and sought to increase the number of market makers that provide buy and sell quotes for the auction.  POLICING THE FEAR GAUGE  Orderly VIX settlement auctions over the last few months have helped take some of the pressure off the Chicago-based exchange operator.  \u201cI think we all will be observing the effects of the Cboe measures in the next few months,\u201d Kazemi said.  VIX and associated products accounted for roughly a quarter of Cboe\u2019s 2017 earnings, analysts estimate, and the controversy around the product has spooked some stockholders.  While financial firms have been using artificial intelligence software for everything from compliance to stock-picking, a growing number of firms have started to use it for market oversight.  Given the huge amount of data involved in market surveillance, machine learning algorithms can be far more efficient than humans in rooting out potential market manipulation, said Richard Johnson, a market structure and technology consultant at Greenwich Associates.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a must have,\u201d he said.

Britain left the European Union last month and is seeking access to the bloc\u2019s financial market once a \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d transition period ends in December.  The London Stock Exchange\u2019s LCH unit clears the bulk of euro denominated swaps but access to clients in the EU after December has yet to be worked out.  The EU has said any access would be contingent on Britain applying rules that are \u201cequivalent\u201d to those in the bloc.  Britain on Tuesday called for long-term equivalence but the EU said it would not guarantee permanent access.  For LCH, EU regulators must also satisfy themselves they can supervise the inner workings of the company given it handles vast amounts of euro-denominated contracts.  This would be done under a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the BoE and EU regulators. As a last resort, the EU can require EU investors use a clearing house in the bloc.  Cunliffe said cooperation could include EU regulators having a \u201cline of sight, joint discussions of risks and mitigation\u201d at UK-based firms, but such arrangements must be practical, Cunliffe said.  \u201cEffective supervision of systemically important firms in business as usual cannot be achieved with multiple hands on the steering wheel,\u201d Cunliffe said in a speech in Berlin.  \u201cFirms need clear and consistent messages. This is true, a fortiori, at times of stress.\u201d  UK authorities fear the MoU will not make clear that as home regulator the BoE is the point of contact for LCH, and not to go directly to the firm, and that the central bank has the last word in a crisis.  Cunliffe said arrangements for shared supervision need to be worked out carefully, subject to agreed procedures and recognise the primacy of a financial firm\u2019s home supervisor.  \u201cIt is perhaps human nature on either side to want maximum control and minimum responsibility. But a stable and effective regulatory and supervisory relationship cannot be built on those lines,\u201d Cunliffe said.  Meanwhile, the BoE is updating an MoU with U.S. regulators for supervising LCH and U.S. peers like ICE and CME.  It is expected to make clear that the home regulator has final say, helping to put pressure on the EU to follow suit in its MoU with Britain.","252":"LONDON (Reuters) - Two of the world's top exchanges, Chicago's Cboe Global Markets CBOE.O and the London Stock Exchange Group LSE.L will open European Union stock trading venues in Amsterdam in time for Britain's departure from the bloc next March, adding to the Dutch city's Brexit spoils.  FILE PHOTO: Tourists boats pass on a canal in Amsterdam, Netherlands, May 16, 2018. Picture taken May 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Francois Lenoir\/File Photo  Success in attracting Cboe Europe, the largest pan-European stock exchange by market share and its LSE-owned rival Turquoise are major wins for Amsterdam and help counter a trend for banks and funds to pick rival centers such as Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg.  London is Europe\u2019s biggest securities trading center and home to several pan-EU platforms including Cboe and Turquoise that must now rethink their cross-border set-up due to Brexit potentially fragmenting market access.  Amsterdam has already won business from platforms including Tradeweb and MarketAxess, wooed in part by the city\u2019s connectivity speeds, which have made it popular with so-called high-frequency traders.  London-based FX and fixed income trading platform NEX NXGN.L, which is being taken over by U.S. exchange CME CME.O, is opening an EU base in the Dutch financial capital.  New York Stock Exchange owner ICE ICE.N, whose European base is in London, has not said if it will expand its Dutch operations which include an energy exchange and little used clearing house.  \u201cWe believe that the Netherlands is supportive of competitive and open financial market infrastructure and we feel Amsterdam is a fantastic location to establish our EU venue,\u201d Mark Hemsley, president of Cboe Europe, said in a statement.  Cboe also said it had \u201clongstanding and good relations\u201d with the Dutch regulator and central bank, \u201cwhich have a deep understanding of the equities and derivatives markets\u201d.  The LSE already operates the Milan bourse and a Paris unit of its London-based LCH clearing house.  But pan-EU services provided from London by its Turquoise share trading platform, and TRADEecho trade reporting and UnaVista trade repository units could be disrupted if Britain crashed out of the bloc next March without a trading agreement.  \u201cWe can confirm that as part of our contingency planning for a hard Brexit scenario, Turquoise, TRADEcho and UnaVista have applied for a select number of additional licenses to continue to offer their services to EU-27 customers from Amsterdam,\u201d an LSE spokeswoman said.  STIFF COMPETITION  Cboe, which already has a stake in Amsterdam-based pan-European clearing house EuroCCP, said it had filed an application with the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets to establish an equities trading venue.  It said it needed to set up the new venue to ensure continued access to European clients after Brexit, but would still operate its existing Registered Investment Exchange in Britain and look to offer similar services on both venues.  Moves by Cboe and LSE mean that continental exchanges like Euronext ENX.PA, which has an arm in Amsterdam, and Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE in Frankfurt will continue to face stiff competition despite Brexit.  Cboe said its Amsterdam exchange would be staffed by a mix of local hires and staff moved from other locations, a spokeswoman said, without giving further details. It would be ready to serve European customers from April 2019.  It has around 80 staff in London, Hemsley told Reuters, adding the exchange picked Amsterdam over Dublin.  The announcements come as senior British politicians meet on Friday to agree their position on the shape of Britain\u2019s future relations with the bloc, and as many financial services firms continue to plan for a collapse in talks.  Pan-European Aquis Exchange AQX.L, which has just listed in London, said it had narrowed down plans for an EU base to two cities and would take a final decision in the next few months.  TP ICAP TCAPI.L, an interdealer broker, told staff on Tuesday it was speaking to a number of EU regulators about opening a subsidiary in the bloc.","253":"(Updates prices) * SPDR Gold holdings rise to highest since June 2013 * Better than expected Chinese trade data lifts stocks * Interactive graphic tracking the global spread: open tmsnrt.rs\/3aIRuz7 in an external browser By Brijesh Patel April 14 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose to their highest in more than seven years on Tuesday as concerns over global economic growth and a wave of stimulus measures from central banks and governments lifted bullion's appeal. Spot gold was up 0.4% at $1,721.54 per ounce at 1202 GMT, having touched its highest since November 2012. U.S. gold futures were steady at $1,761.80. Gold tends to benefit from widespread stimulus measures from central banks, as it is often seen as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Lower interest rates also cut the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. \"The flood of new money digitally printed by the central banks and huge debt pile by the states to fight the negative impact of the coronavirus (are) helping gold,\" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch \"Uncertainty (due to the virus) continues and supports the safe-haven demand, along with the continued huge inflow into the gold-backed exchange traded funds.\" Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest gold-backed ETF, rose to 1,009.70 tonnes on Monday, the highest since June 2013. Gold's rise came alongside gains in global equities after Chinese trade data came in better than expected and some countries tried to restart their economies by partly lifting restrictions aimed at containing the outbreak. Bullion has on occasion moved in tandem with stock markets this year, with recent sharp sell-offs prompting investors to sell precious metals to cover their losses elsewhere. Enough safe-haven demand remains for gold to counter pressure from any further weakness in stocks going into the company earnings season, said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen. Many nations have rolled out fiscal and monetary support to prop up their economies hit by the virus, which has infected more than 1.88 million people globally and killed 119,168. Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a $2.3 trillion stimulus package, while European Union finance ministers have agreed on half-a-trillion euros worth of economic support. A steep economic downturn and massive coronavirus rescue spending will nearly quadruple the fiscal 2020 U.S. budget deficit to a record $3.8 trillion, 18.7% of U.S. economic output, a Washington-based watchdog group said on Monday. Further supporting bullion, the dollar slipped against a basket major currencies. \"On the technical side, (gold) prices could jump higher towards $1,730 if a solid weekly close above $1,700 is achieved. Alternatively, sustained weakness below may... open the doors back towards $1,675,\" FXTM analysts said in a note. Other precious metals also rose, with palladium gaining 2.9% to $2,251.57 per ounce. Silver rose 0.6% to $15.54, and platinum climbed 3.1% to $771.22.

China\u2019s plan follows the opening of its iron ore futures to foreign investors in May, and would challenge iron ore options in Singapore, where the bulk of global trades is concentrated, as well as in New York.  It would follow China\u2019s launch of sugar and soymeal options last year and copper options which debuted just last week.  \u201cThe Dalian Commodity Exchange is still working on preparations for the iron ore options. But it won\u2019t take too long and could be launched by the end of 2019 at the latest,\u201d the source told Reuters, declining to be identified as the plan has not been approved by market regulators.  The Dalian Commodity Exchange and the China Securities Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment.  As a hedging tool, options would allow iron ore traders, miners and steel mills to manage price exposure, giving the buyer the right - but no obligation - to assume a futures position at a specified price.  The ability to carry out hedging trades could encourage more primary users to take part in the iron ore futures market, which traders say has been dominated by speculative investors who have deserted the market recently amid stagnant prices.  Iron ore options are mainly traded on the Singapore Exchange, with 1.77 million contracts, equal to 176.8 million tonnes, traded in January to August, exchange data showed. New York-based CME Group Inc also offers iron ore options.  The Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) allowed foreign investors to directly trade iron ore futures for the first time in May, hoping the most liquid iron ore derivative in the world would benefit from more institutional investors.  It was the second commodity that China opened to outside investors after the launch of crude oil futures in March.  But open contracts held by investors in Dalian iron ore futures fell to a 3-1\/2-year low on Tuesday, to 822,452 lots, and trading volumes nearly halved in August from May, which traders say shows that the bulk of the market remains in the hands of local speculators.  The source said he did not expect Chinese regulators to delay approval of DCE\u2019s iron ore options, as offering existing participants a new tool would have less risk than opening the futures market to overseas investors.

FILE PHOTO: Packages of Tyson food beef meat loaf are reflected in a mirror as they sit on a refrigerator for sale at a grocery store in Encinitas, California May 29, 2014. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Supermarkets are stocking up on steaks, hot dogs and hamburgers for the May 26 U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend, the start of the summer grilling season.  \u201cI think the consumer in the next 90 days is going to have a big opportunity to probably buy some beef fairly cheap,\u201d said Pete Bonds, owner of Bonds Ranch based near Fort Worth, Texas.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast surging numbers of steers and heifers ahead - further weakening prices for slaughter-ready, or cash, cattle while strengthening packer revenues.  \u201cWe\u2019ve basically got a wall of cattle to go through ... we\u2019re selling these cattle just as fast as we can get a bid,\u201d said Bonds.  HedgersEdge.com calculated that U.S. beef packers on Wednesday earned an estimated $236.90 per head of cattle processed, the highest this year. It had not topped $100 since November 2017 but is still shy of the record of $254.35 last June.  Some of the market conditions behind last year\u2019s record margins have again resurfaced: weaker live cattle futures, sharply lower cash cattle prices and rising wholesale beef values, said HedgersEdge.com analyst Bob Wilson.  Chicago Mercantile Exchange live cattle slid 22 percent from their Feb. 20 high to a low of $101.375 on March 17 in anticipation of larger supplies.  \u201cThe market is telling cattle feeders it wants those cattle to come to slaughter now,\u201d said Livestock Marketing Information Center senior economist Katelyn McCullock.  Analysts said the bulge of animals at feedlots is contributing to lower cattle returns.Last week cash cattle prices in the U.S. Plains averaged about $114.75 per hundredweight (cwt), $15 below this year\u2019s high for the week ended Feb. 17, according to USDA data.  For the week ending May 18 the USDA quoted wholesale choice-grade beef, which is preferred by cookout enthusiasts, at $231.93 per cwt, the year-to-date high.  McCullock said the surplus of cattle is moving through the system efficiently as packers capitalize on their impressive margins. Still, beef demand is critical for a consistent flow of cattle the through the pipeline, she said.  \u201cUltimately, it comes down to keeping up demand for cattle, not just heading into grilling season when beef demand is high, but also in the months following.\u201d","256":"(Adds more detail)  LONDON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - The European Union should provide clarity on when it will intervene in a foreign clearing house for derivatives to avoid potentially impeding cross-border co-ordination among supervisors, a senior U.S. regulator said on Thursday.  Dawn Stump, a commissioner at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said the EU should put more trust in the home regulators of foreign clearing houses or central counterparties (CCPs) that serve customers from the bloc.  \u201cWe must acknowledge that no single regulator is capable of overseeing markets in every corner of the world,\u201d Stump told a conference held by global derivatives industry body ISDA.  CCPs stand between two sides of a trade, ensuring its safe completion even if one side of the deal goes bust.  New EU rules would give the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), powers to directly supervise foreign clearing houses on their home turf in some instances.  U.S. regulators want the EU to \u201cdefer\u201d to a clearing house\u2019s home watchdog.  Stump said tests that ESMA will use for deciding when to intervene were \u201csubjective\u201d.  The CFTC has set out what Stump described as objective U.S. tests for determining when the CFTC should intervene in a clearing house based outside the United States.  Stump said cross-border regulation of clearing houses was a \u201ctwo-way street\u201d, based on trust and cooperation as set out at the Group of 20 economies (G20) Pittsburgh summit in 2009.  That summit was during the worst global financial crisis in decades and agreed on a requirement to clear as many derivatives contracts as possible to boost transparency.  This led to sharp growth in clearing houses that now handle trillions of dollars in contracts, making them a risk to financial stability if they got into trouble.  The EU has repeatedly defended its clearing house rules, saying they are similar to the U.S. system and are needed to ensure the bloc\u2019s financial stability in a crisis.  \u201cTrust and deference are critical for regulating cross border CCPs,\u201d Stump said.  The EU rules are largely aimed at London, home to the world\u2019s biggest clearing house LCH, ahead of Britain\u2019s departure from the EU.  But U.S. regulators are worried that large clearers based in the United States like ICE and CME could get snared as well.

Members of the group, including Citigroup Inc, C.N JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and BlackRock Inc BLK.N, published their views to try to shift in their favor prolonged policy debates over how clearinghouses should be fortified.  Regulators put clearinghouses at the center of trading in over-the-counter credit derivatives and interest rate swaps after the 2008 financial crisis. But the regulators have yet to agree on detailed protocols for shoring up, or safely winding down, clearinghouses wounded by customer defaults.  The task is arguably the biggest unfinished post-crisis reform and has become important as large clearing houses have become, like banks, too big to fail.  \u201cWe believe current capital requirements are insufficient,\u201d the group said in the white paper.  The clearinghouses, known as central counterparties, stand between both sides of trades and ensure their completion even if one side goes bust.  The clearinghouses were embraced after the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008 left a mess of unknown losses amid criss-crossed trades booked directly between each side.  Since then, clearing has become concentrated in a few clearinghouses primarily owned by the London Stock Exchange Group plc, LSE.L International Exchange Inc ICE.N and CME Group Inc CME.O. Most of the trades cleared through them come from about 10 big banks, known as clearing members and used by fund managers to take positions.  The banks and fund managers contend that the clearinghouses do not have enough of their own money at risk, leaving them with too little incentive to ensure effective risk management against defaults, operational failures and cyberattacks.  They also call for changes in governance rules to give clearing members more say in risks the clearinghouses may take on, such as clearing new instruments with unknown volatility.  Clearinghouses, in past comments to regulators and white papers of their own, have said that the banks should have a major responsibility for losses to prevent them from taking too much risk with trades and clients.  Clearinghouses were traditionally owned by their users. As investor-owned companies, they and their users have come in more conflict.  The banks are under increased pressure from regulations to limit how much capital they have at risk. Some of those rules have prompted some banks to back away from derivatives, which is a concern to fund managers who use them.  JPMorgan issued white papers on its own on clearinghouses in 2014 and 2017, but with limited success in moving policies.  Additional signers of Thursday's white paper were Allianz Global Investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, GS.N Societe Generale SA, SOGN.PA State Street Global Markets, T. Rowe Price Group Inc TROW.O and The Vanguard Group.","259":"(Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s suggestion on Tuesday that the country\u2019s stock exchanges might shorten their trading hours did not go over well with investors reeling from Wall Street\u2019s recent plunge sparked by growing fears about the coronavirus.

Rather, it could actually increase as investors turn to other venues outside the U.S. when developments occur.\u201d  Portfolio managers and traders cited potential problems in cutting trading hours, such as increasing the burden on electronic trading infrastructure and hurting the market\u2019s credibility, especially if it is perceived as a move to avoid further losses.  \u201cInvestors should feel as if the financial system is conducting business as usual,\u201d said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, in Florham Park, New Jersey.

The S&P 500 .SPX jumped 6% on Tuesday, rebounding from Monday's nearly 12% drop, which was the worst one-day decline since 1987. With the S&P 500 down 25% from its record high on Feb. 19, many investors have been unwilling to predict how much further Wall Street may fall.  On Friday, the NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N, issued a trader alert that it aims to keep its equity and options trading floors open \"in the days and weeks ahead.\"  \u201cWe absolutely believe in keeping the markets open,\u201d Mnuchin told reporters.  \u201cWe may get to a point where we shorten the hours, if that\u2019s something they need to do, but Americans should know that we are going to do everything that they have access to their money at their banks, to the money in their 401(k)s, and to the money in stocks,\u201d he added.  The last time the NYSE closed due to an unforeseen circumstance was in 2012 after Hurricane Sandy battered New York City.

He said SIX itself has been approached by bigger players looking for acquisitions.  The industry is in the process of widespread consolidation. Exchange operator CME Group CME.O agreed to buy Britain's NEX Group NXGN.L for $5.5 billion last month.  Dealmaking was not showing any signs of slowing, despite adaptation to new European market regulations MiFID II taking a chunk out of exchanges\u2019 profitability, said Dijsselhof, who took the helm at SIX in January.  Cross-Atlantic M&A may be coming back to the fore, he said, especially as big European mergers are more difficult due to competition rules.  Last year a planned merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse fell through due to regulatory concerns.  MIFID II COSTLY, BREXIT CAUSES HEADACHE  Adapting to the European Union\u2019s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), a sweeping regulatory change implemented at the start of this year, has been costly for many firms, said Dijsselhof.  \u201cEverybody has spent a lot of money on this, it has impacted profitability left right and centre. Even we have over-invested in projects in IT because of the regulation,\u201d he said.  But the increased need for investment into technology and systems to deal with reporting requirements could be an opportunity for SIX, he added, saying the exchange had seen a high take-up of MiFID reporting services.  The CEO said regulations have not always had the desired impact, noting some trading post-MiFID II has shifted from dark pools to bank-run systematic internalisers - dealing platforms which reveal much less information about impending transactions - instead of onto transparent exchanges.  \u201cOverly regulated markets are not good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to be contained to the core of where you want to protect the integrity and safety of the markets.\u201d  Ongoing negotiations between Britain and the European Union have led to another headache. The bloc has taken a more aggressive stance towards non-EU member Switzerland, and made the issue of equivalence - the bloc\u2019s approval of different regulatory regimes - more contentious, Dijsselhof said.  He called the EU\u2019s decision in December to grant SIX equivalence only on a one-year horizon \u201ctotally inappropriate\u201d, saying it creates unease among listed companies and hampers the free flow of capital.  Dijsselhof said he thought the EU was likely to try and impose a similar one-year limit on equivalence for UK companies, using it as a bargaining chip in negotiations, but he was confident the market would eventually win full equivalence.  \u201cThere\u2019s no way the EU will not make the UK equivalent. It will hurt them too much,\u201d he said.

Trading volumes for exchange operators tumbled in the final quarter of the year, compared to a year ago, when financial markets were rocked by volatility stemming from a trade dispute between the United States and China. (reut.rs\/3biolej)  Clearing and transaction fees, CME\u2019s biggest revenue stream, fell 13% to $901 million as the average daily volume slumped 19% to 16.9 million contracts.  Cost-cutting measures partly offset the hit to trading volumes. Total expenses fell 4% to $565.4 million.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $469.5 million, or $1.31 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $385.5 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intercontinental Exchange Inc said its new Permian West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures contract deliverable in Houston, Texas, will begin trading on Monday.  The trade month will be December and the contract will be deliverable at Magellan Midstream Partners LP\u2019s East Houston terminal, ICE said in a statement.  On Monday, ICE will list 36 months of flat-price Permian WTI contracts and calendar spreads, as well as inter-commodity spreads for the Houston contract versus Brent and the Houston contract versus WTI.  The primary U.S. futures contract is delivered at the storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, as has been the case since the contract was started in the early 1980s.  However, U.S. crude exports have surged after Washington lifted a decades-long ban, making Gulf Coast markets liquid and the sought-after destination for producers to send their barrels.  \u201cHouston has become the pricing center for U.S. crude oil production and exports, and the new Permian WTI futures contract is designed to serve hedging and trading opportunities in this growing market,\u201d ICE said in a statement.  The company first announced the contract in July, following which rival CME Group Inc said in September it would offer a new WTI Houston crude futures contract with three physical delivery locations on the Enterprise Products Partners LP\u2019s Houston system, beginning in the fourth quarter.","266":"LONDON (Reuters) - Exchange operator CME Group said on Wednesday it would launch a futures contract for liquefied natural gas (LNG) that is physically delivered at U.S. Cheniere Energy\u2019s Sabine Pass export terminal, a move likely to increase transparency in the market.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The contract, to be launched on Oct. 14, will have 24 delivery months, meaning a market participant in October could buy an August 2020 LNG cargo and trade it up until the delivery date.  It will help buyers to manage risk, giving them exposure to the fastest growing source of LNG supply while at the same time shedding light on physical and future LNG prices in an nascent and opaque market.  A number of other contracts have been launched in the past two years related to LNG and LNG shipping as supply of LNG and the infrastructure to both export and receive it has expanded rapidly.  The CME, the Intercontinental Exchange and PEGAS have launched futures and options priced against the Japanese Korea Marker which has been published by commodity pricing agency S&P Global Platts for a decade has become a benchmark for Asian LNG prices.  Most of the world\u2019s LNG is bought under bilateral contracts, some lasting as long as 20 years and linked to oil prices. The remaining 20% is traded on the spot market.  But LNG in the United States, which now has a 10% market share, has decoupled from the oil price and linked instead to Henry Hub natural gas in the country via supply contracts with Cheniere and some other producers.  These contracts also have flexible destination clauses which allow buyers to pick up their cargoes from the export terminals with their own ships and take them where they want, unlike conventional contracts which have a fixed delivery point.  These changes have created a disconnect in the global LNG marketplace which many traders exploit by taking advantage of geographical arbitrage and differences in oil and gas prices. Futures contracts can help mitigate those risks.  \u201cAs the world\u2019s largest buyer of LNG, we believe diverse risk management tools bring more transparency to the marketplace and we welcome CME Group\u2019s launch of physically delivered LNG futures,\u201d said Kazunori Kasai, CEO of JERA Global Markets, part of the world\u2019s largest LNG buyer, Japan\u2019s JERA.  \u201cWe expect CME Group\u2019s U.S. LNG Export futures contract will have a positive impact on the procurement and price discovery of LNG in Asia, as well as in the U.S,\u201d he said in a statement issued by CME announcing the contract.","267":"LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - The repackaging of loans to raise funds for companies has tumbled to its lowest rate since the financial crisis a decade ago, knocking back European Union efforts to deepen its capital market as Brexit looms.  The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) said public issuance of products that bundle loans into an interest-bearing security has fallen to 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) so far in 2019, the slowest start to the year since 2009.  The EU is building a Capital Markets Union (CMU) to raise more funds for companies and ease reliance on banks. Its executive European Commission updates on CMU on Friday.  The shift in market infrastructure by CME and CBOE from London to the EU this week to avoid disruption from Brexit is boosting CMU efforts, however.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear that having the biggest financial centre in the EU about to leave the single market, it\u2019s important that we develop, strengthen our own capital market, supervisory capacity and market infrastructure,\u201d a Commission official said.  \u201cIt\u2019s a question of being able to stand on our own two feet in terms of CMU while also being open to the world.\u201d  Securitisation was an early CMU reform of a sector that turned toxic in 2007 when asset-backed securities based on subprime U.S. home loans crashed, kickstarting a global financial crisis.  The EU created \u201csafe, transparent and standardised\u201d or STS products to restore confidence, but progress is slow.  \u201cThe delay in approval by the EU public authorities of key elements of the new securitisation framework is clearly a factor,\u201d said AFME, a banking trade body.  New rules forcing banks to hold cushions of assets that are easy to sell in a cash crunch are also \u201cunhelpful\u201d, AFME said. Only \u201cSTS\u201d products can be used but none can be eligible until the new framework is completed.  On Friday the Commission will focus on completing the 13 measures proposed, with nine agreed and two more reaching critical phases this week.  EU states and the European Parliament meet on Tuesday evening when they will try again to agree a draft law that strengthens EU-level supervision of markets.  Some countries worry about their own regulators losing power.  EU states and lawmakers also meet on Wednesday morning to agree a draft law that strengthens EU supervision of clearing houses, and the chances of a deal are seen as much higher.  It includes tougher requirements on foreign clearing houses like LCH in London after Brexit.  LCH dominates clearing of euro-denominated swaps, and the new requirements could ultimately mean that more euro clearing is done by rivals like Deutsche Boerse in the EU.","268":"(Adds company news items and futures)  Oct 31 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is seen opening 48 points higher at 7,084 on Wednesday, according to financial bookmakers, with FTSE 100 futures expected to be up 0.92 percent ahead of the cash market open.  * NEXT: British clothing retailer Next on Wednesday reported a slight slowdown in full-price sales growth in its third quarter but maintained its full-year profit guidance.  * WILLIAM HILL: British gaming and betting company William Hill Plc said on Wednesday that it offered to buy Sweden-based gaming company Mr Green & Co AB for SEK 2.82 billion ($307.40 million).  * INTU: Intu Properties Plc said on Wednesday that it had given a consortium led by its deputy chairman John Whittaker more time to make an offer for the shopping centre owner.  * NEX, CME: Britain\u2019s competition watchdog said it had cleared CME Group Inc\u2019s 3.9 billion pounds ($4.96 billion) deal to buy Michael Spencer\u2019s NEX Group Plc, paving the way for a cross-border trading powerhouse.  * GEM DIAMONDS: Gem Diamonds Ltd raised its full-year production target on Wednesday after reporting a 16.2 percent jump in diamonds found during the quarter, as demand and prices for white rough diamonds remained strong.  * JUST GROUP: British retirement services specialist Just Group on Wednesday posted a 17 percent year-on-year rise in third-quarter new business sales, boosted by demand from companies to offload pension-scheme risk.  * STANDARD CHARTERED: Standard Chartered reported on Wednesday a better than expected 31.3 percent rise in quarterly profit before tax, as the British lender attempts to bring down stubbornly high costs and boost flatlining revenues.  * RANDGOLD RESOURCES: Randgold Resources Ltd said on Tuesday its Loulo-Gounkoto gold mining complex in Mali had stepped up production, with increased grades expected in the third and fourth quarter of the year.  * GSK: A once-monthly injection to control HIV proved as effective as daily pills in a second study by GlaxoSmithKline, paving the way for a new regimen that could be simpler for some patients to be filed with regulators.  * SPORTS DIRECT: Sports Direct, the sportswear group controlled by retail tycoon Mike Ashley, has added to an already lengthy list of UK investments by snapping up specialist cycling retailer Evans Cycles.  * GOLD: Gold prices fell to a more than two-week low on Wednesday as Asian stocks gained and the dollar touched multi-month highs on upbeat U.S. economic data.  * OIL: Oil prices climbed for the first time in three days on Wednesday, but rising supply and fears over the outlook for demand amid the U.S.-China trade war kept pressure on the market.  * The UK blue chip index closed up 0.1 percent on Tuesday as strong update from BP helped the UK\u2019s top share index end a choppy session in the black, offsetting disappointing results from heavyweight Reckitt Benckiser and outperforming European equities.  * For more on the factors affecting European stocks, please click on: cpurl:\/\/apps.cp.\/cms\/?pageId=livemarkets  TODAY\u2019S UK PAPERS  > Financial Times  > Other business headlines (Reporting by Tanishaa Nadkar in Bengaluru)","269":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street could see sharp swings in trading after the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election. But there are safeguards in place to keep the stock market or equity futures from sliding out of control. Here is a guide to what exchanges do to halt trading if shares fall sharply.  FILE PHOTO: The Wall Street sign is pictured at the New York Stock exchange (NYSE) in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., March 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri  FUTURES MARKETS SAFEGUARDS  Price limits and circuit breakers are safeguards meant to stop a market from moving too far or too fast over a specific period of time, according to the CME Group CME.O, the world's biggest futures market operator.  In 2016, markets were betting on a win by Democrat Hillary Clinton and stock futures reacted violently here when it became clear late on election night that Republican challenger Donald Trump would become president.  S&P 500 futures ESc1, which trade on CME's Chicago Mercantile Exchange, plunged as investors scrambled to adjust positions. But once down 5%, the contract hit a price limit, meaning it could not trade lower, only sideways or up.  Price limits vary depending on the futures contract, but represent the maximum price range permitted for the contract to trade during each trading session.  CME\u2019s equity index futures price limits during the overnight session are now set at 7%, from 5% previously, either up or down.  Circuit breakers are a kind of price limit, but are more dynamic.  For U.S. equities futures, if a contract moves more than 3.5% up or down within a 60-minute period during the overnight session, trading is paused for two minutes to give market participants a chance to cancel, modify or place new orders, before reopening.  Once reopened, the rolling one-hour time frame resets and the next level of circuit breaker comes into effect, and so on, until the hard 7% price limit is reached.  STOCK MARKET SAFEGUARDS  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission mandated the creation of market-wide circuit breakers to prevent a repeat of the Oct. 19, 1987, market crash, when the Dow plunged 22.6%.  Current guidelines mandate a 15-minute market-wide pause in all U.S. stocks if the S&P 500 index falls more than 7% before 3:25 p.m. New York time.  Another circuit breaker kicks in if the index\u2019s decline hits 13% before 3:25 p.m., and trading is suspended for the session if the drop reaches 20%.  Circuit breakers were triggered here during the opening hour on March 9, 12 and 16 this year after the S&P 500 dropped 7% from its previous closing levels, and tripped later in the day on March 18, as coronavirus-driven volatility peaked.  WHAT IF AN EXCHANGE GOES DOWN?  On July 8, 2015, a technical glitch forced Intercontinental Exchange Inc's ICE.N New York Stock Exchange to suspend trading here for several hours. But trading continued as normal on the other 10 U.S. stock exchanges.  There are now 16 stock exchanges, as well as around 30 private stock trading venues run by broker dealers, where trading can take place.  In August 2013, a technical problem froze trading here in all Nasdaq-listed stocks for three hours, leading the SEC to call for a meeting of Wall Street executives to insure \"continuous and orderly\" functioning of the markets.  CAN THE ENTIRE MARKET BE SHUT DOWN?  On Oct. 29 and 30, 2012, markets were closed here after Superstorm Sandy, the worst storm to hit New York City in nearly 75 years. The NYSE closed its trading floor due to unsafe conditions in lower Manhattan.  The exchange had planned to go fully electronic, but with much of Wall Street unprepared for the transition and running on skeleton staffing, traders and regulators felt uncomfortable with the idea and it was shelved.  The markets have also closed due to other factors, including the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when markets were shuttered until Sept. 17 to avoid panic selling.  HOW PREPARED ARE STOCK EXCHANGES TODAY?  U.S. stock exchanges conduct regular testing of their systems, including for capacity and volatility issues.  Nearly all U.S. stock trading is done electronically, with only the NYSE still operating an open outcry trading floor for some trades. But the Big Board closed its floor for two months here at the outset of the pandemic and operated fully electronically without a hitch.  The SEC also introduced a rule called Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity in 2014 to hold exchanges to a higher level of accountability over emergency preparedness, and the bourses do regular testing of their backup facilities.","270":"LONDON (Reuters) - Regulators should scrutinize clearing houses and banks together to spot financial stability threats from the world\u2019s multi-trillion dollar derivatives market, the Bank for International Settlements said on Sunday.  The headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) are seen in Basel, Switzerland, December 15, 2016. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  Almost two-thirds of interest rate swaps pass through clearing houses like LICH LSE.L and Eurex DB1Gn.DE, ensuring the safe completion of trades even if one side of a transaction goes bust.  This compares with a fifth in 2009, before new rules were introduced in the aftermath of the financial crisis that require banks to clear trades to improve safety and transparency.  Banks and clearing houses are now regularly \u201cstress tested\u201d on an individual or sector-wide basis to check their resilience to defaults and extreme market stresses, but the BIS paper called for checks to be coordinated.  Clearing has cut risk in the financial system overall, but banks and clearing houses, also known as central counterparties (CCPs), could create a \u201cdestabilizing feedback loop\u201d that amplifies stresses in markets, said the BIS, a forum for central banks from across the world.  \u201cHence, the risks of banks and CCPs should be considered jointly, rather than in isolation,\u201d it said in its quarterly review.  Mandatory clearing has built up large exposures between a small number of banks and CCPs, or what the BIS calls a CCP-bank nexus that regulators should now be studying more closely.  Clearing houses are processing large notional values of interest rate and credit default swaps equivalent to 4.4 times the world\u2019s economic output, up from 2.8 times in 2008 when Lehman Brothers bank went bust.  Rules for clearing houses have already been tightened, and they must now be able to hold enough default funds to survive their two largest members going bust.  \u201cHowever, given the complex web of incentives, spanning different institutions and markets, what might transpire under some stress scenarios is less than fully understood,\u201d the BIS said.  Only three clearing houses have failed in the past 50 years, though some have come under severe stress.  A Norwegian power market trader racked up losses he could not cover in September, leaving commodities companies who are part of the Nasdaq clearing house and the exchange itself to plug a 114 million euro hole in a contingency fund.","271":"WASHINGTON\/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. banks and securities houses could be barred from trading on exchanges in the European Union if the bloc refuses to water down \u201cirresponsible\u201d proposals for regulating foreign clearing houses, a top U.S. regulator said on Wednesday.  J. Christopher Giancarlo Chairman, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, speaks at the Milken Institute 21st Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Christopher Giancarlo, chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), gave his strongest warning yet on possible retaliatory measures if EU regulators insist on close supervision of U.S.-based clearing houses under new rules.  \u201cIn my talks with European authorities, I have asked them to reconsider such an expansive approach,\u201d Giancarlo told a derivatives industry event in Chicago in a rare direct attack on another regulator.  The new rules, which the bloc aims to approve before Britain leaves the EU next March, would mean that \u201csystemic\u201d foreign clearing houses could only serve customers in the EU if European regulators can jointly supervise them.  Giancarlo said the CFTC will not allow the firms it regulates to comply with conflicting and overly burdensome regulation from abroad.  \u201cIf a satisfactory resolution of this situation cannot be found, the CFTC will have no choice but to consider a range of readily available steps to protect U.S. markets and market participants,\u201d Giancarlo said.  The CFTC has \u201cstrong and blunt\u201d tools it can deploy unilaterally as a last resort without new legislation, including the withdrawal of the exemptions that allow U.S. market participants to use trading platforms in the EU.  The watchdog has privately warned European officials that the bloc would suffer far more than the United States in an all-out clearing war because U.S. firms are much larger liquidity providers to European exchanges than vice versa, a person familiar with the discussions said.  The CFTC has so far received no indication from Brussels that it is willing to budge on its clearing proposal, despite the CFTC in recent weeks publicly pledging to move to a \u201cdeference\u201d model of regulators accepting each other\u2019s rules to avoid duplication, this person added.  Retaliatory action would be a last resort, this person said.  TARGET LONDON  The proposed EU rules were prompted by Britain\u2019s decision to leave the bloc next March, targeting a core activity that helps make the City of London a top global financial center.  LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange LSE.L, clears over 90 percent of euro-denominated interest rate swaps contracts used by companies to insure themselves against unexpected moves in borrowing costs.  But U.S. clearing houses like CME and ICE clear transactions for EU customers as well. Giancarlo said this would mean on-going EU surveillance and on-site inspections, with the bloc \u201cdictating\u201d board composition and corporate governance.  EU officials have said they want similar access to foreign clearing houses that the CFTC and the U.S. Federal Reserve have with LCH\u2019s dollar-denominated swaps clearing in London.  The CFTC has not given Brussels a deadline for responding but it does not anticipate that there would be much opportunity for the bloc to make changes once the EU legislation is passed in March, the same person said.","272":"March 29 (Reuters) - CME Group Inc:  * CME GROUP CFO SAYS LONDON WILL BE EUROPEAN HEADQUARTER OF COMBINED CO- CONF CALL  * CME GROUP CFO SAYS THERE WILL BE $285 MLN COST TO ACHIEVE SYNERGIES - CONF CALL  * CME GROUP SAYS THERE IS NO BREAKUP FEE IN THE AGREEMENT- CONF CALL  * CME GROUP SAYS TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE CME\u2019S INTERNATIONAL REVENUE BY OVER 35 PCT-CONF CALL","273":"(Reuters) - Several brokerages, including discount giant TD Ameritrade Corp AMTD.O are restricting customers from buying new positions in certain crude oil contracts after an unprecedented sell-off that sent prices below negative-$40 on Monday.  FILE PHOTO: A TD Ameritrade sign is seen outside a branch in Schaumburg, Illinois, U.S., October 24, 2016. REUTERS\/Jim Young  The U.S. oil futures market was rocked at the start of this week as a growing glut of supply and weak demand put fund managers and retail investors in the position of potentially having to take possession of thousands of barrels of crude that they would not be able to store anywhere.  That caused a panic that sent U.S. May futures CLc1, which expired on Tuesday, from $18 a barrel to a close of minus-$37.63, meaning sellers would have to pay buyers to take their barrels away.  TD Ameritrade told customers it would only allow closing trades in June and July U.S. crude futures contracts as well as in all U.S. crude options contracts.  \u201cWe made this decision based on the volatility and liquidity in the crude markets over the last week. This allows those markets to continue to return to their prior liquidity and volatility levels,\u201d said J.B. Mackenzie, managing director in futures and forex at TD Ameritrade.  Two other brokerages, London-based Marex Spectron and INTL FCStone, said they were limiting new positions being taken up after the high-volatility trading on Monday delivered big losses to holders of that contract.  Some retail investors lost substantial amounts of money. Interactive Brokers Group IBKR.O, another U.S. brokerage, said on Tuesday that it had to take an $88 million loss to cover accounts that had to be liquidated.  Some market participants have criticized exchange operator CME Group CME.O for allowing the contract to trade in negative territory.  CME Group said its markets worked as designed, with crude oil futures reflecting the unprecedented series of impacts from the coronavirus pandemic, including decreased demand for crude, global oversupply and tightening storage space.  \u201cCME Group accommodated negative futures prices ... on April 20 so that clients could manage their risk amid dramatic price moves, while also ensuring the convergence of futures and cash prices,\u201d a CME Group spokesman said, noting that the exchange had issued advisories in early April about such a possibility.  Crude markets have been under pressure all year. Saudi Arabia flooded markets with cheap oil in early March after it was unable to come to an agreement with Russia to curb output as the coronavirus pandemic worsened. The outbreak has killed more than 184,000 people worldwide and caused oil demand to collapse, dropping by an estimated 30% worldwide.  With storage tanks across the world filling fast, brokerages are imposing margin restrictions and limiting who can buy and sell the volatile front-month contracts.  Several sources at investment banks say they have not included such restrictions, but smaller companies have done so.  Marex restricted many of its customers from taking new positions in June WTI and Brent futures contracts and raised margin requirements, according to a spokesman. INTL FCStone also imposed restrictions, a spokesman confirmed.  \u201cGiven the extreme and unpredictable volatility in the markets, we are taking action to protect our smaller clients and make sure they are aware of the risks they are assuming,\u201d an INTL FCStone spokesman said in a statement.  Marex and INTL FCStone\u2019s moves were first reported by the Financial Times.  In addition, exchange-traded products such as the U.S. Oil Fund USO.P, which primarily holds crude oil futures contracts, have diversified into later-dated contracts to also avoid a squeeze.  The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude contract, when it expires, requires the holder to take delivery of crude in Cushing, Oklahoma.  As of last week, that facility, which has about 76 million barrels of working capacity, was about 76% full. However, most of the rest of the space has already been leased out by oil producers desperate for space, leaving funds without an avenue.  \u201cI had dozens of emails and phone calls from hedge funds,\u201d said Ernie Barsamian, chief executive of The Tank Tiger, a U.S. terminal storage clearinghouse. \u201cThey never really thought about the aspect of the physical delivery.\u201d","274":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s markets watchdog said on Tuesday it wants to keep stock markets open despite the extreme sell-offs seen in recent sessions, which have prompted some European countries to introduce trading curbs.  The watchdog also signalled more flexibility for traders who are executing stock transactions from back-up sites or from home.  \u201cOur aim is to continue to maintain open and orderly markets notwithstanding current volatility,\u201d the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in a statement.  Separately, the London Stock Exchange LSE.L said it has no plans to suspend trading as companies \"continue to need access to capital\", and will ensure that pricing of shares is conducted in a fair and transparent manner.  The FCA\u2019s U.S. counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission, said on Monday it would keep Wall Street open for trading despite a plunge in U.S. shares and speculation the government would shut down markets.  The FCA said it was ready to \u201ctake any steps necessary\u201d to ensure that customers are protected and that markets continue to function well.  Banks have already begun trading shares and other securities from split sites to minimise the potential for the coronavirus to spread among their staff.  This, and the prospect of traders having to execute transactions from home - which has yet to happen at major banks - has raised questions about meeting compliance requirements such as having equipment to record and track trades for regulators to spot any market abuses.  \u201cFirms should continue to record calls, but we accept that some scenarios may emerge where this is not possible,\u201d the FCA said. It had previously said that firms should continue to meet all compliance requirements like recording calls.  \u201cThis signifies a slight and sensible shift in approach,\u201d said Jake Green, a regulation partner at law firm Ashurst.

The populist trading rally, organized in online forums such as Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets, has helped attract a flood of retail cash into stocks such as GameStop, burned hedge funds that had bet against the stocks and roiled broader markets.  Here are five things to watch on Tuesday:  ** SILVER MARGINS - The rally in silver halted overnight with prices slipping back below $30 after CME Group raised Comex 5000 Silver Futures maintenance margins by 17.9%. Frankfurt-listed shares of GameStop, the trigger for the slugfest between amateur investors and Wall Street hedge funds last week, also plunged 37% at the open following a 19% slide on Monday.  ** BROKER CAPITAL - Robinhood, the easy access brokerage app which has fueled the trades, raised another $2.4 billion in funding on top of the $1 billion it raised last week after its finances were strained by the retail trading frenzy, but will that be enough?  ** SHORT OF SHORTS - The number of GameStop shares that were shorted fell by more than half last week as short sellers scrambled to cover their bets due to soaring valuations of stocks they had bet would fall. Still, GameStop short interest stood at $8.82 billion as of Friday, making it the sixth-biggest short by value, according to S3.  ** REDDIT FORUMS - WallStreetBets saw a surge in posts on Monday arguing that the bets on silver were undercutting their focus on GameStop and other popular stocks. Swings in the forum\u2019s almost 8 million participants may decide where the pack move next. ** BROADER MARKETS BOUNCE - The S&P 500, hit by the fallout of the battle last week, registered its biggest daily percentage gain since November on Monday. Still, the U.S. stock market which some analysts argue already looks overvalued after a stimulus-powered rally last year, was at risk of falling further if the short squeeze persists.

U.S. President Donald Trump stuck to his tough stance against top allies ahead of the summit on Friday and Saturday in Charlevoix, Quebec, after imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union last week. Trump's stand rekindled fears of a trade war that could harm economic growth worldwide, analysts said. \"Trade tension has been ramping back up. The synchronized global growth story which we have been speaking about since last year has frayed a bit,\" said Ilya Gofshteyn, global macro strategist at Standard Chartered in New York. Market activity had been modest before a spike in volume in the futures market coincided with a surge in bond prices in afternoon trading. At 1:34 p.m. (1734 GMT), the volume of 10-year Treasury futures began to jump, quadrupling in two minutes to 46,972 contracts. The price on the September 10-year T-note contract added 11\/32 to reach a session high of 120 before ending at 119-19\/32, up 10\/32 on the day, according to CME Group data. There was no market consensus behind the brief price and volume surge. Traders cited a range of explanations, including a slump in emerging market currencies, an erroneous order, or \"fat finger\" trade; and technical buying after the 10-year yield broke below the 2.92 percent level. In the cash market, benchmark 10-year Treasury notes' yield was down 4.5 basis points at 2.930 percent after hitting a four-day low at 2.884 percent. It reached a near two-week high at 2.994 percent earlier on Thursday. ECB, FED Trade concerns overshadowed speculation about the outcome of the European Central Bank's debate next week about ending the expansion of its 2.55 trillion-euro ($3 trillion) bond purchase program in September. Traders also waited for the U.S. Federal Reserve to signal how many times it would raise interest rates for the rest of 2018 as domestic labor conditions tighten and inflation moves closer to its 2 percent goal. \"If the ECB is not blinking on Italy, why should the Fed?\" said Aaron Kohli, interest rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York, said of Italy's recent struggle to form a government. Earlier on Thursday, the Labor Department said first-time filings for jobless benefits unexpectedly declined last week to 222,000. Traders widely expect the U.S. central bank to raise key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point to a 1.75 percent to 2.00 percent range next Wednesday. U.S. yields have retraced some of last week's steep drop tied to political turmoil in Italy. They had moved in step with their European counterparts on anxiety Italian ruling parties would implement economic policies that balloon the country's indebtedness and challenge rules to stay in the euro zone. \"With Italy more in the rear-view mirror, the view is that euro zone is still on relatively solid footing,\" Gofshteyn said. The 10-year German Bund yield edged up 0.6 basis point to 0.468 percent following a 9 basis-point jump the day before, which was its biggest one-day rise in nearly a year. This week's heavy supply of higher-yielding corporate bonds has supported Treasury yields, analysts said. So far this week, companies raised about $33.15 billion in the investment-grade bond market, according to IFR, a unit of Thomson Reuters. Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury Department said on Thursday it would sell a combined $68 billion in three-year, 10-year and 30-year securities next week.

Mark Hemsley, president of the European arm of U.S. exchange CBOE, said EU regulators were trying to map out future working relations with their UK counterparts after Britain leaves the bloc next March.  Brussels has proposed joint supervision of foreign clearing houses that want access to EU customers - or else clearing in euro-denominated contracts, currently dominated by LCH LSE.L in London, must relocate to the bloc.  This has raised concerns among regulators in the United States, where clearing houses handle dollar-denominated transactions for EU customers.  Hemsley, president of CBOE Europe, the region\u2019s biggest pan-European share trading platform and based in London, said the bloc must tread carefully.  Britain may take some elements of information sharing and cross supervision with EU regulators to win the \u201cprize\u201d of continued access to Europe, and European firms having access to the Britain, he said.  \u201cBut they have got to do that in a way that doesn\u2019t mean that the European regulators are going to try and regulate the DTCC, or CBOE US or CME because U.S. firms and regulators will say \u2018go jump, it\u2019s not going to happen\u2019,\u201d he told the annual FIA IDX derivatives conference.  The EU grants financial market access if it deems a foreign or \u201cthird country\u201d firm is complying with rules that are strict at those enforced in the bloc.  Brexit has prompted the bloc to review its equivalence regime as it was not intended for a foreign global financial center on its doorstep, as London will become after next March.  \u201cThat\u2019s the framework they are trying to work out. How do you manage a big third country without trying to reach into things which will never happen like regulating Japan, regulating the US,\u201d Hemsley said.  \u201cThen you\u2019ve got Switzerland, which is going to be probably a receiver in whatever happens in the UK environment.\u201d  The EU\u2019s euro clearing draft law builds on its equivalence system by including on-going supervision.

Clearing houses or central counterparties (CCPs) ensure a stock, bond or derivatives transaction is completed, even if one side of the trade goes bust.

Having an alternative clearing house in the euro zone would ensure no disruption in service for NEX customers if Britain were to crash out of the bloc without a deal.  The move by NEX, which is being taken over by U.S.-based CME Group, comes just a week after Deutsche Boerse announced plans to intensify competition with rival London Stock Exchange ahead of Brexit.

FILE PHOTO: A tray of bullion grade 2017 Sovereigns are seen at The Royal Mint, in Llantrisant, Wales, Britain, January 25, 2017. REUTERS\/Rebecca Naden\/File Photo  LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s Royal Mint has frozen plans to launch a digital gold token after a partnership with U.S. exchange group CME failed and the government vetoed a plan to have the tokens trade on a cryptocurrency exchange, three sources told Reuters.  The demise of the potentially ground-breaking project, named Royal Mint Gold (RMG), highlights the wariness of governments to become involved in the largely unregulated world of cyptocurrencies, which exploded into the public eye last year with the stellar rise of bitcoin.  As other mints and fintech startups race to set up similar products, it could squander the chances of Britain\u2019s Mint leading the field to build gold into a multi-billion dollar digital asset class.  It also reflects a cooling of enthusiasm toward digital assets at the CME, three sources said.  The project would have been the first time a government of a developed economy had become directly involved with a crypto currency exchange, analysts and traders said.  The 1,100-year old Mint announced its plan to issue tokens worth up to $1 billion on a blockchain-based trading platform run by CME in 2016, saying they would give investors an easy way to buy and trade physical gold held in its vaults.  Royal Mint Gold was to launch in the autumn of 2017, but CME decided at the last minute to pull out, leaving the Mint without a trading venue, sources said.  \u201cCME\u2019s management changed, and they walked away, didn\u2019t want to get involved,\u201d one of the sources said.  When a blindsided Mint sought to save the project by partnering with a cryptocurrency exchange, Britain\u2019s finance ministry in early 2018 refused to permit it, seeing the union as too big a gamble with the reputation of the government and the Mint, the sources added.  The Mint is 100 percent owned by the government.  Asked for comment, the Mint said its digital gold had been due to launch in spring this year. \u201cSadly, due to market conditions this did not prove possible at this time, but we will revisit this if and when market conditions are right,\u201d it said.  A Treasury spokesman referred Reuters\u2019 questions to the Mint. CME said it was \u201ccontinuing to assess client demand with our partner and have nothing new to report at this time.\u201d  Governments are wary of cryptocurrencies, and few international standards have emerged to tame extreme price volatility, regular thefts from exchanges and the risk that digital currencies could be used to launder money or finance terrorism.  In Britain cryptocurrency exchanges remain unregulated. Its finance ministry, central bank and financial watchdog are looking at whether rules are needed for cryptocurrencies and the use of blockchain technology in finance.  CHANGE IN STRATEGY  Gold is seen as a natural fit with cryptocurrencies because both assets attract investors looking for alternatives to state-sponsored monetary systems which they distrust.  The Mint\u2019s plan was similar to a type of digital money known as stable coins that are pegged to major currencies or other assets to avoid the volatility suffered by bitcoin and others.  The Mint had hoped to appeal to investors wanting digital assets but with the reassurance of a trusted issuer and to create a new revenue stream as use of mass circulation coins, its core business for more than a millennium, dwindles.  Royal Mint Gold also fit into a push by CME to develop digital asset classes and blockchain technologies. CME launched bitcoin futures contracts last year, one of the first to do so, and has invested in digital technology startups through a ventures arm.  But CME\u2019s priorities shifted after CEO Phupinder Gill retired in late 2016 and Sandra Ro, CME\u2019s head of digitization, left in July 2017, sources said.  \u201cThere was a change in strategy,\u201d said one source, adding that digitization was de-emphasized.  Asked to comment, CME said: \u201cIt is not correct to say we have \u2018de-emphasized\u2019 digitization and remain committed to pursuing our digitization strategy.\u201d  After the government vetoed the plan to trade Royal Mint Gold on a crypto exchange, the Mint\u2019s new chief executive Anne Jessop, appointed in February 2018, decided to shut the project down, the sources said.  Around four staff in London were let go in March and a further 7-8 lost in Wales, where the Mint is also based, in May. The project is now frozen, the sources said.  Meanwhile, others are launching rival products.  Australia\u2019s Perth Mint and the Royal Canadian Mint are involved with digital gold products that launched this year and trade using technology supplied by fintech startups. Both mints declined to say how much gold had been bought through these platforms.  Gold-backed cryptocurrencies have also proliferated, though none has yet achieved the success of cryptos such as bitcoin, Etherium and Ripple, which have attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in investment.","287":"ZURICH, June 24 (Reuters) - The Swiss government said on Monday it was ready to ban stock exchanges in the European Union from trading Swiss shares - intensifying a row over a stalled partnership treaty.

Moss Brothers and Kingfisher on Wednesday became the latest in the sector to suffer dramatic share price declines after reporting deteriorating trading.  The sector appears rife with \u201cvalue traps\u201d - stocks that appear cheap but turn out to undershoot even the most pessimistic expectations - partly because online rivals are peeling away the core customers of retail businesses that need reliable cashflows to service their debts.  Yet some investors are daring to dip in to consumer-facing stocks, from mid-caps to the smallest listed companies, saying valuations have been marked down in a blanket way and some now look like bargains.  \u201cDespite there being all these headwinds, all these problems, there are still one or two interesting investments out there,\u201d said Phil Harris, manager of the UK equity growth fund at EdenTree Investment Management.  \u201cThey\u2019re just quite hard to find.\u201d  Sentiment on UK equities as a whole reached a new all-time low in March, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s fund manager survey showed on Tuesday.  That day, e-commerce giant Amazon.com, bane of the traditional bricks-and-mortar retailer, leapfrogged Google owner Alphabet to become the world\u2019s second-biggest company by market value.  British retail stocks, the most exposed to domestic consumers, are the least preferred within an already unpopular asset class and have had an especially brutal start to the year.  Toys R Us UK and Maplin entered administration at the end of February, while early-years retailer Mothercare fell to an all-time low.  Carpetright, seen as a bellwether of consumers\u2019 spending on home improvement, warned on profits for the third time in four months in March and is raising capital in a bid to turn things around.  Department store chain Debenhams kicked off the year with a profit warning and its shares are at their lowest since the financial crisis.  The retail sector index fell to its lowest level since the 2016 Brexit vote aftermath on Wednesday.  In such a climate, it\u2019s lonely being an investor in UK retail stocks.  Paul Mumford, UK equities fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management, is one of these. He\u2019s sticking with his holding in Moss Brothers despite the stock plummeting 20 percent, saying it has a decent online business and its balance sheet is \u201cfine\u201d.  BARGAIN-HUNTING IN HATED MARKET  Mumford may be joined by others looking for companies that could turn out to be a bargain if they can withstand the headwinds buffeting the industry.  \u201cWe are actually getting quite interested in the UK because it\u2019s hated, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s biggest underweight,\u201d said Rory McPherson, investment director at Psigma Investment Management.  While there are many more \u201cland mines\u201d than in the past, as Hawksmoor fund manager Daniel Lockyer put it, some are seeing opportunities.  Pessimism has driven valuations down so far that they\u2019re attracting bargain hunters.  \u201cClients are asking about mid and small caps because they want to get those value areas where things have underperformed,\u201d said Sharon Bell, European equity strategist at Goldman Sachs.  And a transition deal agreed with the EU on Monday has rekindled interest in the UK market.  Stocks across the retail sector have seen significant levels of short interest \u2013 bets against a company \u2013 in recent years, denting share prices.  One of these is Debenhams, a stock many have shunned for years as the shift to online shopping gathers pace. It\u2019s another of Mumford\u2019s holdings.  \u201cAt this level, the shares are saying the company is high risk, but the price might be considered artificially low having been dragged down by short selling,\u201d said Mumford, adding it was a \u201cdouble or nothing\u201d situation.  Others are more cautious.  \u201cI have steered clear because optically they can look very cheap, but particularly retail stocks are very operationally geared and it only takes a small downturn in trading to make a material impact on earnings,\u201d said EdenTree\u2019s Harris.  Hawksmoor\u2019s Lockyer sees Debenhams, in particular, as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.  Some are looking at stocks which could gain from consumers\u2019 shrinking spending power as they opt for cheaper products.  Laura Foll, fund manager at Janus Henderson Investors, has a holding in Shoe Zone which has been able to maintain stable levels of sales thanks to its budget-friendly offering.  DISRUPTED NOT JUST BY BREXIT  Disruptions to retail across the globe are also visible in Britain. Consumers are visiting stores less, enjoying price transparency thanks to the \u201cinfinite shelf\u201d of the Internet and the dominance of Amazon, and favouring experiences over objects.

The extent of the damage that the coronavirus pandemic had inflicted on the oil industry came into focus on April 20, when the U.S. benchmark WTI contract plunged to minus $38 a barrel.  The virus destroyed so much fuel demand as billions of people stopped traveling that there was almost nowhere left to store the oil. So on the day before the May contract expired, investors stuck with barrels had to pay buyers to take it away.  A month later, governments around the world are slowly lifting travel restrictions and there are signs that demand is recovering from its nadir. Oil prices have staged something of a recovery, with U.S. crude at nearly $30 a barrel.  As oil producers worldwide cut output rapidly, the pressure on storage is easing: U.S. government data this week showed crude inventories fell.  \u201cThere\u2019s clearly a different feel to the oil market heading into this contract expiry, with production cuts having been enforced globally, either through deals or unilaterally,\u201d said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.  \u201cBut will it be enough to avert another panic selling moment? The odds have certainly reduced ... there\u2019s a fine line between confidence and complacency and we can only hope that line hasn\u2019t been crossed or early next week it could quickly unravel.\u201d  Still, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that oversees futures and options trading, issued a rare warning on Wednesday to exchange operators and brokerages ahead of expiry, telling them they need to protect markets from manipulation and potentially intervene to protect customers.  Several brokerages or futures commission merchants (FCMs), including discount giant TD Ameritrade Corp, have restricted customers from buying new positions in some crude contracts since the price crash.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which hosts the trade in WTI futures, last week raised maintenance margins for the June contract by 20%. That would make it too expensive for some smaller retail investors to hold many open positions ahead of expiry.  Asked about CME\u2019s expectations, a spokesperson said the exchange would not speculate on whether prices will be negative for any product and referred Reuters to notices about its systems\u2019 ability to accommodate negative pricing.  Last month, the CME ordered the United States Oil Fund LP , the largest oil-focused exchange-traded product in the country, to limit its position in the June contract to no more than 10,000 lots. The fund has issued filings to tell investors it has gone further than that - and has spread holdings through contracts expiring in July, August and September.  Open interest in June is already dwindling as a result of those moves, standing at about 75,000 lots on Thursday, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. That was down from nearly 135,000 lots on Wednesday.  On April 17, two days before the May contract expired, open interest stood at about 108,600 lots.  PLUNGE AFTERMATH  The WTI contract is physically settled, meaning the holder at expiry must take delivery of the oil in Cushing, Oklahoma. Retail investors keen to take a punt on oil prices through futures contracts have no interest in actually owning barrels of real crude.  Last month, retail investors got caught holding contracts close to expiry when buyers were scarce and storage at Cushing was effectively full, sending them into a frenzy to sell.  \u201cBluntly, small retail traders had no business being in the May contract at that time,\u201d said Henry Lichtenstein and Brett Friedman at risk management advisors Winhall Risk Analytics. Those traders\u2019 FCMs, the exchange or the CFTC should have stepped in and prohibited them from trading, they said.  \u201cThis would have avoided a financial effect on futures traders due to the allowance of negative prices that we conservatively estimate in the $3.8 billion range.\u201d  The mess last month threatened the contract\u2019s status as one of the two top global oil price gauges, according to Patricia Hemsworth, senior vice president of energy risk management at PGM Commodity Services.  \u201cI believe the debacle of the May delivery threatened a benchmark which has provided the industry with an invaluable price discovery and risk transfer tool for 37 years,\u201d she said.  Among those impacted were investors in derivatives contracts based on the WTI that are traded on exchanges as far afield as China and Russia.  Bank of China (BoC) said it had hired lawyers to write to the CME urging it to investigate reasons behind abnormal fluctuations on April 21. Retail investors may have lost more than 9 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) from BoC\u2019s crude oil product, financial news outlet Caixin reported last month, citing unnamed sources.  Another factor that could help avoid a repeat of the crunch this month is that inventories at Cushing have begun to decline, falling by 3 million barrels last week, U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed. That should free up some space for those taking delivery of the June contract.  In physical markets, the forum for buying and selling actual oil rather than futures contracts, activity slowed down ahead of expiry. Physical deals are usually priced based on the benchmark and traders are keen to avoid exposure to any volatility ahead of expiry.  \u201cProducers are hesitant to sell for June,\u201d one trading source at a U.S. producer said.  \u201cI\u2019m done for June at the moment.\u201d","291":"March 2 (Reuters) - Cme Group Inc:  * CME GROUP REACHES HIGHEST-EVER MONTHLY VOLUME OF 27.3 MILLION CONTRACTS FOR FEBRUARY 2018  * CME GROUP INC - FEBRUARY 2018 E-MINI DOW FUTURES ADV, UP 181 PERCENT TO 348,000 CONTRACTS  * CME GROUP INC - EQUITY INDEX VOLUME AVERAGED 4.9 MILLION CONTRACTS PER DAY IN FEB 2018, UP 93 PERCENT FROM FEB 2017  * CME GROUP INC - OPTIONS VOLUME AVERAGED 6.1 MILLION CONTRACTS PER DAY IN FEBRUARY 2018, UP 59 PERCENT FROM FEBRUARY 2017  * CME GROUP INC - ENERGY VOLUME AVERAGED 2.8 MILLION CONTRACTS PER DAY IN FEB 2018, UP 13 PERCENT FROM FEB 2017  * CME GROUP INC - METALS VOLUME AVERAGED 690,000 CONTRACTS PER DAY IN FEBRUARY 2018, UP 32 PERCENT FROM FEBRUARY 2017 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Brief@thomsonreuters.com)","292":"(Adds responses from the companies)  Jan 21 (Reuters) - Magellan Midstream and Enterprise Products plan to combine forces to develop a futures contract for the physical delivery of crude oil in the Houston area, after two years of separately working on contracts with exchanges.

Quality specifications will be consistent with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil originating from the Permian Basin, with delivery capabilities at either Magellan\u2019s East Houston terminal or Enterprise\u2019s ECHO terminal.

If it receives a positive market response and encouraging test results, ICE said it would launch the index in the first quarter of 2020.  LIBOR, or the London interbank offered rate, gauges what banks say they would charge each other to borrow dollars. It is the benchmark for $200 trillion in dollar-denominated financial products, mostly in interest rate swap contracts.  But LIBOR\u2019s reputation as the market standard has been tainted in the wake of rigging scandals by traders, which resulted in billions of fines for major global banks, including Deutsche Bank.  Regulators set LIBOR to be phased out in 2021 and have encouraged alternatives to take its place.  Last April, the New York Federal Reserve and the Office of Financial Research, an independent agency at the U.S. Treasury, launched the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR) as a LIBOR alternative.  A handful of companies have begun issuing floating-rate bonds using SOFR as a rate reference, and trading of futures based SOFR has increased. But SOFR has not yet been widely adopted.

But such measures would be aimed at facilitating \u201ca transition to achieving sufficient capacity within the EU\u201d, the document said.

A senior UK regulator has said privately that persuading its counterpart, the European Central Bank, to back EU action publicly is proving to be very hard.  The BoE wants Brussels to mirror measures that Britain is taking to ease market concerns by allowing cross-border clearing to continue, and for derivatives and insurance contracts to remain valid in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  But EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said last week that the priority is for the EU and Britain to agree on a divorce settlement and transition period, which would do away with the need for no-Brexit deal measures.  Britain and EU leaders failed to make sufficient progress at a summit last week, and future arrangements for the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland remain a major sticking point.  The document said that the risk of a no-deal Brexit to financial stability has \u201calready diminished significantly\u201d as banks and insurers adjust contracts or move activities to new hubs in the EU.

Manufacturing activity has rebounded faster than anywhere else and China\u2019s imports of metals such as copper and aluminium have been running at record highs.  The divergence with the rest of the world is also clear in last year\u2019s global base metals trading patterns.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) saw volumes surge as industrial activity bounced back from early-year lockdowns. Trading action on the London Metal Exchange (LME), by contrast, fell hard over the second half of the year causing full-year volumes to drop 7%.  It was the second consecutive year of decline for the 144-year old London market after a 2% fall in 2019, but the grand old dame of metals trading is winning share in new markets such as steel.  More new LME contracts are expected and the volumes battle between London, Shanghai and the CME in the United States looks set to intensify this year.  TRADING THE COVID-19 RECOVERY  Global metals trading last year ebbed and flowed with the spread of the novel coronavirus.  Copper, one of the most actively traded industrial metals, highlights the disconnect between China and everywhere else.  Shanghai copper volumes fell heavily in the first quarter of 2020, when China went into lockdown, but grew rapidly over the second half of the year, by the end of which they were up by 57% on 2019 levels and the highest since 2016.  Copper action on both the LME and the CME followed an inverse pattern, up strongly in the first quarter before slumping in the second as lockdowns spread to the rest of the world. Volumes remained humdrum over the second half of the year, even while the ShFE saw a surge of activity as Chinese investors bought into the country\u2019s recovery story.  LME copper volumes fell by 2% over 2020, while those on the CME were up by just 0.3%.  It is clear that copper\u2019s recovery from $4,371 per tonne in March to over $8,000 has been largely made and traded in China.  This desynchronised trading pattern played out across the metallic spectrum.  All the ShFE metals contracts recorded strong volume growth last year with the exception of zinc (down 15%) and steel rebar (down 21%).  The stand-out was the Shanghai tin contract, which saw activity mushroom to 13.3 million lots from 3.2 million in 2019, suggesting the tiny tin market has moved onto the broader investment radar in China.  PRICES UP BUT VOLUMES DOWN ON LME  LME volumes jumped in the first quarter of 2020 before registering ever steeper year-on-year falls over the second half.  Average daily volumes in December were down by 20.5% on last year, not including UNA trades, a compliance work-around whose popularity has dwindled since the exchange stopped making it a free service.  The sharp drop-off in trading activity over the second half of 2020 coincided with the super-charged rally in base metal prices, suggesting a collective lack of buy-in from industrial players in what remains their primary hedging forum.  This is not surprising, given the disruptive effect on the manufacturing sector outside China from second and third wave COVID-19 outbreaks and associated lockdowns.  Over the full year only two of the LME\u2019s established contracts - steel rebar and aluminium - registered any increase in volumes and then only a small 4% and 1% respectively.  The sharpest drops were seen in the two aluminium alloy contracts, a niche market that looks in danger of disappearing altogether as activity and registered stocks spiral lower.  However, last year wasn\u2019t all bad news for the LME.  The exchange\u2019s creep into the steel sector continued apace The new China hot-rolled-coil (HRC) contract fared particularly well in its first full year of trading with volumes of 93,514 contracts, up from 38,090 in 2019.  The LME will launch three more steel contracts in June this year for the European HRC market and the Indian and Taiwanese scrap markets.  So far at least, the LME\u2019s incursions into ferrous trading haven\u2019t been at the expense of the CME. Volumes on the U.S. exchange\u2019s HRC contract rose by 27% last year, while activity on its scrap contract more than doubled, suggesting a mutually-beneficial arbitrage link.  EXCHANGE BATTLE HEATS UP  In other parts of the industrial metal markets, however, exchange trading is becoming more fractured.  Aluminium premium trading, for example, seems to have found its home on the CME, which registered volume growth across all four regional products last year.  The LME\u2019s belated attempt to muscle in has so yielded little with its U.S. premium contract notching up just 368 lots in its first full year of trading. The exchange is undeterred with a new contract for European premiums also due in June.  Electric vehicle metals look set to be the next battle-ground for the two exchanges.  The CME launched a cobalt contract in December in what looks like a direct challenge to the LME for trading this battery metal. Volumes in the LME\u2019s physically-deliverable cobalt contract slumped by 86% to just 1,331 contracts, while the newer cash-settled contract did not trade last year.  An LME lithium contract, also due in June this year, opens up a new front in the battle, although it remains to be seen if the exchange has won over the lithium supply chain to the concept of benchmark futures pricing.  Looming ever larger in this fight for metals market share is the ShFE.  Its new \u201cinternational\u201d copper contract, deliverable against metal sitting in Shanghai\u2019s bonded warehouse zone, is traded on ShFE subsidiary the International Energy Exchange.  Trading began in November and grew to 476,334 lots in December with open interest almost doubling to 20,809 lots at the end of the month.  Whether ShFE\u2019s move to step out of the Chinese mainland market into international waters is disruptive or complementary to the LME and CME remains to be seen.  At the very least, the new copper contract seems likely to emerge as a regional pricing hub, creating a further fracturing of what was once an LME-dominant metals trading landscape.","306":"PARIS (Reuters) - Active trading in CME Group\u2019s new cash-settled futures for Black Sea grain suggests the exchange may have found a way to tap into booming Black Sea export trade after an unsuccessful earlier foray in the region.  A man enters the CME Group offices in New York, U.S., October 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The derivatives, based on S&P Global Platts\u2019 price benchmarks for Russian wheat and Ukrainian corn, have generated more than over 15,000 lots representing 750,000 tonnes of grain since their December launch, in stark contrast to CME\u2019s illiquid Black Sea wheat contract <0#BSW:> with physical delivery dating back to 2012.  Record Russian wheat exports this season have cemented the role of the Black Sea region as a driver of global grain prices and trade.  CME\u2019s new wheat futures <0#BWF:> are seen as having the biggest potential given Russia\u2019s clout as the world\u2019s largest wheat exporter, and they have so far generated over 14,000 lots traded compared to 1,400 for corn.  Ukraine is the world\u2019s fourth-largest corn (maize) exporter.  The cash-settled system of the new futures is a draw for participants keen to avoid the constraints of physical delivery.  The possibility of off-screen block trades, meanwhile, has allowed CME to tap into existing over-the-counter (OTC) trading, with the guarantee of exchange clearing to remove counterparty risk.  Platts says its physical price benchmarks for Black Sea grain and Australian wheat already generated some 500,000 tonnes in OTC trading in the year preceding the launch of the Black Sea futures with CME.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very good start,\u201d said Arnaud Saulais of SCB & Associates, one of the firms brokering the new futures. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing participants who didn\u2019t want to trade OTC and are now starting to do these cleared swaps.\u201d  Price assessments like Platts\u2019, compiled using observed physical market levels, also appeal to traders who cite a weakening correlation between Black Sea prices and CME\u2019s Chicago wheat <0#W:> and corn <0#C:>, or Euronext\u2019s French-based wheat contract.  Euronext has said it is considering possibilities for developing Black Sea grain derivatives.  CME\u2019s Black Sea futures, like its Australian wheat contract with Platts, offer the choice between striking bilateral block trades that are then cleared via CME Clearport, or trading via the Globex screen platform as with its flagship Chicago futures.  The exclusively block-trade activity so far has allowed CME to avoid the trap of inactive screen trade. But some argue it will have to capture screen trading in order to be a credible alternative to its Chicago grain futures with hundreds of thousands of lots traded daily, or Euronext\u2019s tens of thousands.  \u201cRight now, Clearport and block trades are doing the job,\u201d said Matt Ammermann, commodity risk manager at INTL FC Stone, another brokerage handling the new futures.  \u201cBut to my mind it\u2019s very inefficient. It should be all on the screen so everyone can react.\u201d","307":"March 29 (Reuters) - CME Group Inc:  * OFFER FOR NEX GROUP PLC  * CME AND NEX HAVE REACHED AGREEMENT ON TERMS OF A RECOMMENDED ACQUISITION WHEREBY ENTIRE ISSUED AND TO BE ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL OF NEX  * UNDER TERMS OF ACQUISITION, NEX SHAREHOLDERS WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE: FOR EACH NEX SHARE 500 PENCE IN CASH AND 0.0444 NEW CME SHARES  * CME BOARD BELIEVES THERE IS A COMPELLING STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL RATIONALE FOR UNDERTAKING ACQUISITION  * CME BOARD EXPECTS ACQUISITION TO GENERATE RUN RATE COST SYNERGIES OF $200 MILLION, WHICH ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE FULLY ACHIEVED BY END OF 2021  * IN ADDITION TO EXPECTED COST SYNERGIES, THERE ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE COMPELLING REVENUE GROWTH  * NEX\u2019S HEADQUARTERS WILL BE COMBINED WITH CME\u2019S, AND COMBINED COMPANY\u2019S HEADQUARTERS WILL BE LOCATED AT CME\u2019S HEAD OFFICE IN CHICAGO Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","308":"LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Regulators should scrutinise clearing houses and banks together to spot financial stability threats from the world\u2019s multi-trillion dollar derivatives market, the Bank for International Settlements said on Sunday.  Almost two-thirds of interest rate swaps pass through clearing houses like LCH and Eurex, ensuring the safe completion of trades even if one side of a transaction goes bust.  This compares with a fifth in 2009, before new rules were introduced in the aftermath of the financial crisis that require banks to clear trades to improve safety and transparency.  Banks and clearing houses are now regularly \u201cstress tested\u201d on an individual or sector-wide basis to check their resilience to defaults and extreme market stresses, but the BIS paper called for checks to be coordinated.  Clearing has cut risk in the financial system overall, but banks and clearing houses, also known as central counterparties (CCPs), could create a \u201cdestabilising feedback loop\u201d that amplifies stresses in markets, said the BIS, a forum for central banks from across the world.  \u201cHence, the risks of banks and CCPs should be considered jointly, rather than in isolation,\u201d it said in its quarterly review.  Mandatory clearing has built up large exposures between a small number of banks and CCPs, or what the BIS calls a CCP-bank nexus that regulators should now be studying more closely.  Clearing houses are processing large notional values of interest rate and credit default swaps equivalent to 4.4 times the world\u2019s economic output, up from 2.8 times in 2008 when Lehman Brothers bank went bust.  Rules for clearing houses have already been tightened, and they must now be able to hold enough default funds to survive their two largest members going bust.  \u201cHowever, given the complex web of incentives, spanning different instutitions and markets, what might transpire under some stress scenarios is less than fully understood,\u201d the BIS said.  Only three clearing houses have failed in the past 50 years, though some have come under severe stress.  A Norwegian power market trader racked up losses he could not cover in September, leaving commodities companies who are part of the Nasdaq clearing house and the exchange itself to plug a 114 million euro hole in a contingency fund.","309":"(Adds company news item, futures)  March 29 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is seen opening 20 points lower at 7,025 on Thursday, according to financial bookmakers, with futures down 0.40 percent ahead of the cash market open.  * CME\/NEX: U.S. exchange operator CME Group said it had reached an agreement to buy Michael Spencer\u2019s NEX Group, valuing the British company at about 3.9 billion pounds ($5.49 billion) and creating a cross-border trading powerhouse.  * CONVIVIALITY: British drinks wholesaler Conviviality said on Thursday it was likely to appoint administrators to the business within two weeks, putting around 2,600 jobs at risk.  * CHESNARA: Chesnara Plc, an insurance-focused takeover specialist, reported on Thursday a surge in full-year pretax profit, driven by strength in its domestic business and gains from its acquisition of Legal & General\u2019s Dutch insurance business.  * SHIRE: Japan\u2019s largest drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical is considering a bid for London-listed rare disease specialist Shire that could top $40 billion and spark another takeover battle in the deal-hungry pharma industry.  * RECKITT BENCKISER: Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s chief executive Rakesh Kapoor got an 18 percent pay cut in 2017, his second in two years, due to a halving of his long-term incentive benefits, after a year of underperformance at the British consumer goods company.  * GKN\/MELROSE: The three-month battle for GKN will be decided on Thursday when the deadline for shareholders to accept Melrose Industries\u2019s 8 billion pound ($11 billion) hostile bid expires, ending one of the most closely-contested takeover fights in Britain for years.  * GSK\/TEVA: A federal judge on Wednesday overturned a U.S. jury\u2019s verdict that required Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd to pay GlaxoSmithKline Plc more than $235 million for infringing a patent covering its blood pressure drug Coreg.  * UK CAR OUTPUT: British car production fell 4.4 percent in February, dragged down by the seventh consecutive monthly decline in domestic demand as sales in Europe\u2019s second biggest car market continue to slump, an industry body said on Thursday.  * EX-DIVS: British Land, Intercontinental Hotel Group and Prudential will trade without entitlement to their latest dividend pay-out on Thursday, trimming 3.88 points off the FTSE 100 according to Reuters calculations.  * The UK blue chip index closed up 0.6 percent at 7,044.74 points on Wednesday, shaking off broader concerns over the U.S. tech sector that rattled global equity markets.

Details of the $1 per OTC contract fee in an LME statement on Thursday were largely in line with a consultation about the fee it held in recent months, although it delayed imposing the fee for two months.  The exchange, the world\u2019s oldest and largest market for industrial metals, had previously planned the fee from April 3.  \u201cWe are confident that the proposal is transparent, fair and non-discriminatory,\u201d Adrian Farnham, chief executive of LME Clear, the exchange\u2019s clearing house, said in a statement.  The LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. , announced the OTC fee in September, designed to help balance the loss of income from cuts for other exchange fees aimed to help reverse declining volumes.  LME revenue last year from trading fees and tariffs fell 9 percent to HK$1.1 billion ($141 million) while overall volumes for the year rose by just 1 percent, HKEX said on Wednesday when releasing its results.  The $1 per OTC contract charge aims to narrow the cost difference between trading on the LME and over the counter, where volumes grew rapidly after the exchange raised fees by 31 percent on average in 2015.  Some users have warned the fee could reduce trading or push business to other venues such as the CME or NFEx, a new platform due to launch this year.  To address those concerns, the LME decided to narrow the scope of the fee to include roughly only half of an estimated 20 million OTC trades a year, which would earn it about $10 million a year.  The new OTC fee policy excludes structured products and financing trades.  \u201cWe were particularly pleased that client feedback to the consultation suggested that the new financial OTC booking fee would not significantly impact their trading activities,\u201d Farnham said.","311":"LONDON (Reuters) - Amid frenzied selling in financial markets this week, there was a silver lining for banks and trading platforms which attracted a rush of business as investors scrambled to protect portfolios from the volatility.  The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seen in New York City, New York, U.S., March 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly  European stock trading volumes swelled on Monday to more than three times their 90-day daily average, according to Refinitiv data, as share prices suffered their biggest one-day drop since the 2008 financial crisis and oil prices plunged 25%.  Ten days into March, European share trading volumes have already hit more than half their February total, Refinitiv data shows.  The resurgence will be welcomed by traders. London-based inter-dealer broker TP ICAP TCAPI.L, for instance, has seen record-breaking volumes during the past fortnight's selloff, CEO Nicolas Breteau told Reuters on Tuesday.  \u201cWe had reached record volumes, with clients hedging, rebalancing their portfolios ... a lot of intense activity,\u201d Breteau said, adding that while the environment affected clients, the volatility offered TP ICAP an opportunity that \u201cgives us confidence for the future.\u201d  Before March, trading desks at banks and elsewhere had suffered a prolonged period of low volatility and lacklustre volumes, crimping profitability.  Typically, more volatile markets encourage traders to buy and sell more often, handing more revenue to market makers that charge a spread on each transaction.  Volumes are now rebounding across asset classes.  Turnover of currency futures topped $200 billion on Monday, more than double the daily average reported year-to-date, data provided to Reuters by CME showed. That included more than $70 billion of trading in euro\/dollar and $49 billion in dollar\/yen.  EBS, which runs one of the world\u2019s biggest FX platforms, declined to give data for Monday but told Reuters that volumes for last week had run 80% above 2019 averages.  Volumes in G10 currencies were nearly double their 2019 daily average, EBS said.  Refinitiv, another big forex market player, said Monday had been its busiest day for spot currency trading since the U.S. Presidential Election in November 2016.  The company declined to give the dollar value for Monday\u2019s volumes but said activity on its FX Matching platform was more than double the daily average traded during February.  Markets are now the most volatile since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.  Wall Street's so-called fear gauge .VIX has reached its most elevated since 2008, U.S. Treasury market volatility .MOVE the highest since 2009, and price swings in the FX market are at three-year highs.  (Graphic: Market volatility soars - )  BOND TRADING  Bond trading platforms are also reporting increased activity as clients dump riskier bonds and pile into the safety of government debt such as U.S. Treasuries, where yields have collapsed to record lows.  However, the rise in volumes last week was not dramatic and Monday actually saw reduced activity, suggesting many investors had stuck to the sidelines.  MarketAxess, which runs a major fixed-income platform and tracks trading flows, said market-wide trading of government and corporate bonds by European investors totaled 136.8 billion euros ($155.5 billion) on Monday. That compared with a daily average of 190 billion euros last week.  Daily volumes in 2020 have ranged from as low as 78 billion euros to as high as 228 billion euros, MarketAxess data showed.  Tradeweb, another company running a large bond trading platform, declined to give specific numbers.  \u201cWhile we don\u2019t report our trading activity on a daily basis, we continue to experience strong volumes across our platforms in line with broader market volatility,\u201d Tradeweb said.  There is some evidence that the jump in volatility may also be undermining liquidity - the ease with which buyers and sellers can transact without moving the price.  Prior to Monday, traders say frenzied trading activity had generally been orderly.  \u201cIn the morning, we tried to trim a position in the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond and were shocked when several dealers were reluctant to show us a firm price, something we can\u2019t remember ever happening before,\u201d TwentyFour Asset Management said in a daily note, referring to Monday.  \u201cNormal service resumed shortly afterward, but to us this was a stark illustration of the sheer panic that permeated the market.\u201d  (This story has been refiled to amend paragraph 20 to make clear MarketAxess data is market-wide)","312":"Oct 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasuries market\u2019s two-day selloff pushed its volatility to its highest level since June as investors shed their bond holdings on surprisingly strong economic data and signals the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates further.  The increase in market volatility may portend another leg-up in yields which reached multi-year peaks on Thursday, as it raised the premiums on fixed income options and derivatives, making hedging more expensive for bond managers and traders, analysts said.  The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield touched 3.232 percent, which was the highest level since May 2011.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s MOVE indexes, which track traders\u2019 expectations of swings in the $15 trillion Treasuries market, recorded their biggest two-day increases since late May.

The two usually remain within a few dollars of one another, and the gap skewed trading in the London market, causing activity to fall.  Traders feared shutdowns of air travel and precious metal refineries due to the coronavirus outbreak will make it harder to ship bullion from London to the United States to meet contractual requirements.  London is a key gold storage center, where thousands of tonnes of metal underpin trading, but it uses 400-ounce bars which must be melted down and recast as 100-ounce bars to be accepted by Comex in New York.  The LBMA and executives at major gold-trading banks asked CME to allow 400-ounce bars to be used to settle Comex contracts, said the two sources, both of whom were involved in the discussions.  No one was immediately available for comment at CME after Reuters contacted the company via phone and email.  The rule change would obviate the need to reshape and transport metal, meaning it could remain in vaults in London while ownership is transferred.

The data put further downward pressure on the dollar, lifting the appeal of gold which is seen as a safe haven. Spot gold was up 0.3% at $1,618.60 per ounce by 1235 GMT. \"Short term, initially gold may rise when stocks fall because it's a safe haven asset. However if selling in stocks continue, funds may see margin calls and need to sell gold for cash,\" said Samson Li, a Hong Kong-based precious metals analyst at Refinitiv GFMS. \"Long term, with all the liquidity central banks are injecting into the system, there will be massive purchasing power destruction in the future, which will be good for gold.\" Data showed the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits shot to an all-time high of more than 3 million last week as strict measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic hit economic activity. The U.S. Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly backed a $2 trillion bill aimed at helping unemployed workers and industries hurt by the coronavirus, but that did little to prop up risk sentiment. This came after the U.S. Federal Reserve said on Monday it would buy bonds in unlimited numbers and backstop direct loans to companies. \"We see real interest rates remaining negative for a long time, keeping the non-yielding gold investments attractive... Any price setback will be an opportunity to buy gold,\" said Soni Kumari, commodity strategist at ANZ. Gold market participants, meanwhile, remained concerned about a supply squeeze in the market, following a sharp divergence in London and New York prices as the coronavirus closed precious metals refineries. U.S. exchange operator CME Group on Tuesday announced a new gold futures contract to combat price volatility caused by the shutdown of gold supply routes, but traders and bankers said it would not immediately calm markets. U.S. gold futures rose 1% to $1,649.40 per ounce, and held above the London spot contract. Elsewhere, palladium dropped 2.3% to $2,264.53 per ounce, having registered its largest daily gain since 1997 on Wednesday as a lockdown in major producer South Africa exacerbated supply woes. \"Palladium is still not on very firm ground as the metal is more sensitive to economic meltdown,\" ANZ's Kumari said. Platinum slipped 2.1% to $722.31 an ounce, while silver shed 0.3% to $14.39.

Trade sources had earlier told Reuters of the planned change.  The new formula will be based on the average monthly prices of Oman crude futures traded on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) and the average cash price for Dubai assessed by pricing agency S&P Global Platts, instead of the average of Oman and Dubai prices assessed by Platts, Aramco said.  Saudi Aramco\u2019s OSPs for October will be based on the average settlement prices for the DME December Oman contract and the December Dubai cash price assessed by Platts, both of which are set in October.  S&P Global Platts said in a statement that it respected each market participant\u2019s right to decide its preferred way of pricing term contracts, but that the market decides which price references are ultimately adopted as benchmarks.  \u201cWe are closely engaged with a wide variety of market participants in this ongoing discussion, including in Saudi Arabia, and we believe Platts\u2019 benchmarks remain robust and relevant to all market participants,\u201d it said.  DME did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by Reuters.  While Saudi Aramco\u2019s decision surprised the market, a proposal to switch benchmarks has been discussed internally for years, the sources said.  The DME launched the Oman contract in 2007 and it is the most liquid physically deliverable futures contract for Middle East crude oil. In comparison, there are rarely bids or offers for Oman cargoes during the Platts market-on-close price assessment.  \u201cIt is obvious - look at the trading volumes of DME versus Platts for Oman,\u201d said Adi Imsirovic, a teaching fellow at the University of Surrey\u2019s Energy Economics Centre who wrote a paper on Middle East oil benchmarks published in 2014.  Last year, Iraq\u2019s Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) proposed pricing its Basra crude sales to Asia on DME Oman futures starting with January-loading cargoes, but the plan was shelved.  \u201cSOMO was the first on the case but they did not think it through nominations. SOMO went back to the drawing board. Aramco could not be left behind!\u201d Imsirovic said.  here  BOOST DME TRADE  Saudi Aramco\u2019s decision could improve the liquidity for Oman futures trading on the DME and also for derivative instruments based off the Oman contract for hedging or price conversion purposes, a Singapore-based trader said.  \u201cThis is a good change as Platts Oman cannot be hedged,\u201d he said.  Saudi Aramco usually sets its monthly OSPs around the fifth of each month, and those set the trend for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi prices, affecting more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude bound for Asia.  It was not immediately clear if the other Middle East producers will also change their benchmarks.","317":"BEIJING, March 22 (Reuters) - The launch of China\u2019s yuan-denominated oil futures will mark the culmination of a decade-long push by the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) aimed at giving the world\u2019s largest energy consumer more power in pricing crude sold to Asia.  WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS AMONG FOREIGN INVESTORS?  * Worries include how to freely exchange the yuan because of a Chinese clampdown on capital outflows, while some concerns remain about Beijing\u2019s heavy handed intervention in its commodity markets in recent years, traders and analysts said.  The obligation to trade Shanghai crudes in yuan will also add a currency risk to the market, which some traders are reluctant to take.  * The Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), the unit of ShFE running the contract, has strict daily limits on the number of cancelled orders allowed per account, aimed at curbing spoofing. This involves placing bids to buy or offers to sell futures contracts with the intent to cancel them before execution. By creating an illusion of demand, spoofers can influence prices to benefit their market positions.  For a larger client placing orders of more than 300 lots, equivalent to 30,000 barrels of oil, the limit is 50 a day. Users with smaller orders are allowed 500 cancellations.  That\u2019s different to international exchanges, like the CME , which uses a ratio based on an investor\u2019s traded volume.  On days when price volatility and volumes are high, overseas investors new to Chinese markets could get penalised if they exceed those restrictions as they try to adjust their positions, traders say.  * Chinese commodity futures investors do not typically trade steadily over the months, but instead pick specific months in which they deal. That could complicate efforts to trade spreads between Brent, WTI and Shanghai.  Take iron ore, one of China\u2019s most-active futures markets: most of the more than 2.3 million lots of open interest are in May and September contracts, with delivery months in between ranging from tens of thousands of lots to in some cases less than 10.  In contrast, liquidity across the first five months of the Brent and WTI contracts are relatively evenly spread out, reflecting their popularity among hedge funds and other financial players, who like to trade month by month.  * There will be a 1.5-hour gap between the settlement and the price settlement by S&P Global Platts, which sets physical prices for the region between 4:00-4:30 p.m.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING CHINA\u2019S NATIONAL HOLIDAYS?  Trading will stop for China\u2019s week-long national holidays - Spring Festival and Golden Week - leaving the Shanghai market out of synch with the western exchanges.  Shorter trading hours - with three slots each day - compared with almost 24 hours on western exchanges means the market may sometimes play catch-up with the rest of the world.  WHO WILL USE IT IN THE DOMESTIC INDUSTRY?  China has opened more than 6,000 trading accounts, including the country\u2019s oil majors and about 150 brokerages. Ten foreign intermediaries have registered, including JPMorgan, Bands Financial, Straits Financial Services and other Hong Kong based affliates of domestic brokerages.  It will likely attract mainly \u2018mon-and-pop\u2019 speculative investors, who dominate the country\u2019s other often volatile commodity futures markets from dates to iron ore, although transaction fees for crude are relatively high.  China\u2019s independent refineries are more likely to process heavy crude instead of the medium-sour crude traded in futures, a Shandong-based crude trader said.  At least three independent refineries who are looking to use the contract for hedging also said they are unsure about delivery. Under the rules, buyers cannot choose a specific grade that will be delivered or the location of the warehouse for delivery.  HOW DO FOREIGN USERS OPEN A TRADING ACCOUNT?  Foreign investors will need to open a non-residential bank account with one of the eight banks that handles margin deposit for yuan crude futures, according to INE.  The banks are Agricultural Bank of China, CITIC Bank, China Construction Bank and Industrial and Commerical Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Merchant Bank and the Development Bank of Singapore.  Investors will need to transfer money from that bank account to an account opened with either a domestic broker or foreign broker or agencies registered with the INE. The broker will open two accounts with INE: one for margin deposit and one for settlement for foreign currencies.","318":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has upended U.S. equities trading with unprecedented market volatility and forced bourses like the New York Stock Exchange to close their trading floors, raising questions about the need for such spaces.  FILE PHOTO: The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seen in the financial district of lower Manhattan during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in New York City, U.S., April 26, 2020. REUTERS\/Jeenah Moon  The NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N, closed its stock and options trading floors in New York and San Francisco in March 23 after traders and an ICE employee tested positive for the virus. Rivals CME Group CME.O, Cboe Global Markets Inc CBOE.Z and Nasdaq Inc NDAQ.O also closed their options and futures pits in Chicago and Philadelphia.  Despite the move to all-electronic trading, none of the exchange operators experienced any major technical glitches amid record volumes, and all of them reported first-quarter profits that beat analysts\u2019 expectations.  Cboe aims to reopen its options trading floor on June 1 after acknowledging that some customers were frustrated by the exchange\u2019s electronic trading tools and were unable to get the most risky and complex types of orders completed, it said on Friday.  At the same time, Chief Executive Ed Tilly said Cboe will soon roll out new electronic solutions that will replicate benefits of the floor for those more complex orders, prompting analysts to question the need to reopen the spaces at all.  \u201cOur position has always been that when our customers tell us that there\u2019s no utility in the trading crowd, when brokers provide no service to their customers, the electronic solution will close the trading floor, not Cboe and not its management team,\u201d Tilly said.  The NYSE is the only U.S. exchange that still operates stock trading floors alongside electronic trading. It released a study on Thursday showing that floor traders dampen volatility by providing tighter bid-offer spreads, especially at the market close, saving investors millions of dollars a day.  While the floor distinguishes NYSE from its competitors, the closure has not led to a significant drop in market share, according to an analysis released Friday by industry trade group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.  \u201cOnly time will tell if investors feel the difference in execution of their trades with or without the human interaction on the floor,\u201d the study said.  The NYSE plans to reopen its San Francisco-based options floor on Monday. It has not given a date for the reopening of its iconic floors at 11 Wall Street.  CME, which runs the world\u2019s largest futures exchange, said on Wednesday it was unclear when it would reopen its trading floors, where about 10% of its business was done.  \u201cWe will not do anything irrational either way until we know exactly where health officials and government officials are going to come down as far as multiple people getting together in a single location,\u201d CEO Terry Duffy told analysts on a call.  The closure had little effect on trading activity, CME said.  \u201cParticipants can trade any strategy today as easily as they could prior to the closure of the floor,\u201d said Sean Tully, a senior managing director at the exchange.","319":"(Adds NEX Group statement, CME response)  March 15 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s NEX Group Plc has received a preliminary takeover approach from U.S. exchange operator CME Group Inc, the Michael Spencer-led financial technology company said on Thursday.

Yet it is Amsterdam that is proving the most visible early winner.  Data last week showed the Dutch capital had displaced London as Europe\u2019s biggest share trading centre in January, grabbing a fifth of the 40 billion euros-a-day action, up from below a tenth of trading pre-Brexit.  Yet that is just one of several areas the city has quietly stolen a march on its rivals as it attracts businesses from Britain, evoking memories of its history as a global trading powerhouse in the 17th century.  Amsterdam has also overtaken London to become Europe\u2019s number one corporate listing venue so far this year, data shows, and the leader in euro-denominated interest-rate swaps, a market estimated to be worth about $135 trillion in 2020.  \u201cThere is a whole culture of trading, and to be close to that was very positive,\u201d said Robert Barnes, CEO of London Stock Exchange-owned share trading platform Turquoise, which has selected the Dutch capital over Paris for its post-Brexit hub.  \u201cYou have some of the big institutional banks, you have specialist trading firms, a dynamic retail community. But it\u2019s also in the heart of continental Europe.\u201d  Cboe Europe, an equities exchange, told Reuters it was launching an equities derivatives venture in Amsterdam in the coming weeks to emulate the trading model built in its Chicago home.  Asked why Cboe chose Amsterdam over rivals, Howson said the Netherlands was where he saw \u201csubstantive growth\u201d for his industry in Europe. He also cited the wide use of English in the city and Dutch regulation being friendly to global investors, in contrast to some European countries\u2019 preference for championing domestically-focused firms.  \u201cYou need core Europe to be competitive on a global scale,\u201d said Howson. \u201cA more insular Europe or too much national interest makes that a difficult thing.\u201d  Yet while the arrival of such businesses may bring higher tax revenues from trading volumes and private investment in infrastructure, the city is not experiencing a jobs boom, as many companies relocating there tend to be highly specialised, and smaller employers.  Turquoise\u2019s new Amsterdam operation, for instance, sits in the former head office of the Dutch East India Company, the trading megacorporation that fuelled Amsterdam\u2019s rise to its former finance fame - yet it only employs four staff.  The Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, which has led the effort to woo Brexit business, told Reuters it estimated about 1,000 new jobs had been created by financial firms moving operations to Amsterdam since Britain left the EU.  That\u2019s a fraction of the 7,500 to 10,000 jobs estimated to have left London for the EU since 2016, when Britain voted the leave the bloc, and a drop in the ocean compared with the British capital\u2019s financial workforce, which numbers over half a million.

REUTERS\/Piroschka van de Wouw\/File Photo  Many investment banks with their large staffs have looked elsewhere on the continent, deterred in part by Dutch laws that limit banker bonuses.  HOW IT\u2019S GETTING AHEAD  Amsterdam leads the European listings table this year, having attracted $3.4 billion-worth of initial public offerings (IPOs), Refinitiv data shows. That included Poland\u2019s InPost, which raised 2.8 billion euros in the biggest European IPO in 2021 so far.  Spanish fintech form Allfunds, Dutch web startup WeTransfer and two \u201cblank-cheque\u201d firms - one backed by ex-Commerzbank chief executive Martin Blessing and another by French tycoon Bernard Arnault - are planning to list on Euronext Amsterdam.  At least three technology companies from Central and East European are also considering listings as Brexit dents London\u2019s allure, bankers told Reuters.  Banking sources working on the two blank-cheque, or special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), said Dutch regulations were closest to rules in the United States, making it easier to appeal globally.  In the euro-denominated interest rate swaps market, platforms in Amsterdam and New York have grabbed the bulk of business lost by London, whose share fell from just under 40% in July to just over 10% in January, IHS Markit data shows.  That made the Dutch capital the biggest player, an advance from last July when platforms in the city commanded just 10% of the market.  Amsterdam will also become home to the European carbon emissions trading, worth a billion euros a day in trading volumes, when the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) moves the market from London later this year.  Graphic: Trading centres  BIG BANKS AND BONUSES  The Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, which began analysing where Amsterdam could capitalise after Britain\u2019s 2016 decision to leave the EU, said it had identified certain financial sectors where it believed it could have an edge.  \u201cWe focused on specialist areas ... that were trading and fintech,\u201d said spokesman Michiel Bakhuizen, adding that the city played up the strength of its low-latency digital trading infrastructure.  \u201cThe big investment banks were always going to move to Frankfurt and Paris because of the Dutch legislation that is in place for bank bonuses,\u201d he added, referring to a 2015 law limiting variable pay to a maximum of 20% of base salary.  This drive to focus on specialist areas rather than appeal more broadly could be reflected in the number of companies relocating.  In response to Brexit, 47 firms have shifted operations entirely or partly to Amsterdam from London, according to preliminary data compiled by New Financial, a think-tank.  That is lower than the 88 firms that have moved business to Paris and the 56 to Frankfurt.  Companies to have shifted operations to the Netherlands include CME, MarketAxess and Tradeweb. A handful of asset managers and banks including Commonwealth Bank of Australia are also relocating there.  By contrast, those firms that have moved departments and staff to Frankfurt have mainly been big investment banks, including JP Morgan, Citi and Morgan Stanley, while Paris has mostly welcomed banks and asset managers, according to New Financial.  \u2018WAY TOO EARLY TO CALL\u2019  William Wright, New Financial\u2019s managing director, notes that although fewer firms have made the move to Amsterdam, the city\u2019s share \u201cis highly concentrated by sector, with Amsterdam having a clear lead in areas like broking, trading, exchanges and fintech\u201d.  Amsterdam\u2019s apparent success, however, may be flattered because Brexit has so far hit trading hardest, and such business may be easier to move.  \u201cThe early data on the impact of Brexit is mainly trading-based, hence Amsterdam looks like it is doing particularly well,\u201d Wright added. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not making a call on Amsterdam for IPOs yet as I think it\u2019s way too early.\u201d  Sander van Leijenhorst, Brexit programme manager at the AFM Dutch financial regulator, said authorities would actually have preferred London retaining its dominance because of the efficiencies that come from concentrating everything in a single European hub, he said.  But once the implications of Brexit became clearer, it was obvious that Amsterdam - home to the world\u2019s oldest stock exchange - would appeal, he added.  \u201cThere was already a group of traders here. They tend to come together, they tend to flock together.\u201d","322":"GENEVA (Reuters) - Rising U.S. crude oil exports to Europe and Asia have had a knock-on effect in the futures market, turning the U.S. West Texas Intermediate contract into a near-24 hour benchmark, exchange operator CME Group said.  FILE PHOTO: A pump jack is seen at sunrise near Bakersfield, California October 14, 2014. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  Owain Johnson, managing director for energy research and development at CME, said the shift has also led CME to introduce the first change to the quality of WTI crude since 1983, coming into force from January next year.  \u201cTen to 20 percent of our daily volumes are trading in European and Asian hours... names that we never came across are now regulars. South Korea and China are the fastest-growing trading community on WTI,\u201d Johnson said at the Argus Global Crude conference in Geneva, Switzerland.  \u201cYou\u2019re getting a 23-hour benchmark... The more liquidity on futures, the more liquidity on the options. Options are really starting to trade in depth and in Euro and Asian hours.\u201d  The CME shuts down for one hour every day for maintenance.  Johnson said he sees a trend in which the biggest benchmarks are going global while smaller ones are withering away.  U.S. shale and heavy Canadian crudes have had a major impact on the quality of crude for export. After refiners complained about blended grades dubbed \u201cFranken-crudes\u201d, the CME announced last year that five new tests would be conducted to ensure quality consistency. The tests are being introduced gradually and the industry must comply with them fully by January next year.  \u201cWe wanted to ensure that the barrel at Cushing is a clean barrel that does not have too much blended high-metals Canadian material in it,\u201d he said, referring to the traditional hub for WTI in Cushing, Oklahoma.  The changes have already largely been adopted and priced in ahead of the official shift in January, he said.  The CME has been launching new U.S. oil contracts for new crude grades as spreads to WTI that have been picked up quickly by the market, Johnson said.  \u201cThey are some of the fastest-growing launches. New derivatives are very liquid for new U.S. grades. It\u2019s trading very aggressively, mainly through brokers... and they\u2019re popular with Asian and European importers,\u201d he said.  Furthermore, as the significance of landlocked Cushing wanes as a hub, the global exchanges are racing to introduce new contracts out of Houston.  On Nov. 5, the CME will launch a deliverable contract called WTI Houston based off three terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Rival Intercontinental Exchange announced a similar delivered contract in July.","323":"(Adds more detail, context)  LONDON, March 26 (Reuters) - Stock exchanges defended their coronavirus contingency plans on Thursday, saying they are working well under extreme market conditions, after banks questioned their level of preparedness.  \u201cThese plans ensure that everything is working satisfactorily, including in the context of \u2018working from home\u2019 protocols, and have been executed on close cooperation with supervisory authorities,\u201d the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) said in a statement.  Stock markets have experienced extreme volatility as investors dump shares in the face of a likely recession, sparking talk that suspensions in trading could be needed.

The Association for Financial Markets in Europe, which is helping to organise the questionnaire, said the information gathered will help its members better understand their plans and preparations.  FESE said that exchanges are supervised continually to ensure they remain robust and reliable across a broad spectrum of scenarios, including a pandemic.  Banks have moved trading to back up sites or homes, raising concerns about connectivity speeds and their ability to provide timely liquidity to form share prices efficiently.  The London Stock Exchange on Thursday announced a waiver in fees in a bid to attract more market makers to bolster liquidity.  FESE said regulators like the European Union\u2019s securities watchdog ESMA and national regulators have assessed the preparedness of all market participants to ensure they have robust contingency plans and IT systems, FESE said.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)  * Shanghai metals Q1 volumes: reut.rs\/39RjwGK  * Shanghai open interest: reut.rs\/39MtZmV  * LME Q1 volumes by contract: reut.rs\/2URU4wH  LONDON, April 8 (Reuters) - The spread of the deadly coronavirus has upended industrial metal markets, with many plunging to multi-year lows and volatility spiking across the board.  Uncertainty rules as traders try to navigate both the unprecedented demand shock of a world in lockdown and the trailing supply shocks that are accumulating from ever more mine closures.  Market turmoil has translated into surging trading volumes on all three major metals hubs in London, Shanghai and New York.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) in particular has registered a series of spectacular year-on-year increases in activity, which has been replicated across other commodity trading arenas in China.  This does not appear to be down to the day-trading crowd that has surged through the commodities space in the past, but rather a step-change in industrial user activity.  It\u2019s a similar story on both the London Metal Exchange and the CME, with evidence that speculators have cut their exposure to industrial metals even as supply-chain disruption has boosted industrial participation.  SHANGHAI SURPRISE  Shanghai trading volumes exploded in March after reduced activity in January-February, when much of the country was in lockdown.  A breakdown of activity by contract is full of surprises.  Volumes in zinc and steel rebar, both past favourites of day-traders because of their relatively low pricing and resulting low margin requirements, dropped sharply in the first quarter to the tune of 52% and 56% respectively.  These year-on-year comparisons are adjusted to factor in ShFE\u2019s change of methodology at the start of 2020. The exchange moved from double-counting buy and sell sides to single-counting transactions to conform both with international standards and financial exchanges in China.  It was tin that shone in the first quarter with volumes mushrooming to 2.25 million contracts from 571,000 in the year-earlier period.  The exchange\u2019s new stainless steel contract, launched in September last year, also attracted huge trading interest in March, with volumes of 1.19 million eclipsing last year\u2019s aggregate four-month tally.  Equally significant has been the general lift in market open interest over the first quarter, another sign that day-traders have not been the driver of the trading action.  Only two Shanghai metals contracts had lower open interest at the end of March than a year earlier - zinc and nickel.  Everything else registered strong builds, once again led by tin, which saw resting positions more than triple to 77,683 contracts from 21,757 at the end of March 2019.  LONDON BOUNCE  The London Metal Exchange (LME) prides itself on being the world\u2019s foremost forum for the world\u2019s industrial metal hedgers, so it\u2019s no surprise that volumes also exploded in March.  This marks a significant change of trend. LME volumes, including UNA (unallocated) trades, slid by 4.6% last year and were down another 2.9% in the first two months of 2020.  However, average daily activity jumped by 15% in March to 794,139 contracts. That was the highest monthly total since April 2018, an outlier month when U.S. sanctions on aluminium producer Rusal saw volumes on the exchange\u2019s most liquid contract explode.  The strong March performance lifted the LME\u2019s first-quarter volumes by 4.6% relative to last year, or by 3.1% on an average daily basis.  Increased activity was registered on all the LME\u2019s major contracts with only three smaller ones bucking the trend - tin, which was very marginally lower, North American aluminium alloy (NASAAC) and steel scrap.  Notwithstanding less action in the scrap contract, the LME\u2019s foray into the world of ferrous trading appears to be bearing fruit.  Steel rebar volumes were up by 68% year-on-year while both new hot-rolled-coil contracts, cash settled against Argus (China) and S&P Global Platts (North American), registered turnover of 30,326 contracts and 2,166 contracts respectively.  Looking less healthy are the exchange\u2019s gold and silver contracts, with cumulative volumes slumping by 94% despite the current heightened interest in gold as a safe-haven play.  The LME\u2019s attempt to break into the precious space has been struggling for several months despite a number of incentive schemes.  Also worth a mention is the LME\u2019s owner Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx), which has seen volumes accelerate on its new dollar-denominated \u201cmini\u201d base metal contracts.  The LME has tried \u201cmini\u201d contracts twice without success and HKEx\u2019s own yuan-denominated contracts have withered on the vine.  But with the dollar products, HKEx appears to be onto something. Volumes totalled 36,697 in January-March, compared with 29,334 in the first five months of trading in August-December last year.  CME ALUMINIUM CONTRACTS SHINE  Underlining the broader trend of increased industrial user activity is the sharp rise in activity in the CME\u2019s aluminium premium contracts.  All four saw trading surge in the first three months of this year, with volume increases ranging from 73% (North American) to 230% (European duty unpaid).  The exchange\u2019s aluminium futures contract has also bounced back from the dead after going international, with Asian physical delivery points added to the existing U.S. warehouse network.  After not trading at all over the course of 2018 and the first part of 2019, volumes picked up to total 9,246 contracts in the first quarter of 2020.  It\u2019s noticeable that the CME is seeing more active movement of physical aluminium stocks, particularly at Malaysia\u2019s Port Klang, which currently holds 8,998 tonnes out of total registered inventory of 23,778 tonnes.  The CME\u2019s most active industrial metals contract remains copper, which saw volumes rise by 16% in the first quarter after a 27% decline in 2019.  However, market open interest dropped sharply over the course of March, ending the month at 182,253 contracts, down 27% on March 2019.  That seems to reflect a collective exit of fund money from the copper market with money managers holding minimal long positions and covering short positions over the last two weeks.  It may be a sign of the broader fund dash for cash or of simple fatigue with volatile markets that continue to chop around on each and every update on the spread of COVID-19.  But it does underline how speculators, whether Chinese or American, have not been as active as industrial hedgers in the last couple of months.  That may well change but in the interim there is likely to be no let-up in physical supply-chain disruption over the coming months, which suggests that the big three metals exchanges are going to continue to thrive in our currently chaotic world.","325":"SHANGHAI\/BEIJING (Reuters) - Bank of China Ltd (BoC) said its main investors will settle trades for its crude oil futures trading product at -$37.63 per barrel, after confirming that the negative settlement price was not a systemic error.

BoC had said in an earlier statement that it had suspended transactions to open new positions for the crude oil \u201cbao\u201d from Wednesday in light of \u201ccurrent market and delivery risks\u201d.  On Tuesday the bank had suspended trading in both of its U.S. crude oil contract products for a day.  CME, which this month updated its systems to be able to process negative prices, said on Tuesday that its markets were working properly after crude futures sank into negative territory. It also told clearing firms and clients that it had a plan in place \u201cif major energy prices continue to fall toward zero in the coming months.\u201d  Global oil benchmark Brent has fallen 72% this year because of the global economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and after major producer Saudi Arabia started a price war.  This led Chinese banks and funds to adjust or limit trading in oil related products and investments. Chinese mutual fund houses had restricted or suspended subscriptions in outbound oil and gas related funds following the fall.  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) in March adjusted the bid-ask spread for trading on global crude oil after prices fell to a 17-year low.","326":"* New LME technology speeds contracts launch  * LME competing with CME and Shanghai Exchange  * 10 new contracts to be launched in Q1 2019  * FACTBOX on new contracts:  LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - New steel and alumina contracts have the best chance of succeeding as the London Metal Exchange unleashes 10 new products early next year in an attempt to compete more effectively with rival exchanges, industry sources said.  The new products range from hot rolled coil (HRC) steel to alumina, the raw material for aluminium, as well as cobalt, which is key for electric vehicle (EV) batteries.  The 141-year-old LME also plans to launch a contract for lithium, another important metal for EVs, but that will come later, perhaps in 2020.  The LME, the world\u2019s oldest and largest market for industrial metals like copper and aluminium, has lost market share in recent years to competitors the U.S. CME Group Inc and Chinese Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE).  The CME has released a consistent stream of new contracts, while the LME has taken more time to come up with a smaller group of new products.  But the LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. , has developed new technology that makes launching these new contracts easier, faster and less expensive.  \u201cThe core will still be the main LME base metals contracts, but they\u2019re not afraid to give some new ones a try,\u201d said Colin Hamilton, director of commodities research at BMO Capital.  \u201cIf they get one to work it will probably be steel while alumina is also an interesting one given the volatility.\u201d  The CME already has HRC steel and alumina contracts, which have struggled to gain strong liquidity, and the LME will face the same challenge.  \u201cThe LME is facing a lot of competitive pressure from the CME in particular, but also ShFE. The LME has to respond in kind,\u201d said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale.  REGIONAL HRC CONTRACTS  The existing HRC steel contract on the CME\u2019s Nymex exchange is for U.S. metal only, based on consultancy CRU\u2019s U.S. Midwest index.  The LME hopes to go one step further by having three regional contracts covering Europe, North America and China.  \u201cWe are seeing strong appetite for our HRC contracts and expect these to help extend the record volumes we\u2019re currently seeing in our ferrous offering,\u201d the LME told Reuters in an emailed statement.  HRC steel is used in vehicles, agriculture machinery and rail equipment.  The LME already has steel rebar and scrap contracts and the latter hit record volumes in August with average daily volumes up 88 percent so far this year.  The LME rebar contract has not been as popular, however, with average volumes down 68 percent for the first eight months.  VOLATILE ALUMINA  The LME also plans to launch a contract for alumina, the raw material to make aluminium, which has seen sharp price swings recently.  The alumina price has twice spiked and tumbled so far this year. It surged 80 percent during March and April before sliding the following two months before jumping 41 percent by early September.  Bhar said people at a recent aluminium conference seemed interested in the prospect of hedging exposure to aluminium raw materials.  \u201cDelegates seemed to like the possibility of risk management through an alumina contract, but it may be difficult to get liquidity,\u201d he said.  The CME contract is indexed against Platts\u2019 assessment of the Australian price, while the LME plans to announce in coming weeks which index providers it will use for its alumina, HRC steel and other cash-settled contracts.  COBALT  The LME already has a physically-settled cobalt contract , but it hopes to gain more traction with a cash-settled product.  Gaining a foothold in such a small, illiquid market is difficult, even with the excitement recently about EVs, said Tom Price, head of commodity strategy at Macquarie.  \u201cMost transactions are directly between industry and consumers, the LME is a sideshow,\u201d he said.  Other futures contracts the LME plans to launch early next year consist of two regional aluminium premium contracts, minor metal molybdenum plus options in gold and silver.","327":"May 30 (Reuters) - Single-day trading volume on U.S. Treasury and interest rates futures and options reached a record high on Tuesday as jitters about Italy\u2019s political instability and a rout in U.S. and European stocks spurred a massive bond market rally, a CME Group spokeswoman said on Wednesday.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  That trend runs contrary to grain industry expectations for block trades, which the CME Group Inc, parent of the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, began allowing in markets such as corn and wheat in January.  The CME has said it expanded block trading in agricultural products to boost trade in thinly traded markets, including contracts for deferred delivery.  Yet the CFTC found the bulk of block trades were executed in front contract months, which are typically the most actively traded agricultural futures and options.  \u201cThe use of block trades in liquid contracts appears to conflict with the expectations set by the CME,\u201d the CFTC\u2019s report said.  \u201cThe industry concern is that block trades are pulling volume from liquid contracts,\u201d the report said.  However, the CFTC found no rule violation in nearby block trades, and said after reviewing CME grain and livestock trading data from Jan. 8 to March 31 that block trades complied with CME rules requiring trades to be executed at a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d price.  The CFTC said it would continue to monitor block trades for examples of lost liquidity in nearby contracts, and for block prices falling outside the normal trade range.  \u201cWe are continuing to review the CFTC\u2019s report,\u201d a CME Group spokesman said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe believe ag block trades are beneficial to our markets and the participants who rely on them to manage their risk.\u201d  CME executives discussed block trades in a meeting with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue last week during which they said they were holding periodic talks on the topic with the National Grain and Feed Association, a trade group that represents commercial grain handlers.  Block trades are struck away from the exchange, sometimes outside of regular trading hours, but still cleared by the exchange. Proponents say the transactions help them execute large orders without disrupting prices in thinly traded markets.  Some brokers oppose block trades, saying they unfairly allow big players to trade in secret, bypassing the open market.  \u201cThis is the exchange catering to the big managed money accounts, and the traditional players are not relevant to them,\u201d said Scott Hedin, an independent grain trader.  Block trades represent an extremely small portion of CME\u2019s overall trading volume in agricultural products, the CFTC said, although its analysis showed volume can be \u201csomewhat more significant on specific dates and for certain contract months.\u201d","331":"OSLO (Reuters) - The operator of the London stock exchange (LSE) is reportedly interested in bidding for Norway's Oslo Bors OSLO.NFF which, if correct, could trigger a bidding war for the Norwegian exchange, already the subject of a bid by Euronext ENX.PA.  The LSE LSE.L has enlisted an unidentified bank to consider how a deal for Oslo Bors could be put together, an anonymous source close to the company was quoted as saying by the London-based Evening Standard newspaper on Monday.

It said on Jan. 11 it had received interest from other parties  One of these parties could be Nasdaq NDAQ.O, which owns stock exchanges in several Nordic countries such as Sweden, Denmark and Finland, according to the Financial Times.  If LSE were to bid, it would be its first attempt at a deal with a stock market operator since European regulators blocked its proposed merger with Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE in 2017.  At the time, that was the fifth attempt at an Anglo-German tie up. It unravelled in the wake of Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Since then, the LSE has been seen in the market as a takeover target rather than a predator with rivals Intercontinental Exchange ICE.N and CME CME.O in the United States long seen as suitors, analysts have said.

The LME\u2019s cash-settled contract will be settled against an industry benchmark.  \u201cDuring the first six months, merchants and traders will put volumes in to get liquidity going,\u201d a broking source said. \u201cIf that works, manufacturing companies including BMW and Volvo will ask suppliers to make offers on the basis of LME prices for new, small contracts, see how it works.\u201d  One source said BMW already uses iron ore derivatives as a proxy for hedging some of its steel costs, so could move with relative ease to trading the new LME contracts.  BMW said it is currently pursuing a \u201chedging strategy\u201d and aims to \u201cincrease planning reliability for the company\u201d.  Volvo said: \u201cWe continuously review our raw material strategies however no decisions have been taken on hedging.\u201d  Automakers, alongside construction firms, banks, brokers, merchants and steel service centers, have traditionally been open to steel futures, while steelmakers have mostly been opposed, concerned about potential loss of pricing power.  Industry sources say automaker interest bodes well for the contracts, but they also stressed that new contracts usually take years to gain traction, adding that a lack of interest from steelmakers could slow the process.  \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, first merchants get involved, then prop traders, then service centers or stockists. Eventually mills start offering steel on an index (linked price),\u201d said a source at an LME brokerage.  Sources involved in broking and looking at providing liquidity for the new contracts say they are talking to leading steelmakers about using the new contracts.  The LME already has contracts for steel scrap SSCc3 and for steel rebar SRRc2, a type of construction steel. Volumes have been growing modestly since the contracts' 2015 launch.  Some 4.2 million tonnes of scrap and 500,000 tonnes of rebar have been traded on the LME in the year to date, versus 3 million tonnes of scrap and 644,000 tonnes of rebar traded last year, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

Gold is increasingly in demand from buyers who believe it is likely to hold its value relative to other assets as the virus shakes the global economy. [GOL\/]  Prices are up 14% this year and near eight-year highs around $1,725 an ounce.  Futures and ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to gold prices. Gold futures contracts give buyers the right to receive metal at a future date. ETFs store gold on investors\u2019 behalf.  Futures tend to attract shorter-term investors and ETFs longer term investors. Futures positions are more expensive to hold, but are easy to trade in and out of and do not require investors to pay the full cost of the gold up front.  Investment flows into the two products typically move in parallel.  But since late March, total ETF holdings have grown 14%, while long positions -- bets on higher prices -- on the Comex exchange in New York fell 7%, according to data from the World Gold Council and CME Group, which operates Comex.  SPDR Gold Shares, the largest and most actively traded ETF, has swelled its gold hoard by 24% since late March.  (GRAPHIC - Gold ETF holdings vs futures positioning: )  The shift coincides with a period of reduced trading on Comex after coronavirus lockdowns interrupted gold supply routes and big gold-trading banks pulled back from the exchange.

(Compiled by Nikhil Subba and Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru)","342":"LONDON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Britain should avoid regulations which allow arbitrage opportunities in the trading of euro denominated swaps after Brexit, France\u2019s top market regulator warned on Thursday.  The European Union is seeking to build up its own capital markets and reduce its reliance on London. The clash over where euro-denominated securities should be traded and cleared echoes the stand-off between regulators over trading of euro-denominated shares inside the bloc if there is a no-deal Brexit.  Britain has yet to formally respond to that move.  Under EU rules, a no-deal Brexit would mean that EU market users would not be allowed to use platforms in London to trade contracts like interest rate swaps and credit default swaps in the \u201cover-the-counter\u201d (OTC) or unlisted contracts market.  The contracts are heavily traded by banks and companies to shield themselves against adverse moves in borrowing costs and bonds of companies defaulting.  Users would have to use alternatives inside the bloc, or those already endorsed by the EU in the United States or elsewhere. The EU rule is known as the derivatives trading obligation or DTO.  \u201cTo sum up, as with many other pieces of legislation, the DTO presents challenges in a post Brexit context,\u201d Robert Ophele, chair of France\u2019s markets watchdog AMF, told derivatives industry body ISDA\u2019s European conference.  \u201cI believe these can be overcome in a pragmatic and meaningful way by focusing the DTO on euro denominated instruments,\u201d Ophele said.  The DTO includes sterling denominated derivatives contracts, which Ophele said could be removed and would be traded in London.  \u201cAbsent such clarification, we will not be able to avoid overlaps or worse, arbitrage. I do hope that such a pragmatic approach will prevail,\u201d Ophele said.  He was responding to Andrew Bailey, chief executive of Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, who said on Monday it was for the EU to act to avoid overlaps in derivatives trading.  \u201cCurrently all OTC derivatives subject to the EU DTO have their main pool of liquidity on a UK venue,\u201d Bailey said on Monday.  \u201cWithout action, EU firms may lose access to UK liquidity pools and liquidity would be fragmented, harming both markets,\u201d Bailey said.  Ophele said it was obvious that Brexit will trigger a shift in some liquidity from London.  There are 11 trading platforms in the EU27 that market participants could use, with nearly 40 in the United States endorsed by the EU, along with five in Singapore.","343":"LONDON, June 11 (Reuters) - A new European Union law requiring closer scrutiny of foreign clearing houses used by customers from the bloc has been simplified after the United States threatened retaliation.  The law was triggered by Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc as the London Stock Exchange\u2019s LCH clearing house clears the bulk of interest rate swaps denominated in euros.  U.S. regulators threatened retaliatory measures if Brussels began to closely supervise U.S clearers such as CME Group and ICE (Intercontinental Exchange), saying it would increase their costs.  Brussels had dismissed the threats as \u201cblackmail\u201d but proposals for implementing the law published by the European Commission on Thursday rejected the catch-all approach recommended by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU watchdog that will supervise foreign clearers.  The commission, the EU\u2019s executive, said its proposals streamlined and simplified ESMA\u2019s approach, making it easier and substantially cheaper for foreign clearers to predict how closely they will be supervised.  Foreign clearers used by customers from the EU will now fall into two tiers with different levels of supervision.  A clearer will only have to give ESMA the sort of access usually reserved to domestic regulators if it is deemed to be \u201csystemic\u201d. Otherwise, it will only have basic ESMA supervision.  A clearer will be deemed systemic if it clears more than a trillion euros of securities transactions denominated in EU currencies in a year, or its notional outstanding amount of swaps positions was over a trillion euros.  An industry official said the proposals mean that no U.S. clearing house is likely to fall into the tier attracting heightened ESMA supervision.  The EU has long wanted euro clearing to be based in the bloc rather than predominately in London and long-term EU access for the LCH has still to be determined.  LCH cleared swaps worth a notional 117 trillion euros ($133 trillion) in the 12 months to June 10, indicating it will almost certainly be deemed a systemic clearer under the new EU law.  LCH declined to comment on the proposals.

ICE, which runs futures and equities exchanges, as well as clearing houses and data services, reported its strongest quarter ever, with record revenues, despite \u201chighly uncertain times,\u201d ICE Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Sprecher said.  The company had a profit of $1.28 per share after stripping out one-time items like acquisition expenses. That topped analysts\u2019 average expectations by 4 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The pandemic also led ICE to temporarily shutter the NYSE trading floor and move to fully electronic trading for the first time in the Big Board\u2019s 223-year history after traders and an ICE employee at 11 Wall Street tested positive for the novel coronavirus.  Market data since the March 23 NYSE floor closure highlight the value floor traders provide investors, Sprecher said on a call with analysts.  \u201cOur data shows that market participants save millions of dollars a day when the floor is operating, thanks to tighter spreads and more efficient auction price discovery,\u201d he said.  The NYSE released a study that looked at trading statistics in U.S. corporate stocks with market caps above $500 million, between Feb. 20 and March 20, a period that included the fastest-ever 30% market drop. It compared that with how stocks traded after the March 23 floor closure until April 15, when the market clawed back a chunk of its losses in response to massive government stimulus programs.  The results showed that floor traders dampened volatility, with average bid-ask spreads on the NYSE widening out to 41.6 basis points after the floor closure from 29.1 basis points in the prior period, the study said.  It also showed that when traders were on the floor, there was substantially more actionable liquidity in the final half hour of trading, when about 20% of U.S. trading happens.  The NYSE will coordinate with local authorities and reopen the trading floor \u201conce the time is right,\u201d Sprecher said.  The NYSE on Tuesday said it will open its NYSE Arca Options trading floor in San Francisco on May 4.  ICE\u2019s net income was $650 million, or $1.17 per share, in the quarter, up from $484 million, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier.  Total revenue was up 22.7% at $1.6 billion.","345":"March 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street analysts wasted no time in raising forecasts for exchange operators CME Group Inc and Nasdaq Inc after last month\u2019s historic stock market volatility, but industry watchers warned the companies may suffer if the selloff becomes deeper and more prolonged.  The stock, currency and commodity trading platform providers who make more money the more times investors trade on their systems have been struggling for years with decreased volumes driven by persistently low volatility, which keeps traders out of markets.  When volatility rises, as it did in a U.S. stock market selloff at the start of February, it pulls up the return banks, brokers and investors make on individual transactions because the spreads between where they bought and sold in the market become wider.  \u201cHigh volumes directly translates into revenue for exchange operators,\u201d said Stephen Biggar, an analyst with Argus Research Corp, who raised his first-quarter earnings estimate for CME by 30 percent for the first quarter of 2018, attributing a third of that change to the selloff.  \u201cCompanies such as CME, (and other exchange operators) will definitely see some positive effects of the February volatility in their first quarter earnings.\u201d  However, Biggar and others say that more prolonged periods of volatility tend in the end to hurt operators as skittish investors get scared out of the market where trades carry too much risk.  \u201cWhen there is a protracted sell-off, there is a lot of fear about the future,\u201d says Matthew Granski, an analyst with Miracle Mile Advisors based in Los Angeles, California.  \u201cIn 2008, there were many investors who thought that the market would never recover. When expectations are diminished, stocks suffer because investors think their future earnings will be lower.\u201d  CME and Cboe trading volumes hit record highs of 1.35 million contracts and 10.47 million contracts, respectively, on Feb. 6 when Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge - the CBOE VIX index surged to its highest since April 2015.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average index also recorded its highest trading volumes ever on the same day and CME said on Friday that February was its biggest ever month of trading with volumes reaching 27.3 million contracts - up from 19 million in January.  The comparison with 2008 is striking. At that time, volumes of equities trades doubled as the collapse of Lehman Brothers blew the starting whistle on a global market meltdown.  Volumes stayed high in October in that year, but thereafter fell back steadily and by August 2009 were lower than they had been a year earlier.

FILE PHOTO: An employee holds gold bars before the refining process at AGR (African Gold Refinery) in Entebbe, Uganda, October 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Baz Ratner\/File Photo  The coronavirus has created a bonanza for investment banks dealing in gold, silver and other precious metals by triggering massive investor purchases and rupturing the normal workings of the market.  But JPMorgan has dominated, growing its share of the market.  The U.S. bank\u2019s revenue by mid-November accounts for at least half of the $1.7 billion to $2 billion that consultancy McKinsey CIB Insights estimates the top 10 investment banks combined will make this year from precious metals, mostly gold.  Its commodities division is on track to bring in more than $1.5 billion this year and could challenge Goldman Sachs for the title of top earner, the sources said.  JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  Individual investment banks have rarely made more than $1 billion in commodities in recent years, and none has ever before earned more than around $600 million in precious metals in a single year, said George Kuznetsov at McKinsey CIB Insights.  (For a graphic on Commodities bonanza, click )  JPMorgan is the largest bank in the United States and one of the biggest in the world.  It sits at the heart of the global bullion market, and its activities span trading physical bars to derivatives, running vaults and clearing trades in London, the biggest trade hub.  REVENUE WINDFALL  Driving profit has been the clamour for gold and silver from investors, mainly in Europe and North America, worried the coronavirus pandemic and money-printing by central banks could devalue other assets.  These investors pushed gold prices to record highs above $2,000 an ounce earlier this year.  Added to that are profits earned on the Comex futures exchange in New York, where supply issues earlier this year made it more lucrative for those with access to physical gold to trade precious metals.  Banks such as JPMorgan took advantage of opportunities on Comex and helped clients do the same.  JPMorgan\u2019s client business dwarfs that of others.  Data from CME Group, which runs Comex, show JPMorgan\u2019s clients accounted for one-third of all trade in gold bars registered with the exchange in October, and more than two fifths in June.  Like other big banks, JPMorgan was able to get and ship metal cheaply and in large quantities when other, smaller traders could not, sources said.  The revenue windfall will likely fade as trading on Comex reverts to normal patterns, but high gold prices and interest from investors mean this business will remain profitable.  \u201c2020 is going to be an outlier year,\u201d said Kuznetsov at McKinsey.","347":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. senators are calling for investigations of record profit margins for beef processors like Tyson Foods TSN.N and Cargill, after ranchers complained surging meat prices due to coronavirus hoarding did not translate into higher cattle prices.

Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa wrote on Twitter that U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Justice and Commodity Futures Trading Commission probes may be needed to determine why ranchers did not benefit from soaring meat demand.  \u201cBeef is flying off grocery shelves but farmers are seeing prices go down,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cIf packers are illegally manipulating markets during crisis, we need USDA & DOJ & CFTC to investigate + help farmers.

But cattle producers are operating at a net loss, four U.S. senators from South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana told the Justice Department in a letter that called for a price-fixing investigation.  Cargill said it is a committed buyer in the cash market for cattle, which was less impacted than futures. Tyson said it wants cattle producers to succeed and paid them a premium last week.  \u201cThis is an uncertain and unprecedented time, where food service beef demand has come to an immediate and virtual standstill, while retail demand has increased,\u201d Tyson said.  USDA said it was working with CFTC to ensure transparency and integrity in agricultural markets.  Live cattle futures LCJ0 dropped 3.5% on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange over the last three weeks amid worries the virus would shut slaughterhouses, while prices for beef that meat companies ship to wholesale buyers jumped about 20%.  Futures sank as managed funds liquidated long positions, or bets prices will rise, said Cassie Fish, a beef expert who formerly worked for Tyson. It was the market\u2019s biggest event-driven decline in more than 45 years, she said.  \u201cThey decided to get out,\u201d Fish said. \u201cIt was like a stampede.\u201d  Farmers and processors use futures to offset the risk of producing meat, and futures are intended to reflect the underlying cash market.

Representatives of EU states and the European Parliament cited \u201cadverse circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d, a statement from the Council of EU states said.  The rules would allow market participants to choose where they want to clear their listed derivatives trades, pitting clearers like the London Stock Exchange's LSE.L LCH, Deutsche Boerse's DB1Gn.DE Eurex, and ICE ICE.N against each other.  The rules, part of the EU\u2019s MiFID II securities law, were due to come into force on July 4 and will now be delayed a year until July 4, 2021.  They were controversial in the making, with lawmakers\u2019 concerns over the potential impact on financial stability disputed by proponents of greater competition in markets.  The European Securities and Markets Authority said on June 11 that market disruption from COVID-19 could increase operational risks by limiting the capacity of clearers to assess access requests and manage the migration of transactions.  Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority said it backed ESMA\u2019s stance.

FILE PHOTO: Flames emerge from flare stacks at Nahr Bin Umar oil field, north of Basra, Iraq September 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Essam Al-Sudani\/File Photo  The extent of the damage that the coronavirus pandemic had inflicted on the oil industry came into focus on April 20, when the U.S. benchmark WTI CLc1 contract plunged to minus $38 a barrel.  The virus destroyed so much fuel demand as billions of people stopped traveling that there was almost nowhere left to store the oil. So on the day before the May contract expired, investors stuck with barrels had to pay buyers to take it away.  A month later, governments around the world are slowly lifting travel restrictions and there are signs that demand is recovering from its nadir. Oil prices have staged something of a recovery, with U.S. crude rising on Monday to more than $30 a barrel and hitting its highest level since March 16.  As oil producers worldwide cut output rapidly, the pressure on storage is easing: U.S. government data this week showed crude inventories fell. [EIA\/S]  \u201cThere\u2019s clearly a different feel to the oil market heading into this contract expiry, with production cuts having been enforced globally, either through deals or unilaterally,\u201d said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.  \u201cBut will it be enough to avert another panic selling moment? The odds have certainly reduced ... there\u2019s a fine line between confidence and complacency and we can only hope that line hasn\u2019t been crossed or early next week it could quickly unravel.\u201d  The positive mood was reinforced as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell issued an optimistic outlook for economic recovery later this year.  \u201cAssuming there is not a second wave of the coronavirus, I think you will see the economy recover steadily through the second half of this year,\u201d Powell said Sunday night in broadcast remarks.  Still, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that oversees futures and options trading, issued a rare warning on Wednesday to exchange operators and brokerages ahead of expiry, telling them they need to protect markets from manipulation and potentially intervene to protect customers.  Several brokerages or futures commission merchants (FCMs), including discount giant TD Ameritrade Corp, have restricted customers from buying new positions in some crude contracts since the price crash.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which hosts the trade in WTI futures, last week raised maintenance margins for the June contract by 20%. That would make it too expensive for some smaller retail investors to hold many open positions ahead of expiry.  Asked about CME\u2019s expectations, a spokesperson said the exchange would not speculate on whether prices will be negative for any product and referred Reuters to notices about its systems\u2019 ability to accommodate negative pricing.  Last month, the CME ordered the United States Oil Fund LP USO.P, the largest oil-focused exchange-traded product in the country, to limit its position in the June contract to no more than 10,000 lots. The fund has issued filings to tell investors it has gone further than that - and has spread holdings through contracts expiring in July, August and September.  Open interest in June is already dwindling as a result of those moves, standing at about 75,000 lots on Thursday, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. That was down from nearly 135,000 lots on Wednesday.  On April 17, two days before the May contract expired, open interest stood at about 108,600 lots.  (Graphic: Investors shift oil trades after -$40 disaster - )  PLUNGE AFTERMATH  The WTI contract is physically settled, meaning the holder at expiry must take delivery of the oil in Cushing, Oklahoma. Retail investors keen to take a punt on oil prices through futures contracts have no interest in actually owning barrels of real crude.  Last month, retail investors got caught holding contracts close to expiry when buyers were scarce and storage at Cushing was effectively full, sending them into a frenzy to sell.\u201dBluntly, small retail traders had no business being in the May contract at that time,\u201d said Henry Lichtenstein and Brett Friedman at risk management advisors Winhall Risk Analytics. Those traders\u2019 FCMs, the exchange or the CFTC should have stepped in and prohibited them from trading, they said.  \u201cThis would have avoided a financial effect on futures traders due to the allowance of negative prices that we conservatively estimate in the $3.8 billion range.\u201d  The mess last month threatened the contract\u2019s status as one of the two top global oil price gauges, according to Patricia Hemsworth, senior vice president of energy risk management at PGM Commodity Services.  \u201cI believe the debacle of the May delivery threatened a benchmark which has provided the industry with an invaluable price discovery and risk transfer tool for 37 years,\u201d she said.  Among those impacted were investors in derivatives contracts based on the WTI that are traded on exchanges as far afield as China and Russia.  Bank of China (BoC) 601988.SS3988.HK said it had hired lawyers to write to the CME urging it to investigate reasons behind abnormal fluctuations on April 21. Retail investors may have lost more than 9 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) from BoC's crude oil product, financial news outlet Caixin reported last month, citing unnamed sources.  Another factor that could help avoid a repeat of the crunch this month is that inventories at Cushing have begun to decline, falling by 3 million barrels last week, U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed. That should free up some space for those taking delivery of the June contract.  (Graphic: WTI crude prices versus Cushing oil stockpiles - )  In physical markets, the forum for buying and selling actual oil rather than futures contracts, activity slowed down ahead of expiry.

The bumper number underlines a dramatic change on Comex since March, when the coronavirus crisis weakened links between New York, the world\u2019s main gold futures trading venue, and London, the biggest centre for storing and trading physical bullion.  The assumption that gold could be quickly shipped from London to New York to settle contracts broke down when lockdowns grounded passenger planes used to transport it and closed refineries that shape metal to fit CME specifications.  Since then, futures prices have typically been higher than gold prices elsewhere in the world, incentivising traders to ship metal to New York to profit on the difference.  Stockpiles in Comex-registered vaults of gold deliverable against the exchange\u2019s main contract have leaped to 1,016 tonnes from 276 tonnes in late March, CME data shows.  Deliveries against active contracts have soared - from just 8,234 contracts representing 26 tonnes of gold in February to 31,666 contracts (98 tonnes) in April and 55,102 contracts (171 tonnes) in June.  On Thursday, traders said they intended to deliver against 32,732 contracts expiring in August, according to the CME.

FILE PHOTO: A liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker is tugged towards a thermal power station in Futtsu, east of Tokyo, Japan, November 13, 2017. REUTERS\/Issei Kato\/File Photo  Over the past two months, commodity price agency S&P Global Platts and Australia-headquartered LNG trading marketplace Global LNG Exchange (GLX) facilitated the first transparent physical trades in their platforms.  It was the first time in nearly a decade since Platts kicked off its Asian LNG derivative price assessment that it disclosed trading parties of a physical trade on its platform.  Pricing transparency is critical to boost liquidity in commodity markets but is often tough to do particularly in cash contracts with participants wary about exposing trading positions.  LNG producers also prefer fixed, long-term contracts because they provide steady revenues needed to fund multi-billion dollar projects.  But the LNG trading landscape is slowly changing, as more market participants push for transparency and Japan\u2019s JERA, the world\u2019s biggest LNG buyer, and leading merchants like Vitol expand their trading desks.  \u201cThese first few transparent bids or offers are the first steps to encourage greater market participation in using the (Platts) marker to price cargoes,\u201d said Edmund Siau, analyst with energy consultancy FGE.  Platts started publishing a daily Asian LNG price assessment in 2009. But it was only in 2016 that volumes picked up, then more than tripled in 2017. Volumes in January-May this year have already surpassed last year\u2019s, according to Platts data.  To view a graphic on Platts JKM LNG swaps cleared through ICE & CME, click: reut.rs\/2KGXlYi  And for the first time, Platts last week published the counterparties of one LNG trade for its pricing process, three weeks after receiving its first transparent bid from commodity trader Trafigura.  \u201cWe have seen a significant number of market participants that have stated they would like to see a more transparent (price) process,\u201d said Jonty Rushforth, senior director of energy pricing at Platts.  Platts has approved six other entities in the transparent bidding process including Britain\u2019s BP, Japan\u2019s Itochu, Swiss Vitol, Singapore\u2019s Pavilion Gas and Diamond Gas International, a subsidiary of Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Corp.  Perth-headquartered Global LNG Exchange (GLX), an online platform for physical cargoes launched in April 2017, saw its first trade done in May this year as its members more than doubled to 44 from last December, most of them from Asia, which imports over 70 percent of the world\u2019s LNG.  GLX Chief Executive Damien Criddle said the platform has received four tenders since its launch.  LONG WAY TO GO  Petronas LNG, a subsidiary of Malaysia\u2019s state-owned Petronas and a major producer of the fuel, completed the first GLX deal in late May.  \u201cTraders spend a lot of time talking on a bilateral basis with other traders to see whether they can sell spot cargoes,\u201d Ahmad Adly Alias, vice president of Petronas LNG marketing and trading division said at a conference in late May, adding that a platform like GLX was a more effective way for price discovery.  On Tuesday, CME Group Inc said it will develop the first physically deliverable U.S. LNG futures contract on its New York Mercantile Exchange.  Still, LNG has a long way to go before reaching the level of liquidity and transparency in oil - by far the world\u2019s most traded commodity - but which only came after many years. Steelmaking raw material iron ore only shifted to transparent spot pricing after four decades of yearly-set contracts.  Majority of LNG in Asia remains under opaque long-term contracts linked to the price of oil, as producers opt for steady revenues to fund LNG export projects, some of which have cost $50 billion to develop, said FGE\u2019s Siau.  \u201cUntil providers of project debt and equity are comfortable with the risks and rewards of using a spot LNG index, we expect the proportion of spot LNG available will be limited,\u201d he said.","358":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The volume of oil sitting in 300 steel tanks in a nine-square-mile radius in Cushing, Oklahoma has long been a key barometer for the health of U.S. crude supply and the nation\u2019s benchmark for daily trading of billions of dollars in the commodity.  FILE PHOTO: Crude oil storage tanks are seen from above at the Cushing oil hub, in Cushing, Oklahoma, U.S., March 24, 2016. REUTERS\/Nick Oxford\/File Photo  But those tanks could soon drain to levels near effectively empty, even as U.S. oil production soars past a new record of 10.4 million barrels per day.  Oil supplies have fallen before in Cushing for a variety of seasonal or market-driven reasons. But this time, there is no shortage of crude in the market. In fact, U.S. production is straining pipeline and storage capacity.  The declining volumes stored at Cushing reflects a more permanent shift, underscoring the hub\u2019s waning influence as the primary measuring stick for the U.S. oil market and the leading barometer of future supply, demand and prices.  (For a graphic of falling oil inventories at Cushing, see: tmsnrt.rs\/2GRh5GR )  Companies are now spending millions of dollars building infrastructure to facilitate trading and storage elsewhere, such as in Houston and other Gulf Coast ports.  That could pave the way for a change in the U.S. benchmark oil price, used to value tens of billions of dollars of crude and futures contracts every day. The current benchmark - called West Texas Intermediate crude, or \u201cWTI\u201d - has been derived from the price of physical oil delivered to Cushing for more than three decades.  Traders and major global crude buyers have advocated replacing WTI with a new benchmark futures contract that would reflect the value of crude delivered to the Gulf Coast.  The price of oil in Cushing - which bills itself as \"the pipeline crossroads of the world\" - is used to value crude grades produced around the United States and some oil imported from Canada, Mexico, and South America. Prices at the hub also provide the basis for an average of 1.3 million WTI futures contracts CL-TOT - worth about $82 billion at current prices - that change hands on the CME Group's New York Mercantile Exchange every day, making it one of the world's most actively traded commodities.  But as more pipelines are built to take oil from U.S. shale fields to Gulf refineries or for export markets, much of the crude produced in the giant Permian Basin oilfield in Texas and elsewhere no longer passes through Cushing.  Instead, producers are increasingly shipping directly to seaports such as Houston, where vessels carry the oil to dozens of countries worldwide. That reflects a major transformation in global crude flows since the United States lifted a four-decade ban on oil exports in late 2015. Some traders and buyers argue the benchmark needs to change to reflect this.  Joshua Wade, a crude oil marketer in Oklahoma, sees the benchmark delivery point moving south before long.  \u201cThat\u2019s the direction it\u2019s moving,\u201d he said. \u201cAs opposed to importing, now you\u2019re exporting through the same infrastructure ... The oil capital of the nation is in Houston.\u201d  Inventories in Cushing fell to 28.2 million barrels in early March, lowest in more than three years.  Analysts say a level of 20 million barrels is effectively empty. That\u2019s because tank design necessitates a minimum volume of crude be kept on hand to maintain the physical integrity of the complex and to allow for blending different crude grades to comply with pipeline specifications.  \u201cThere has been a major structural shift in crude flows within the U.S.,\u201d said John Coleman, senior research analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. \u201cI think Cushing is rapidly losing its relevance.\u201d  A CENTURY-OLD WAY STATION  Cushing got its distinction in the early 1920s when tanks sprung up to store oil en route from Oklahoma and Texas to major metropolitan areas and refineries in the Midwest.  In 1983, it became the delivery point for the newly-launched WTI futures contract CLc1. Because the U.S. relied on imports - and banned exports - Cushing was key for traders to gauge domestic supply trends.  BP\u2019s former head of crude trading, Donald Porteous, earned the nickname \u201cthe King of Cushing\u201d because of his deep understanding of supply logistics in the Oklahoma town - a strategy that often earned him more money than BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley.  Porteous, now retired, declined to comment for this story.  Now, new pipeline projects head straight from west Texas to the Gulf of Mexico, a route well south of Cushing. Lately, Permian Basin prices have declined because pipelines can\u2019t be built fast enough to get crude to the Gulf, even as pipeline firms have added about 600,000 bpd in capacity since late last year, according to data compiled by Reuters.  \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure we\u2019re ahead of the pinch points for producers to bring product to refiners or to export,\u201d Greg Armstrong, chief executive of Plains All American, said at a recent industry conference.  Projects in the works could boost outgoing pipeline capacity from the Permian from 2.7 million bpd in March to more than 4.5 million bpd by the end of 2019, according to energy industry information provider Genscape.  Meanwhile, the Dakota Access pipeline started shipping oil last year, running out of North Dakota\u2019s Bakken shale region to the Gulf - bypassing Cushing. And Marathon Petroleum is considering reversing its Capline crude line to bring barrels from Illinois to the Gulf.  A BENCHMARK SHIFT?  For now, traders watch the price differential between WTI and London-based Brent crude to determine where to ferry shipments globally.  But traders say the price of physical trades in Houston is growing more important as a barometer for shippers. Earlier this year, even as the WTI crude discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 narrowed, Houston's discount to Brent remained steady at about $1.60 a barrel, analysts said, helping buoy export demand.  As pipeline capacity to the Gulf has increased, and storage has expanded, demand to park barrels in Cushing has waned, said Carlin Conner, chief executive at SemGroup Corp SEMG.N, which operates about 7.6 million barrels of crude oil storage in Cushing.  A spokesman for Magellan Midstream Partners, which owns about 12 million barrels of Cushing storage, said it will remain important because of its connections to the Gulf and Midwest.  Cushing is also connected via pipeline to the Gulf, 500 miles to the south, and can offer cheaper storage than what\u2019s available on the coast, said SemGroup\u2019s Conner.  \u201cI believe Cushing\u2019s next chapter,\u201d he said, \u201cis that it\u2019s going to become an offsite Gulf Coast storage center.\u201d","359":"NEW YORK, Nov 6 (Reuters) - CME Group\u2019s newly launched crude oil futures contract deliverable at Houston had about 26 lots that changed hands on the first day of trading on Monday, according to data from the exchange:  * The January Houston contract ended the session Monday at $69.62 a barrel while benchmark January U.S. crude futures delivered at Cushing, Oklahoma, settled at $63.21 a barrel.  * CME\u2019s new Houston futures contract, deliverable at Enterprise Products Partners LP\u2019s Houston system, can also be traded versus WTI Cushing as an exchange-listed spread.  * Rival Intercontinental Exchange Inc reported two weeks ago that 446 lots of its West Texas Intermediate oil contract, deliverable at Magellan Midstream Partners LP\u2019s East Houston terminal, changed hands on its first day of trading, spread across about three delivery months.  * The U.S. Gulf Coast, and in particular Houston, has gained prominence as a trading hub since Washington lifted a decades-old ban on exports.

The BoE wants the market to substitute Libor in financial contracts such as interest rate futures with its own \u201crisk-free\u201d interest rate known as Sonia or Sterling Overnight Index Average.  Banks were fined billions of dollars for trying to manipulate Libor, which measures borrowing costs between lenders. Risk-free rates are seen as harder to rig.

It is one of two new futures contracts the CME is launching on Oct. 1 to help replace Libor in markets.  The other contract responds to calls from market participants for a quarterly International Monetary Market (IMM) contract, which mirrors existing Libor futures.  Creating liquidity in futures contracts based on risk-free rates is seen as crucial for successful migration from Libor.  Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority wants migration by the end of 2021, saying that after this deadline, banks may no longer want to keep submitting the quotes needed for compiling Libor, meaning it could disappear and leave contracts without a pricing reference.  The CME is going head to head with two rival exchanges, the Intercontinental Exchange and London Stock Exchange, who have already launched futures contracts based on Sonia.

Spot gold rose 1.1% to $1,631.05 per ounce as of 14:56 p.m. EDT (1756 GMT).  \u201cMore countries are expected to release some sort of stimulus packages which is a big event for gold. In addition to it, unemployment claims jumped. That tells the investors that QE is going to have more longevity,\u201d said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors.  Central banks have been turning to quantitative easing (QE), or large-scale purchases of government bonds and other financial assets to pump money into the economy.  Data showed a record high of more than 3 million Americans filed claims for unemployment benefits last week as strict measures to contain the pandemic hit economic activity.  \u201cIt\u2019s an indication that things are slowing down dramatically. The worse data you can get right now, the market should respond favourably, because that provides more ammunition for the Fed to be keep on stimulating,\u201d Matousek added.  The dollar dropped to a near one-week low against rivals, making gold cheaper for holders of other currencies.  Wall Street stocks jumped as investors bet on more stimulus measures.  The U.S. Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly backed a $2 trillion bill aimed at helping unemployed workers and industries hurt by the outbreak.  This came after the U.S. Federal Reserve said on Monday it would buy as many bonds as needed to stabilize financial markets and backstop direct loans to companies.  \u201cExtraordinary steps by the Fed this week, including uncapping the size of asset purchases and buying investment grade bonds, should push real interest rates deeper into negative territory and in turn support demand for real assets like gold,\u201d said UBS commodities analyst Giovanni Staunovo in a note.  Gold market participants remained concerned about a supply squeeze following a sharp divergence in London and New York prices as the coronavirus closed precious metals refineries.  U.S. exchange operator CME Group on Tuesday announced a new gold futures contract to combat price volatility caused by the shutdown of gold supply routes, but traders and bankers said it would not immediately calm markets.

He will also lead the LSE's efforts to woo oil giant Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE to London for what is expected to be the world's largest initial public offering.  \u201cDavid is a leader with great experience in the financial market infrastructure sector ... as well as capital markets experience in both developed and emerging markets,\u201d LSE Chairman Donald Brydon said in a statement.  \u201cHe is well known for his robust intellect and partnership approach with clients and colleagues alike,\u201d Brydon added.  Group CFO David Warren, who was acting CEO, will continue as the company\u2019s finance boss.  TAKEOVER TARGET?  The LSE is seen in the market as a takeover target rather than a predator with rivals Intercontinental Exchange ICE.N and CME CME.O in the United States long seen as suitors, analysts said.  \u201cWe think the appointment of Mr. Schwimmer, a former M&A banker, will allow LSE to continue to look for inorganic growth opportunities, in line with LSE\u2019s strategy,\u201d UBS analyst Michael Werner said in a note to clients.  UBS sees no big change in the LSE\u2019s focus on developing its suite of indexes and the LCH clearing unit.  Hedge fund TCI, an LSE investor, predicted a 15 billion pound bid for the group from ICE and CME during an investor conference call earlier this year.  Rolet\u2019s exit triggered a fight between Brydon and TCI, whose attempt to push him out was eventually defeated at a shareholder meeting in December.  Brydon has said he will not stand for re-election at the annual general meeting in 2019.  Since TCI\u2019s defeat, LSE shares have risen more than 14 percent as investors bet on a takeover approach after a planned tie-up with Deutsche Boerse collapsed. LSE shares were up marginally at 4240 pence at 1010 GMT.  TCI holds a 5.18 percent stake in LSE, and its founder Chris Hohn, declined to comment on Friday when contacted by Reuters.  Rolet was credited with turning LSE into a diversified exchange group by buying a controlling stake in LCH, one of the world\u2019s biggest clearing houses, and expanding the bourse\u2019s activities in stock indexes.  Under Rolet\u2019s leadership, LSE was unable to seal a merger with Deutsche Boerse, the third attempt at an Anglo-German tie up.  \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been an orthodox transition, but we\u2019re pleased to see clear leadership being put in place,\u201d said a top-20 investor in LSE.  LSE emerged from what was a troubling 2017 with a 47 percent profit jump despite turgid markets.

(Updates prices) By Nakul Iyer July 1 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose to their highest in nearly eight years on Wednesday as a spike in coronavirus cases sparked concerns over the economic recovery from the pandemic and boosted demand for safe-havens. Spot gold hit its highest since early October 2012 at $1,788.96 in early trade, and was little changed at $1,779.95 per ounce by 1205 GMT. U.S. gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,794.00 per ounce. \"Uncertainty about the coronavirus, particularly in the U.S., which could put the brakes on an economic recovery, and the ultra-loose monetary policy of central banks are giving support to gold,\" said Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann. A rise in negative-yielding global bonds was also adding to the metal's appeal, he said. Lower bond yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-interest bearing gold. But with investment demand likely to be higher than jewellery consumption this year, especially with practically no physical demand in Asia, gold's price gains are \"somewhat fragile\", he added. The United States recorded its biggest one-day spike in COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic on Tuesday, with the government's top infectious disease expert warning that infections could double. However, keeping a lid on gold's gains, the U.S. dollar steadied close to a near one-month high. A stronger dollar makes holding gold more expensive for other currency holders. Reflecting high investor demand, holdings in the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust , increased by 211.9 tonnes, or nearly 22%, in the second quarter. \"Technically the situation remains firmly bullish with investors betting on further (money) printing activity from central banks,\" said ActivTrades chief analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa. CME Group said it would expand delivery options for its new gold contract to include vaults in London as well as in New York after disruption to supply routes caused havoc in gold markets earlier this year.

Meanwhile, daily turnover of U.S. Treasuries decelerated to its slowest level in more than five years due to low volatility in the bond market, NEX data showed.  NEX, which runs one of the largest FX trading platforms, said average daily traded volumes rose to $81.9 billion in July from $81.6 billion in 2017.  The volumes are only for cash market trading.  Electronic trading platforms enjoyed a surge in currency volumes to record highs earlier this year, although the growth appears to have slowed considerably in July.  NEX said trading in European repo was up 10 percent from a year ago, while daily turnover in U.S. repo and Treasuries slipped 1 percent and 14 percent, respectively, from the year before.  Daily Treasuries trading volume averaged $125.4 billion last month, down 20 percent from June. This marked the most sluggish daily pace since $120.5 billion in April 2013, NEX data showed.  NEX provides fixed income trading technology through its BrokerTec platform, which is the market leader for electronic trading for Treasuries and many European fixed-income products.

FILE PHOTO: The London Stock Exchange Group offices are seen in the City of London, Britain, December 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo  The law was triggered by Britain's departure from the European Union as the London Stock Exchange's LSE.L LCH clears the bulk of interest rate swaps denominated in euros.  U.S. regulators threatened retaliation if Brussels began to closely supervise U.S. clearers, such as CME Group CME.O and ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) ICE.N, saying it would increase their costs.  Brussels had dismissed the threats as blackmail, but proposals for implementing the law published by the European Commission on Thursday rejected the catch-all approach recommended by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU watchdog that will supervise foreign clearers.  The commission, the EU\u2019s executive, said its proposals streamlined and simplified ESMA\u2019s approach, making it easier and cheaper for foreign clearers to predict the level of supervision.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the U.S. regulator that had threatened retaliation, said the proposals were a positive step that balanced the need to maintain EU financial stability with deference to the home regulator of U.S. clearers.  With deference a \u201ctwo-way street\u201d, the CFTC would continue to consider how it can show further deference to the EU, as appropriate, CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert said.  CME declined to comment, and ICE had no immediate comment.  Foreign clearers used by EU customers will fall into two tiers with different levels of supervision.  A clearer will only have to give ESMA the sort of access usually reserved for domestic regulators if it is deemed to be systemic. Otherwise, it will only have basic ESMA supervision.  A clearer will be deemed systemic if it clears more than a trillion euros of securities transactions denominated in EU currencies in a year, or its notional outstanding amount of swaps positions exceeds a trillion euros.  Lawmakers from the U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 sub-committee on commodity exchanges said the proposals addressed substantive concerns by clarifying that U.S. clearers will not be deemed systemic and therefore spared greater scrutiny.  The sub-committee had made it clear it would not accept any form of EU control over U.S.-based clearers, they said.  The EU has long wanted euro clearing to be based in the bloc rather than predominately in London and long-term EU access for the LCH has still to be determined.  LCH cleared swaps worth a notional 117 trillion euros between January and June 10, indicating it will almost certainly be deemed a systemic clearer under the new EU law.

The Wells notice was issued to the index provider for failing to provide sufficient disclosures on some volatility-related indexes in 2018, according to the filing here from Tuesday.  The SEC is planning to file an enforcement action against the index provider, a joint venture between S&P Global and exchange operator CME Group, the filing said.  \u201cThe proposed action would allege violations of federal securities laws with respect to the absence of disclosure of a quality assurance mechanism and the impact of that mechanism on certain volatility related index values published on one business day in 2018,\u201d S&P Global said in the filing.  \u201cThe Staff\u2019s recommendation may involve a civil injunctive action, a cease and desist proceeding, disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and civil money penalties.\u201d  A Wells notice does not necessarily mean the SEC will bring any action against the company or that the recipient has violated any law.

Wild swings in crypto asset prices have prompted central bankers to warn investors they could lose every penny. It is unclear at times which financial rules, if any, apply to the sector or if there is legal authority to regulate it.  Start ups have begun issuing new digital currencies via initial coin offerings (ICOs), raising concern among regulators over investor protection.  The aim of the new framework is to spot any financial stability risks early enough to take action.  The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation for the Group of 20 Economies (G20), said the framework focuses on how risks from crypto asset markets could spread to other parts of the financial system.  \u201cMonitoring the size and growth of crypto-asset markets is critical to understanding the potential size of wealth effects, should valuations fall,\u201d the FSB said in a statement on Monday.  \u201cThe use of leverage, and financial institution exposures to crypto-asset markets are important metrics of transmission of crypto-asset risks to the broader financial system.\u201d  The aim of the new framework is to spot any financial stability risks early enough to take action.  But the FSB cautioned that data is still patchy at times in a rapidly developing market that can be fragmented and opaque. It would assess whether the framework will need extra data at a later stage.  Moves to formally monitor the sector forms part of a compromise in March between G20 members like France, who wanted more radical action, and other countries who preferred treading lightly for now.  The FSB framework also includes trading volumes, pricing, clearing and margining for derivatives linked to crypto assets, such as the bitcoin futures launched by CME Group last December.  Crypto assets in general and crypto asset trading platforms do not pose global financial stability risks, but they raise other significant concerns, including consumer and investor protection, market integrity and money laundering\/terrorism financing, the FSB said.  It said its affiliate, the Basel Committee, which writes bank capital standards, is conducting an \u201cinitial stocktake\u201d of banks\u2019 exposures to crypto assets.  The committee is also looking at whether regulators are forcing lenders to set aside capital against holdings of crypto assets, and considering whether to rewrite its rules to explicitly require such holdings to be covered.","370":"MANILA\/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Philippines exempted its financial trading platforms from strict coronavirus quarantine procedures on Tuesday, paving the way for the resumption of trading at its stock, bond and foreign exchange markets this week, government officials said.

Britain is due to quit the EU on Oct. 31, but has yet to agree a divorce settlement with Brussels.  Without a deal, EU regulators have said that EU-authorised investment firms can only trade shares listed in the bloc on platforms inside the EU, threatening London\u2019s central role in European share trading.

Haynes said he agreed with analysts who expect the exchange to be profitable in 2020. Its agreed acquisition of NEX Exchange, which Aquis will use to enter the listings market, is expected to obtain UK regulatory approval later this year.  Aquis accounts for 4.8% of European share trading, and Liberum analysts said on Tuesday they expect this to reach 10%. Haynes said that once Brexit uncertainty has ended, Aquis should flourish as investors return.  BREXIT FIRST MOVER  Aquis and rivals CBOE and Turquoise trade shares listed on national exchanges.  CBOE will offer trading in shares from all EU countries, apart from Britain, on its new Amsterdam platform on Oct. 1 regardless of what form Brexit takes later that month.  It means that European share trading will fragment, reversing years of efforts by the EU to create a seamless cross-border market that is cheaper and more efficient for investors to compete better with the United States for raising funds for companies to grow.  CBOE already accounts for about a fifth of share trading in EU shares, and Haynes said he was not worried that the U.S. rival will gain first mover advantage.  \u201cI don\u2019t think any real trading is going to take place until there is a no-deal Brexit. The real test will be on November 1, post-Brexit in a no-deal scenario,\u201d Haynes said.  Turquoise has not announced the start of trading in the Dutch financial capital.  Share trading is not the only financial activity leaving London to nibble away at the capital\u2019s role as a global financial centre.  In March CME moved about 230 billion euros of daily trading in euro-denominated repurchase agreements and government debt from London to a new hub in Amsterdam, with clearing of those contracts shifted from London to Paris.  The London Stock Exchange has moved trading in euro zone government bonds from London to Milan.

The move represents a gesture of goodwill by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) which has been at logger-heads with the European Union over proposed rules that could impede cross-border trading between the two markets.  Clearing houses sit in between trades to guarantee payment in the event either party defaults.  Eurex can currently clear interest rate swaps executed by its U.S. member bank firms but it has not been able to clear swaps for those firms\u2019 end-customers, such as hedge funds and asset managers, because its depository arrangements did not meet U.S. requirements.

According to the LBMA, its members last week traded 95 million ounces of gold in spot contracts, 46.5 million ounces in swaps and forward contracts, 4.1 million ounces in options and 5.4 million ounces in leases, loans and deposits.  That gives a daily average total of 30.2 million ounces - or 939 tonnes, the equivalent of 74 London double-decker busses.

The LBMA said it would publish the data once a week for around three months before moving to daily reporting. It also said it planned to begin publishing data for platinum and palladium.  The initiative is part of a wider move by the LBMA to make the gold market more transparent after pressure from regulators and accusations - some of which resulted in settlement payouts - that a number of banks and traders had manipulated prices.  Last year the LBMA began publishing monthly data showing how much gold and silver is stored in London\u2019s precious metals vaults - 7,684 tonnes of gold worth $309 billion and 34,901 tonnes of silver worth $18 billion, as of the end of June.","378":"LONDON (Reuters) - A surge in trading and booming demand for information services drove global exchange revenues to a record high in 2017, a report by Burton-Taylor International Consulting said on Tuesday.  Total global exchange industry revenue rose 8.1 percent in 2017 to $30.744 billion, Burton-Taylor, a subsidiary of TP ICAP TCAPI.L, found.  Intercontinental Exchange ICE.N retained the top spot in terms of revenue, followed by CME Group CME.O.  Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE remained third while LSE LSE.L edged ahead of Nasdaq NDAQ.O to nab the fourth spot with $2.52 billion revenues while Nasdaq managed $2.43 billion.  Margins remained strong across the industry, reporting an average 53.6 percent EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin in 2017.  Information services segments saw an average 9.1 percent increase in revenues as exchanges continued to push beyond real-time market data and into index and analytics services.  Rising trading volumes and higher margin interest revenues helped boost revenues in trading, clearing and settlement (TC&S) - the largest industry segment - up 6.4 percent.  CME Group remained the largest exchange for TC&S followed by Deutsche Boerse and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).  ICE held the biggest market share in the Americas while Deutsche Boerse was the biggest exchange in EMEA. Hong Kong Stock Exchange dominated the Asian market.

Spot gold gained 0.6% to $1,724.72 per ounce by 0804 GMT, having touched its highest since Nov. 2012 at $1,726.85 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,772.20.  \u201cThe concerns about the economic outlook are particularly supportive for gold. Liquidity (from the Federal Reserve) combined with the background of lower interest rates makes gold a much more attractive proposition,\u201d said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets.  But he warned that in the absence of new news, there could be \u201cmodest pull backs as investors and traders reposition themselves\u201d.  Many countries and central banks have taken fiscal and monetary measures to prop up their economies amid the coronavirus outbreak.  The Fed last week announced a $2.3 trillion stimulus package, while European Union finance ministers agreed on half-a-trillion euros worth of economic support.  The Fed stimulus aimed at injecting liquidity into the virus-hit U.S. economy tend to weigh on the dollar, which makes gold relatively cheaper to buy, while lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.  A steep economic downturn and massive rescue spending will nearly quadruple the fiscal 2020 U.S. budget deficit to a record $3.8 trillion, a staggering 18.7% of U.S. economic output, a Washington-based watchdog group said on Monday.  Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund said it would provide debt relief to 25 member countries under its Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to allow them to focus more financial resources on fighting the pandemic.  On the technical front, spot gold may test a resistance at $1,739 per ounce, a break above which could lead to a gain at $1,767, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.  Reflecting appetite for bullion, holdings in SPDR Gold Trust , the world\u2019s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), rose 1.6% to 1,009.70 tonnes on Monday, the highest since June 2013.  \u201cGold as a safe-haven has gained traction as currencies are being devalued by massive stimulus programs. This has also increased physical demand of gold (such as ETFs) to hedge against the debasement of fiat currencies,\u201d said Avtar Sandu, a senior commodities manager at Phillip Futures, in a note.  Palladium rose 1.9% to $2,231.61 per ounce. Silver gained 0.6% to $15.54 and platinum was up 2.5% at $766.70.","383":"(Reuters) - Trading volumes in interest rate futures have overtaken those in U.S. Treasuries for the first time and look on track for further growth.  FILE PHOTO: A man enters the CME Group offices in New York, United States, October 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The popularity of futures reflects an evolving market which is drawing in new participants many of whom prefer anonymous, open market trading venues like the CME Group\u2019s CME.O, which has a near-monopoly on rate futures.  It also demonstrates the impact of regulations that have constrained risk taking by banks, harming liquidity in some bonds, and made trading over-the-counter derivatives more expensive.  Volumes in futures have surged to $398 billion a day from $257 billion in 2010, while Treasury trading volumes have dwindled to $396 billion a day from $442 billion in the same timeframe.  Volatility in Treasuries that sent benchmark 10-year yields to four-year highs last month has helped boost activity.  \u201cCME rates product usage has increased from greater participation of buy-side clients and continuation of deep and consistent liquidity, in an environment when rates volatility has started to increase from very low levels,\u201d said Agha Mirza, CME\u2019s global head of interest rate products in Chicago.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch' three-month MOVE index .MERMOVE3M, which gauges volatility in Treasuries, jumped to 67 in February, the highest in 10 months.  New rules that require more capital to back over-the-counter derivatives are also being phased in, which is driving more investors to futures as an alternative.  \u201cInvestors are comparing to futures and seeing where the futures alternative is cheaper,\u201d said Kevin McPartland, head of research and market structure and technology at consultancy Greenwich Associates.  Greenwich estimates that trading in rate futures can be as much as 70 percent cheaper than doing the equivalent trade with a centrally-cleared interest rate swap. A Greenwich survey of dealers and derivatives users found U.S. respondents expected to move 11 percent of swaps trading to futures, while European participants planned to move 17 percent.  GREATER PARTICIPATION  Futures benefit from leverage and from not being held on bank balance sheets. Rate futures are also attracting firms seeking opportunity in fixed income as alternatives to equity strategies.  \u201cAs the principal trading world has moved away from equities trading due to a decrease in profit opportunities, fixed income has become a big growth area, particularly in futures markets for a host of reasons,\u201d said McPartland.  The number of firms with large open interest in interest rate futures at the CME rose to a record 2,086 in February, and is up from 1,649 a year earlier. Volumes in the CME\u2019s interest rate futures edged over 100 percent that of Treasuries on March 7, based on a 52-week moving average. That is up from 94 percent a year ago and 58 percent in 2010.  Rate futures account for 33 percent of the CME\u2019s trading and clearing revenues, according to its most recent annual report.  Moves to relax some regulations may reduce the relative advantages of futures, though they are not likely to reverse the trend.  The Federal Reserve is seen as close to easing some of the bank capital requirements. Market participants have blamed a rule known as the supplementary leverage ratio for reducing liquidity in non-benchmark Treasuries known as \u201coff-the-runs.\u201d  \u201cSome of the suggested changes on leverage would make trading-off-the-run Treasuries easier, which would reduce the relative attractiveness of futures,\u201d said Michael Cloherty, head of U.S. rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York.  The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), which represents the privately traded derivatives industry, has also said it may challenge the capital requirements for swaps because they are more onerous than for futures.  \u201cI think if you were able to get the charges down on swaps people would migrate to swaps because a lot of people prefer swaps to futures,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo in New York.  To the CME, new regulations compliment capital advantages that already favored the futures contracts.  \u201cAll of those became more amplified and one could argue that there has been greater usage of futures,\u201d Mirza said.","384":"* Company points to costs related to Brexit, MiFID II  * Sees additional costs of 10 mln pounds in 2018  * Sees 2018 EPS below analysts\u2019 expectations  * Board felt CEO had under-invested in business -source  * Shares sink to over 3-year low (Adds details, shares, Phizackerley, analyst and source comment)  By Noor Zainab Hussain  July 10 (Reuters) - The world\u2019s largest financial broker TP ICAP fired Chief Executive John Phizackerley on Tuesday and warned rising costs would see profit fall short of expectations this year, sending its shares crashing by more than a third.  TP ICAP warned underlying operating profit would be hurt by costs of about 10 million pounds ($13.2 million) related to Britain\u2019s EU exit and new rules on market transparency.  Earnings per share (EPS) would be below the bottom end of the range of analysts\u2019 expectations of 34.9 pence to 39 pence, the company added.  In Tuesday\u2019s trading update, the company also cut its cost savings target to 75 million pounds from 100 million pounds annually by the end of 2019, blaming investment needs to deal with changes in the industry.  Phizackerley is replaced by Nicolas Breteau, who currently leads TP ICAP\u2019s largest business - global broking.  Tullett Prebon\u2019s buyout of its main rival ICAP\u2019s voice broking business in 2015 reflected the growing strains on one of the City of London\u2019s trademark industries - the phone-toting brokers who acted as go-betweens for major banks and financial firms in currency, energy and interest rate markets.  Lower volatility on financial markets has hurt the firm as investors reined in risk-taking and stock markets racked up a decade of gains and the costs of Brexit and the European Union\u2019s MiFID II regulatory reform have compounded those problems.  \u201cThe evolving landscape is driving up costs across our industry. The acquisition of ICAP has given us greater scale to withstand this pressure,\u201d Chairman Rupert Robson said in a statement.  \u201cHowever, it has become clear that a change of leadership is required to execute our medium-term growth strategy and deliver the detail of the integration process.\u201d  DEFENDING HIS RECORD  One criticism against Phizackerley was that he focused solely on the integration of ICAP\u2019s voice broking business and was not able to juggle day to day operations, leading to poor results and creeping costs.  \u201cThe board did take a swift and decisive decision and he (Phizackerley) was told last night ... there was under investment in the business with expected headwinds like MiFID II and Brexit,\u201d a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  Phizackerley, who joined Lehman Brothers in 1986, had been in charge of first Tullett Prebon and later TP ICAP since 2014, defended his record.  \u201cWe created the world\u2019s biggest inter dealer TP ICAP. I\u2019m very proud of that,\u201d he told Reuters in a message on LinkedIn.  \u201cI\u2019m disappointed about the events of the last 24 hours. TP ICAP has a bright future. I wish my friends and colleagues the best of luck,\u201d he added.  Shares in TP ICAP were already down 20 percent this year as of Monday\u2019s close. Tuesday\u2019s fall to 265 pence in meant they have halved in value since mid-February.  While TP ICAP has struggled, the electronically-focussed remainder of the ICAP business founded by Conservative party grandee Michael Spencer - now named NEX Group - has flourished.  NEX reported a 9 percent rise in full-year core trading profit in May and U.S. exchange operator CME Group agreed to pay $5.5 billion for the company in a deal due to close later this year.

Spot gold was up 2.3% at $1,653.35 per ounce by 1:49 p.m. EDT (1749 GMT), having hit its highest level since March 11 at $1,655.69 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures settled 2.9% higher at $1,693.90. \"Physical demand continues to dominate and support gold prices. Massive amounts of stimulus are effectively diluting currencies so gold demand is coming from all directions,\" said Phil Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures in Chicago. The U.S. dollar stalled against most currencies but continued its rise versus the Japanese yen as the rate of deaths from coronavirus in Europe slowed while deaths in Japan and elsewhere in Asia accelerated. Japan is to impose a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures as early as Tuesday to contain the coronavirus, while the government prepares a $990 billion stimulus package to soften the economic blow. The pandemic has infected more than 1,250,000 people around the world, with over 68,400 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. The coronavirus is the European Union's biggest test, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday, adding that it was important that the bloc emerges strong from the economic crisis unleashed by the pandemic. Governments and central banks around the world have unleashed unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus and other support for economies floored by the coronavirus pandemic. \"We think the set-up for a multi-year bull market is being cemented as the market is awash with both monetary and fiscal stimulus while rates are at the zero bound,\" analysts at TD Securities said in a note. \"Which suggests investors will continue to seek gold's warm embrace as real global rates become entrenched in negative territory.\" Reflecting investor sentiment, holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust , rose 0.7% to 978.99 tonnes on Friday - the highest in more than three years.

FILE PHOTO: Men enter the CME Group offices in New York, U.S., October 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The Chicago Board of Trade-owner\u2019s net income was $503.3 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, down from $513.8 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, a year earlier.  The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred volatility in equity markets, benefiting some exchange operators, like Nasdaq Inc NDAQ.O, which last week reported better-than-expected earnings as stock and options trading volume soared.  But CME\u2019s volumes were mostly down, after the U.S. Federal Reserve flooded the markets with liquidity in response to the pandemic and said interest rates would stay near zero for the foreseeable future, reducing the demand for hedging through futures on rates, commodities and currencies.  While interest rates have experienced \u201cunprecedented low volatility\u201d across the yield curve in response to the Fed\u2019s actions, the longer-term outlook for interest rate futures is positive, said Sean Tully, a senior managing director at CME.  \u201cOnce the Federal Reserve reduces its intervention in the market and once the pandemic recedes, the needs for hedging, the needs for our products, are going to be much, much larger, I think, than ever before in history,\u201d he said on a call with analysts.  Clearing and transaction fees, CME\u2019s biggest revenue stream, fell 10.6% to $940.2 million from a year earlier as the company\u2019s average daily volume tumbled 15.8% to 17.6 million contracts.  Revenue from CME\u2019s market data and information services business rose 5% to $134.7 million.  Total revenue fell 7.1% from a year earlier to $1.18 billion.  Stripping out one-time items like acquisition costs, CME earned $1.63 per share, topping analysts expectations by a penny, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","392":"(Reuters) - CME Group\u2019s fourth-quarter profit trounced Wall Street estimates on Thursday, as a broad market sell-off toward the end of the quarter prompted investors to rebalance their portfolios and boosted trading volumes.  Fears of a U.S. slowdown and the U.S.-China trade war spiked market volatility in the quarter ended Dec. 31, which helped exchange operators such as CME and Cboe Global Markets Inc earn more from clearing and settling transactions.  The company, however, warned that trading volumes, across many asset classes, have already started slowing this year.  CME\u2019s average daily volume (ADV) surged 31 percent to 20.8 million contracts in the quarter, lifting clearing and transaction fees, its biggest revenue stream, 36 percent to $1.03 billion.  The company is now averaging 17 million contracts per day so far this year, it said, signaling the onset of a risk-off trading environment.  \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual to see a market pause following periods of elevated volatility,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy said on a conference call with analysts.  Macro economic issues such as Brexit, the trade negotiations and uncertainty over another potential government shutdown, have kept investors on the sidelines of trading in currencies, commodities, bonds and equities so far this year.  \u201cMarkets like clarity, and we\u2019re hopeful that some of these issues I just outlined will start to get resolved,\u201d Duffy said.  Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, two major U.S. banks, have also flagged a weak start to the year, when compared to last year on less market volatility.  CME\u2019s peers Cboe Global Markets Inc, Nasdaq Inc and Intercontinental Exchange Inc have reported stronger-than-expected profits, driven by strong trading volumes.  Exchange operators have been diversifying toward market data services, in a move to reduce dependence on transaction clearing and settling business, which is influenced by market volatility.  Revenue from CME\u2019s market data and information services business, which help investors to take trading decisions and minimize risks, rose 28 percent to $130 million in the quarter.  Last year\u2019s expenses of the Chicago-based company rose 28 percent to $1.70 billion. Excluding license fees, the company expects expenses to be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.66 billion this year.  The company's adjusted net income rose reut.rs\/2tm2oGk to $624.5 million, or $1.77 per share, in the quarter. Analysts had expected the company to report a profit of $1.72 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

REUTERS\/Tyrone Siu  HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Most chief executives like to think big and Charles Li has been no exception. The outgoing boss of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange built a link with mainland China that handles large trading volumes every day and tried and failed to buy his London rival for $39 billion. That legacy and a spate of recent deals across the industry might tempt his replacement. It would be better to resist any such urges and focus on shoring up the company\u2019s strengths.  In the decade under Li, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing solidified its position as a gateway to the People\u2019s Republic. With a $63 billion market value in mid-December, it was jockeying with CME to be the world\u2019s most valuable trading hub. Competition is rising for HKEX, however, as Shanghai and Shenzhen lure the sorts of startups that traditionally considered heading southward to sell their shares. The danger is that the next Tencent doesn\u2019t reach Victoria Harbour.  Sizeable acquisitions will be tough and financially ill-advised for HKEX, though. Even as Nasdaq branches into regulatory technology with its $2.8 billion deal for Verafin and the London Stock Exchange aims to wrap up its $27 billion takeover of data provider Refinitiv, the Hong Kong bourse could be stymied from any similar M&A efforts because of its board\u2019s close ties to Hong Kong\u2019s Beijing-backed government.  A new chief would do well to devote energy and capital to fixing the outdated HKEX technology while also expanding further beyond equities into bond trading and derivatives. A focus on improving creaky systems, including the one that registers shares, and tackling its relatively high trading costs would carry significant expense. Its rival-beating 74% pre-tax profit margin will be squandered, however, if competitors woo more issuers and investors.  HKEX cannot escape its geography or the politics that cloud Hong Kong\u2019s future. But those aspects are also what differentiate it from most of its peers. And the city\u2019s position as a financial hub is riding to a large degree on the exchange\u2019s success. The bold choice for the next CEO will be to resist the appeal of empire-building and instead doing what it does best, only better.  This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2021.

Co-founder and CFO Alexander Thoma of Swiss Blockchain-Asset Rating Company Alethena, co-founder and President Pascal Marco Caversaccio, co-founder and CEO Markus Hartmann, CSO Benjamin Rickenbacher and co-founder and COO Tim Glaus pose for a photograph in their office in Bern, Switzerland November 12, 2018. Ruben Sprich\/Handout via REUTERS  Self-proclaimed social media personalities charge thousands of dollars for video reviews. Research houses accept payments in the cryptocurrencies they are analyzing. Rating \u201cexperts\u201d will grade anything positively, for a price.  All this is common, according to more than two dozen people in the cryptocurrency market and documents reviewed by Reuters.  Earlier this year, Ukrainian start-up Hacken was looking to promote its new coin after raising $3 million online in late 2017. Chief Executive Dmytro Budorin and his team identified a list of almost 200 cryptocurrency social media personalities they thought could help them, he said.  Hacken paid $7,500 for Christopher Greene, host of Alternative Media Television - a YouTube channel with more than 500,000 subscribers - to review its coin in a video, Budorin told Reuters. In the 25-minute video, published on June 22, Greene raved about Hacken\u2019s coin and business, describing it as a \u201chuge market opportunity\u201d with \u201cpotential 1,000x returns.\u201d  Future of Money The latest news and innovation around fintech.  Nowhere in the video - which has more than 92,000 views - is Hacken\u2019s payment to Greene mentioned. Greene, who used to work for wealth management firm Merrill Lynch, directs viewers in the first minute of the video to a disclaimer on his website that states he \u201cmay receive compensation for products and services\u201d that he recommends. There is no specific mention of Hacken, or any specific cryptocurrency issuers, paying him.  Greene did not respond to emails and phone messages from Reuters asking about his work for Hacken.  Four days after the YouTube review was published, Greene turned to Twitter to brag that Hacken\u2019s coin was up 14 percent on the day to $1.54 per coin.  Some people paid attention. Carter Zurawel, a yoga instructor in Calgary, Canada, replied to Greene\u2019s tweet: \u201cThat Hacken video was great man! Made me buy a couple hundred.\u201d  The token\u2019s price has since fallen by more than 75 percent to 36 cents. Zurawel told Reuters in Twitter messages that he lost much of his initial investment, worth several hundred dollars. He said he was not aware that Greene was paid for his Hacken video, but he shrugged off the poor performance of the currency. \u201cI will probably hold onto it because I strongly believe that the cryptocurrency market will rally in the future,\u201d he told Reuters.  Budorin told Reuters he recognized that the company\u2019s payment to Greene and other YouTube reviewers were \u201cunethical.\u201d Video reviews \u201cshould be either done with (a) sponsored tag or only for projects that (the) reviewer personally supports,\u201d he said.  Hacken\u2019s approach exemplifies a pay-for-play hype machine that churns out recommendations viewed by hundreds of thousands of hungry investors. Few researchers or experts disclose their own holdings of the digital assets, which so far have existed in a regulatory gray area.  The crypto bubble peaked last December: bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is down more than 80 percent from its high just above $20,000. The total value of all virtual coins is now about $121 billion, down from about $830 billion at the start of the year.  That has not stopped the hype machine humming.  REGULATORY GRAY AREA  So-called \u201cinfluencer marketing\u201d is common on social media, where celebrities and others tout anything from shoes to cars. Also common in these plugs is a lack of disclosure, which may mean the buyer is unaware of a conflict of interest. When it comes to cryptocurrencies however, stricter rules may apply.  In July 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published a report on its investigation into digital currencies and warned participants in the market that \u201cvirtual coins or tokens may be securities and subject to the federal securities laws.\u201d  The SEC issued a more specific warning about promotion of online fundraisers known as initial coin offerings (ICOs) on Nov. 1 last year. \u201cAny celebrity or other individual who promotes a virtual token or coin that is a security must disclose the nature, scope, and amount of compensation received in exchange for the promotion,\u201d the SEC said in a public statement posted on its website.  Failure to do so is a violation of anti-touting provisions of federal securities laws, and may also be fraud, the SEC said.  The SEC has not issued determinations on which cryptocurrencies it regards as securities. But the agency has brought enforcement actions against a dozen or so companies connected to ICOs, some of which the agency has identified as unregistered securities offerings, and therefore subject to its regulation.  The SEC has not targeted outside promoters of currency offerings. Its warning in November of 2017 - near the height of the crypto frenzy - alone has led to a \u201cdramatic decline\u201d in celebrity endorsements of ICOs, the SEC\u2019s co-director of enforcement, Stephanie Avakian, said in September. The SEC declined comment to Reuters for this story.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Nevertheless, hundreds of self-styled cryptocurrency experts have emerged over the past 18 months, and their activity has declined only slightly. There are now more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies vying for attention, all promising riches to investors. The vacuum of hard facts on new currencies has left investors vulnerable to hype and bad advice.  \u201cThe main reason why so many inexperienced individuals invest in bad crypto projects is because they listen to advice from a so-called expert,\u201d said Larry Cermak, head of analysis at cryptocurrency research and news website The Block. Cermak said he does not own any cryptocurrencies and has never promoted any. \u201cThey believe they can take this advice at face value even though it is often fraudulent, intentionally misleading or conflicted.\u201d  Blockchain explained A Reuters visual guide to blockchain technology  \u2018EXPERT\u2019 REVIEWS  ICObench is one of the most popular websites listing and rating ICOs. Its pages are among the top hits in any Google search for a specific crypto project and the word ICO, making it a key site for currency operators to appear on.  Ratings on the roughly 15-month-old website are generated by unpaid \u201cexperts\u201d who passed the website\u2019s background check process, ICObench chief executive Maxim Sharatsky told Reuters.  As of Nov. 14, ICObench had 361 experts whose ratings are overseen by the site\u2019s 34 employees based in Moscow, London and across Asia, he said. ICObench had 1.7 million visits to its website between mid-October and mid-November, Sharatsky told Reuters.  The website itself makes money through advertising and a premium model which lets cryptocurrency companies pay between 1 and 40 bitcoin to be featured in newsletters, at the top of search results and elsewhere.  Seven ICObench experts told Reuters they have been approached by cryptocurrency companies or their public relations agents and offered money in exchange for a rating, although none said they accepted any such offers.  Tim Glaus, a co-founder of Alethena, a Swiss-based startup, told Reuters his firm was approached by multiple individuals who said they could arrange paid-for ratings from ICObench experts after Alethena listed its coin offering on ICObench. Markus Hartmann, another of Alethena\u2019s co-founders, wrote about the experience on the blog Medium in June, in what he said was an effort to expose \u201cde facto investor fraud.\u201d Alethena runs a cryptocurrency ratings platform that competes in some areas with ICObench.  Sharatsky told Reuters that ICObench does not sell ratings. When ICObench is informed that experts may have been paid for ratings, he said, it investigates and takes the reviews down if they are tainted.  \u201cWe have more than 16,000 ratings on our platform,\u201d Sharatsky said. \u201cUnfortunately, we have (had) accidents with sales (of) ratings, and it\u2019s very bad. It\u2019s a problem for me, for our platform and for all interested.\u201d  FIVE-STAR REVIEWS  Hartmann was contacted in late May on the encrypted Telegram messaging app from a user with the handle \u201cVagiz,\u201d who offered to get Alethena five-star ratings on ICObench for $500 each, taking a 10 percent cut, according to Telegram messages Alethena showed to Reuters.  He negotiated to pay $800 for two ICObench reviews and asked for the service to be delivered as quickly as possible, according to the messages. Less than 30 minutes later Vagiz messaged Hartmann on Telegram: \u201cDone. There are two 5* :)\u201d  Vagiz was referring to two five-star ratings from ICObench experts Daniil Morozov and Anatoly Bordyugov, according to Alethena. These were the only new five-star ratings that appeared after Vagiz messaged that he was done, leading Alethena to believe those were the reviews that had been arranged, Glaus said.  Alethena said it paid Vagiz 1.16 ether - another cryptocurrency - for the service, worth about the agreed price at the time. Alethena sent Reuters screenshots of the reviews which have been removed.  A few days later Hartmann paid Vagiz an additional 0.56 ether for a third rating from a reviewer named Jason Hung, according to the messages. \u201c1 rate is done. Hung is from me,\u201d Vagiz wrote, providing screenshots of Hung\u2019s ratings.  Morozov, the ICObench expert, told Reuters he did not take payment for the rating and did not know Vagiz. Bordyugov, the other ICObench expert, did not respond to requests for comment made through his website and sent on LinkedIn. Hung, whose rating still appears on ICObench, also told Reuters he did not take payment for the rating on Alethena and said he did not know Vagiz.  ICObench CEO Sharatsky told Reuters that after Hartmann wrote about his experiences on Medium, he and his staff investigated Alethena\u2019s claims against Morozov and Bordyugov and found that both reviewers did accept money for positive ratings. As a result, ICObench stripped Morozov and Bordyugov of their expert status and took all of their ratings off the site, Sharatsky said. He said the investigation found no proof that Hung\u2019s rating was paid for.  WALL STREET-STYLE RESEARCH  As cryptocurrencies move into the mainstream, some companies have started offering research in formats mimicking the style of traditional Wall Street firms.  Spero Research, based in Sydney, Australia, publishes reports on cryptocurrency projects which are \u201cvery impartial\u201d and \u201cvery independent,\u201d according to Henry Sit, one of Spero\u2019s co-founders. He compares the reviews to those written by traditional stock analysts.  Nevertheless, the research is commissioned and paid for directly by the projects that are being reviewed, Sit told Reuters. The company accepts payments in ether but will also accept half of the total fee in the project\u2019s currency, depending on \u201chow good the project (is) and how much we like it personally,\u201d Sit said. \u201cThere is definitely a conflict there,\u201d he acknowledged. He added that Spero would not change its opinion just because the cryptocurrency project that has been reviewed disagrees with Spero\u2019s conclusions.  Spero\u2019s reports do have general disclosures. But they are not specific about whether a payment was made by the client whose project is being assessed, and if so, how much.  \u201cSpero may be paid to publish research reports - depending on the circumstances, this may be from clients of Spero on the buy-side, or from providers of assets and currencies on the sell-side,\u201d said the disclosure on a cryptocurrency report published in August. \u201cSpero members may hold cryptocurrency that are the subject of research and publication.\u201d  Sit would not say which of Spero\u2019s reports had been financed by their subjects.  Some investors cry foul at such quid-pro-quo research. \u201cPaid reviews should not only be disclosed, they should be outlawed,\u201d said Ric Edelman, head of the wealth management firm Edelman Financial Services and an investor in bitcoin and ether. \u201cUntil they\u2019re outlawed, the disclosure should be as prominent as the headline.\u201d  PROFESSIONAL COPYWRITERS  An array of \u201cICO agencies\u201d has sprung up, as well. These promoters offer crypto issuers active followers and posts on social media platforms such as Telegram, Reddit and Bitcointalk. Online chatter can attract investors, given the lack of conventional financial information available on cryptocurrencies.  Reuters contacted one such agency, TGE.company, to inquire about the services advertised on its website. An email received in response to the inquiry directed Reuters to a Telegram messaging account under the name of \u201cPapa Karlo.\u201d That user sent a Reuters a price list which said the agency could arrange to provide 630 comments in a Telegram group at a rate of 45 comments a day for $800, payable in the digital currency tether. Reuters was not able to confirm the identity of Papa Karlo. The services he offered were in line with a price list on the firm\u2019s website, under the words: \u201cWe create hype through complex solutions which increase community activity.\u201d  \u201cAll messages will be relevant to the project and written by professional copywriters with extensive experience in ICO,\u201d according to the price list Papa Karlo shared with Reuters. The list offered comments from \u201cdozens of high-level\u201d accounts on Bitcointalk, as well as posts on Reddit, at prices ranging from $950 to $2,900.  Reddit told Reuters its policies prohibit users from engaging in manipulation or creating multiple accounts to avoid restrictions, and any users detected breaking those policies are \u201cactioned appropriately.\u201d Telegram and Bitcointalk did not respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment.  Richard Foster, the UK-based co-founder of cryptocurrency startup Security Token Network, said that in September he paid an individual $50 on the freelancer network Fiverr to help grow his company\u2019s Telegram followership. The seller, going by the handle \u201cheroic_anthony,\u201d assured Foster that the users would not be fake, according to messages seen by Reuters.  \u201cAnd then within one minute there were like 1,000 people added,\u201d Foster told Reuters. \u201cI went mad.\u201d  Foster said he complained to Fiverr and had the freelancer delete all the fake followers. Fiverr refunded Foster\u2019s money and told him it would investigate the user, according to an email seen by Reuters.  \u201cThe circumstances you\u2019ve described violate our terms of service,\u201d Sam Katzen, a spokesman for Fiverr, told Reuters. \u201cWhen violations are reported, we take swift action to investigate and handle the situation appropriately.\u201d Katzen declined to disclose whether \u201cheroic_anthony\u201d had been banned from the site, or what exact terms of service had been violated. Fiverr\u2019s terms of service, posted on its website, forbid the sale of \u201cillegal or fraudulent services.\u201d  PAY FOR ARTICLES  Another service on offer from ICO agencies is paying writers to publish stories mentioning their clients, or linking back to their clients\u2019 websites, according to interviews with four agencies and six email offers seen by Reuters. Prices range from as little as $100 to as much $10,000, according to interviews and messages.  A cryptocurrency data company showed Reuters an email it had received from an individual offering an article on business website Forbes.com for $2,500. The post, which would feature a company\u2019s name and website, could be delivered in six to eight weeks, the email promised. The email included a coupon for a $500 discount.  Forbes.com said in a written statement to Reuters that its editorial guidelines explicitly forbid contributors from receiving payments in exchange for stories. Forbes did not share its editorial guidelines with Reuters.  Earlier this month, Forbes removed a post under the byline of Harold Stark, originally published late last year, which referenced a cryptocurrency issuer, after Reuters inquired about it. In a statement to Reuters this month, Forbes said it had discovered in early 2018 that Stark violated its editorial guidelines. It is not clear if Stark accepted payments for his Forbes post. Stark did not respond to a request for comment on LinkedIn.  \u201cWe terminated our relationship with him and removed all of his content from our site at that time,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDue to a technical glitch, his prior content reappeared, but we have removed the content once again.\u201d","404":"* May copper volumes slide 40% on CME, 26% on LME  * Funds slash risk profiles, pull back from new positions  * Shanghai copper activity robust, surges 21% in May  LONDON, June 12 (Reuters) - Copper trading on the CME and London Metal Exchange tumbled last month as funds and speculators fled from high volatility during the coronavirus pandemic, but volumes shot up in top metals consumer China as lockdowns were lifted.  Dealing activity in copper - the metal widely regarded as an economic barometer of the global economy due to its industrial uses - has withered in the West and analysts expect it to remain weak after sharp swings on the market.  The CME Group, favoured by funds and other speculators, was hardest hit, with trading volumes in Comex copper futures and options plummeting 40% to 1.26 million contracts in May compared to last year.  The larger London Metal Exchange, the main venue for physical business from miners and industrial users, saw volumes slide 26% to 2.12 million lots last month, according to data from the exchanges.  \u201cMany people were hurt on the downside and hurt on the upside as well,\u201d said Gabriel Garcin, portfolio specialist of alternative and traditional investments at UBS in Paris.  \u201cNow you end up today with less leveraged market participants who are not really willing to take huge amounts of new directional risk on these markets.\u201d  Open interest - measuring the flow of money that remains in a contract - in CME\u2019s Comex copper futures stands at the lowest levels since 2016.  Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at commodities broker Marex Spectron, said there had been derisking across quantitative strategies.  Banks, mainly in the West, have formulated \u201crisk premia\u201d products for institutional investors that seek to boost returns using alternative assets such as commodities.  Speculators piled in with bearish positions as COVID-19 lockdowns cut demand for metals, pushing benchmark copper prices on the LME to a 45-month low of $4,371 a tonne on March 19.  Prices have since rebounded by about a third to around $5,800, but volumes and open interest have remained subdued.  Volumes were high in March across metals exchanges, surging 31.6% on Comex and 18% on the LME, reflecting increased bearish bets and withdrawal of participants.  In China, however, copper volumes have been robust, surging 21% on the Shanghai Futures Exchange in May after a 38% jump in April.  That reflects the fact that ShFE attracts a lot of small retail speculators, which have persisted in their trades, as well as increasing numbers of industrial players.  \u201cHedging activity for example is not as common yet in China so there is more room for growth of new participants,\u201d an Asia-based trader said, adding that bargain hunters were also out in force in April.  The LME is owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd.","405":"LONDON (Reuters) - Stock and derivatives exchanges will remain open despite extraordinary volatility in global financial markets, the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) said on Thursday.  \u201cEven as our present crisis causes large swings in markets and operational pressure on market infrastructures, these functions remain critically important,\u201d the WFE said in a statement.  \u201cIt is important that markets remain open and that the hours of trading remain as normal, to preserve the benefits of price formation and access to liquidity for society.\u201d  The WFE represents exchanges and clearing houses from across the world, including CME, Nasdaq, Shanghai Stock Exchange, Japan Exchange and Deutsche Boerse.","406":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - CME Group CME.O, parent of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), has ordered The Andersons Inc ANDE.O, an Ohio-based grain business, to pay a $2 million fine for violating futures trading rules in late 2017, the exchange said in a statement on Friday.  The Andersons confirmed the settlement in a statement to Reuters and said it cooperated with the CME\u2019s investigation.  \u201cWe do not believe we engaged in any wrongdoing,\u201d it said in the statement.  The 6th-largest U.S. commercial grain handler by capacity operates several Ohio grain warehouses that also serve as delivery points for CBOT wheat futures.  According to CME, The Andersons registered 2,000 contracts of wheat certificates for delivery against CBOT December 2017 wheat futures on Nov. 29, 2017 - a day before the first notice day for deliveries \u2013 in an effort to manipulate the spread, or price difference, between futures contracts.  At the time, the wheat registrations surprised traders, and CBOT December futures fell sharply the next day, widening the price spread between the December and back-month contracts. The exchange said The Andersons placed bids in futures spreads in anticipation of the market impact of its delivery registrations.  A large number of CBOT delivery registrations can signal that end-users such as flour mills are amply supplied and that there is plenty of wheat to go around. That information, in turn, can depress futures prices.  \u201cThe Andersons registered the certificates with the belief that the wheat spread would widen and trade into its resting bids. The Andersons then re-purchased certificates at reduced prices,\u201d the CME Group statement said. In the month leading up to the first notice day, the Andersons sold wheat to flour mills in the Toledo, Ohio, area in order to limit demand for the grain, the CME statement said. Such a move could further support the perception of weak cash-market demand, one trader said.","407":"March 20 (Reuters) -  * RONIN CAPITAL UNABLE TO MEET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AT CME - CNBC, CITING SOURCES Source: cnb.cx\/2WD2fy2 Further company coverage:","408":"FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs GS.N will offer clearing facilities for some currency derivative products on the London-based clearing house LCH's ForexClear service, the bank said on Thursday.  Clearing or settling trades via exchanges or clearing houses is well established in equities and other asset classes. But lots of trades in financial products - particularly in the forex market - are still done \u201cover-the-counter\u201d, where there is no central clearing house backing up the deals.  Clearing ensures financial market trades are completed even if one side of the transaction goes wrong.  Centralised clearing is starting to increase in the $6.6 trillion a day foreign exchange market, but this is largely limited to currency futures which make up only a tiny fraction of the total market.  New regulations are gradually making it more expensive for investment banks to trade derivatives and this is encouraging them to send some trades for clearing to exchanges like the CME Group CME.O and the London Stock Exchange LSE.L and its clearing division LCH.  LCH\u2019s ForexClear provides clearing services for currency non-deliverable forwards as well as for the currency options spot and forwards market.  Non-deliverable currency forwards are products where participants take a bet on a currency but settle in a different currency, mostly the U.S. dollar. This has gradually shifted from a bilateral trading model to a more centralised trading structure.  NDFs are the only type of FX derivative which are showing the biggest growth rate in clearing, which has led to a greater concentration of trading in these instruments in the main currency hubs globally, including New York, London, Singapore and Hong Kong.  London dominates market share in NDF trading, with Britain more than doubling its share to 46% in 2019 from 20% in 2016, data from the Bank of International Settlements showed.","409":"(Reuters) - The CME will launch next week futures based on a new benchmark rate published by the Federal Reserve, but investors may be slow to embrace them after unexpected volatility and a calculation error led to a rocky start for the new rate.  The CME Group\u2019s CME.O launch of the contracts tracking the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, is part of a multi-year effort to move around $200 trillion in U.S.-dollar based derivatives and loans away from the use of the London interbank offered rate (Libor) as a benchmark. Cleared interest rate swaps based on the rate are also slated for this year.  Regulators including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell have warned that Libor could pose systemic risks in the event it stops being published due to the sheer size of markets based on the rate.  Still investors are also not yet comfortable with SOFR, which the New York Federal Reserve only began publishing on April 3.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like there is a great reason to get involved whole hog right away with these futures,\u201d said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York.  Libor is fragile as a decline in loans between banks means that borrowing rates are often estimated and not transaction-based. The benchmark also lost credibility after revelations that banks manipulated Libor submissions, in many cases to boost profits on their derivatives positions.  Analysts have expected SOFR to be more volatile than Libor as it is based on the overnight repurchase agreement market, which can have relatively large fluctuations that include declines in the middle of the month, and spikes at month-end that are exaggerated at quarter- and year-end.  Still, the rate has remained more elevated than many expected despite the Treasury\u2019s repayment of Treasury bills as it received tax payments in April.(New reference rate has a choppy start: reut.rs\/2rkqxMX)  \u201cThere is still a lot of volatility in the rate that I think is surprising on a daily basis. I think people don\u2019t really feel like they totally understand it yet,\u201d said Simons.  The New York Fed said on April 16 that forward-settling overnight repo transactions were inadvertently included in data that was provided to the bank to calculate the rate, though that problem has since been rectified.  Futures based on SOFR are expected to help develop a term market on the rate, which does not yet exist as the majority of repo transactions are overnight.  Term rates will offer a view on where the rate is likely to trade at fixed points in the future.  They are also crucial for increasing investor interest in the rate. Most loans and interest rate swaps are based on term rates such as three months.  \u201cYou want the market to start forming an opinion of what it will look like in six months or twelve months,\u201d said Aaron Kohli, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.  However, \u201cit\u2019s very difficult for people to get a good idea of what this is going to look like in a few months when you really don\u2019t have a good idea of what it\u2019s even going to look like in a few weeks,\u201d Kohli said.  While SOFR, unlike Libor, is based on a robust and liquid market, it remains to be seen whether asset managers will be reluctant to adopt the rate due to the absence of the credit component that Libor offers.  For SOFR to succeed \u201cwhat we really need is some conviction in the marketplace that this is something that is really going to persist for a long term and that it\u2019s a somewhat efficient way of expressing a view of what the forward rate is going to reset at,\u201d Kohli said.","410":"MELBOURNE, April 12 (Reuters) - London zinc fell to a four-month low on Thursday, tracking the prices of other steel materials as demand from construction got off to a slow start in the usually strong second quarter.

With just over two months before Brexit day on March 29, Aquis and rivals Cboe and Turquoise are racing to get approval for EU hubs that would help them cope in the event of a disorderly departure.  Britain has yet to agree withdrawal terms with the EU, which are vital for cross-border trading to continue uninterrupted.

The move in euro share trading also mirrors the fixed income market where CME\u2019s BrokerTec is moving all trading in euro-denominated bonds from London to Amsterdam to avoid splitting up liquidity.

FILE PHOTO: Men enter the CME Group offices in New York, U.S., October 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  CME said the contract will take delivery at Cheniere Energy Inc\u2019s Sabine Pass LNG export terminal in Louisiana. It could not say when it will launch the new product or provide details other than that it will trade on the CME\u2019s New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) like its Henry Hub natural gas futures.  Overall world LNG consumption has risen to a record 39.0 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2017 from just 29.1 bcfd in 2010 and is expected to keep growing by about 3 percent a year through 2050, according to U.S. energy data.  While LNG trade on exchanges like the CME is still small, experts believe volumes will increase rapidly in the near future as the United States becomes one of the world\u2019s biggest LNG exporters.  Total U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to rise to 10.1 bcfd of gas in 2020 from 3.8 bcfd now, making the country the third-biggest LNG exporter in the world by capacity in 2019. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day.  \u201cWe have spoken to the market and they have expressed a desire to have a physically delivered LNG contract that can help them manage price risks,\u201d said Peter Keavey, global head of energy at CME.  Pricing at Cheniere\u2019s Sabine Pass is currently linked to the Henry Hub gas benchmark traded on CME\u2019s NYMEX. Sabine Pass was the first terminal in the U.S. lower 48 states to produce and deliver super-cooled LNG for export to the world.  Cheniere is the biggest buyer of gas in the United States, consuming over 3.1 bcfd, and is expected to increase purchases as more liquefaction trains at Sabine Pass and its Corpus Christi LNG export terminal enter service. The company\u2019s current consumption represents almost 4 percent of total projected U.S. gas production of 81.3 bcfd in 2018.  \u201cWith Cheniere behind the CME futures contract...the odds would favor the CME contract especially if Cheniere immediately starts to sell its LNG on a Sabine Pass contract basis,\u201d said Dominick Chirichella, director risk management, trading and advisory services at EMI DTN in New York.  The LNG market is in transition with a shift from long-term towards shorter-term contracts.

The London Metal Exchange\u2019s (LME) copper contract saw activity fall by 8% last year. The declines were more pronounced on both the CME and Shanghai Futures Exchanges (ShFE) contracts with volumes slumping by 25% and 29% respectively.  Only nickel bucked the broader trend thanks to heightened price volatility and the metal\u2019s electric vehicle credentials. Trading volumes rose by 3% in London and by 40% in Shanghai, where nickel has also assumed the role of junior partner in a proxy trade with the much larger iron ore market.  Exchanges can\u2019t do much about manufacturing slowdown or the resulting range-bound pricing but they are expanding their product range and opening up entirely new markets.  BASE METALS DOWNTURN  It was a year to forget for many of the base metals with copper, aluminium, zinc and lead closing out 2019 little changed from year-start levels.  Total volumes on the London market, which still dominates physical pricing, fell by 4.6% last year after a similar-sized rise in 2018.  In truth the LME fared slightly better than suggested by the headline figure, which includes so-called \u201cUNA\u201d trades introduced to comply with European MiFIDII regulations. Strip those out and the year-on-year decline was only 1.9%.  Even so, activity on all the LME\u2019s core contracts fell last year with the exception of nickel, the top price performer among the base metals in 2019, and tin, the weakest price performer. The same two metals were the only two to register higher volumes in Shanghai.  Tin remains a tiny futures market by comparison with nickel but even it dwarfs the LME\u2019s aluminium alloy contract, which with volume growth of 7% was the unlikely star performer last year.  That outperformance, however, should be seen in the context of falling activity in each of the previous four years.  NEW PRODUCTS  The LME launched two new aluminium premium contracts in March last year but with only limited success. The North American contract traded just 939 lots while the European product failed to trade at all.  CME, which launched the first of its four aluminium premium contracts as far back as 2013, appears to have captured this particular part of the market with total volumes last year of 152,353 contracts.  Its underlying aluminium contract looked in danger of disappearing altogether with no trades at all in 2018 but the contract sprang into life in the second half of 2019 after CME extended physical delivery to Asian locations such as Singapore and the Malaysian ports of Johor and Port Klang. They currently account for 9,291 tonnes of CME\u2019s total 17,145 tonnes of registered aluminium stocks.  CME zinc stocks have shrunk to just 6 tonnes and the contract, which didn\u2019t trade in the second half of the year, looks perilously close to following the CME lead contract into oblivion.  Volumes in the CME\u2019s copper options contract doubled year-on-year and the exchange\u2019s weekly options contracts, launched in 2018, steadily gained traction over the course of 2019.  As did the ShFE copper options contract, also launched in 2018. Almost 8.4 million lots traded in 2019 with open interest in December standing at 64,526 lots, up 16% on December 2018.  More new base metal products were launched last year by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx), the owner of the LME.  A suite of dollar-denominated \u201cmini\u201d contracts appear to be succeeding where the yuan-denominated offering has largely failed. Total volume was 29,334 contracts since launch in August, compared with just 237 over the whole year for the Chinese currency products.  THE NEW STEEL FRONTIER  All three exchanges are also making steady inroads into the ferrous sector, which has historically proved stubbornly resistant to futures trading.  The LME\u2019s scrap and rebar contracts have traded since the start of 2018 and are seeing respectable activity. Two new contracts, covering hot rolled coil (HRC) in China and North America, have seen volumes build since trading started in March last year. The former set a new monthly volume record of 16,297 lots in December, bringing the 2019 total to 45,884 lots.  The exchange has dropped plenty of hints it will consider building out its ferrous portfolio further, given the level of participation in the current offerings.  It\u2019s noticeable that the CME\u2019s HRC contract has seen increased action since the LME re-entered the steel sector after the failure of its former billet contract. CME volumes grew by 89% in 2018 and by another 45% last year, when the equivalent of almost 3.5 million tonnes traded.  ShFE currently runs the highest-volume global steel contract. Steel rebar volumes dropped 12% last year but still total led 930 million contracts. Even allowing for the fact that ShFE double-counts its volumes, a practice that changed at the start of 2020, it\u2019s still a staggering figure.  The Chinese exchange last year extended its ferrous product range with a new stainless contract, which traded 1.2 million lots in the first four months.  QIANHAI SURPRISE  Not all new products flourish and the LME\u2019s new cobalt and molybdenum contracts failed to get any traction last year.  The lack of interest in the new cash-settled cobalt contract is puzzling, given the steady decline in activity in the older physically deliverable contract, which saw volumes slump by 26% last year. It\u2019s not as if cobalt hasn\u2019t been volatile or that carmakers haven\u2019t expressed support for a way of hedging a key input into electric batteries.  Also strange is the lack of traction gained by either the CME or LME alumina contracts, given the sector has switched towards spot pricing.  CME alumina volumes fell by 79% last year to 118,200 tonnes, while the LME\u2019s new alumina contract notched up trades of just 46,000 tonnes.  Both were eclipsed by the 374,011 tonnes traded on the Qianhai Mercantile Exchange, HKEx\u2019s foray into mainland China.  The QME is something of an anomaly in the global metals exchange world. Barred from offering futures products in mainland China, HKEx has been building out a physical exchange.  Alumina was one of five metallic offerings launched last year. The others are copper cathode, copper rod, aluminium ingot and aluminium billet.  It\u2019s taken several years for HKEx to get the QME up and running but it is worth watching because it represents a clear challenge to the Chinese incumbent in Shanghai.  The big three exchanges currently co-exist in a relatively peaceful order. What the Chinese like to call a \u201cwin-win\u201d scenario may not last long if QME picks up trading momentum.","416":"LONDON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Turnover on some of the world\u2019s biggest currency-trading venues has dropped as falling market volatility prompts some global banks to route more volumes onto their internal platforms, the Bank for International Settlements said in a quarterly report.  Electronic trading between banks on the world\u2019s biggest platforms -- owned by Refinitiv, partly owned by Thomson Reuters and EBS, part of the CME Group, among others -- has fallen by 7% to $368 billion per day in 2019 from a similar survey three years ago.  This decline in trading has been driven by the growing trend of \u201cinternationalisation\u201d, where dealers temporarily warehouse risk arising from client trades on their books until it is offset against opposing client flow, reducing the need to use the broader market platforms.  The BIS, known as the central bankers\u2019 bank, noted these electronic inter-dealer brokerage systems, which are central to FX trading, now constitute only for a small portion of the turnover in the market even though they remain essential in price discovery.  BIS data showed banks reporting in the United Kingdom and the United States registered some of the largest declines in electronic trading on anonymous inter-dealer venues and also posted some of the highest internalisation ratios for cash trading.  London and New York hold the first and second spots in market share in global FX trading.  This trend has also been helped by a drop in currency market volatility to record lows. For example, trading ranges in the euro\/dollar last week, the world\u2019s most actively traded currency pair, was the narrowest in two decades.  The ability of the top banks to internalize client flows has also been helped by their ability to attract trading flows from customers via direct price streams and a pickup in automated trading. For example, Algorithmic trading on EBS, a major platform, has topped 75% in 2019 compared with nearly zero in 2004.  This trend of banks keeping a greater share of their trading flow on their internal systems has fuelled concentration of market share among a few very large banks, the BIS said.  \u201cThe falling share of inter-dealer trading has gone hand-in-hand with a handful of banks coming to dominate FX volumes,\u201d the BIS said.","417":"SAN FRANCISCO, May 7 (Reuters) - Bitcoin\u2019s drop in value from its December 2017 peak of $19,511 was tied directly to the listing of futures contracts tied to the cryptocurrency\u2019s value, new research published by the San Francisco Federal Reserve showed Monday.  \u201cThe rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence,\u201d four researchers wrote in the latest edition of the regional Fed bank\u2019s Economic Letter.  Fed policymakers have been dismissive, particularly in recent months, of bitcoin\u2019s promise as an alternative currency to the dollar or other central bank-backed money. San Francisco Fed President John Williams, who will next month move to New York to run the Fed there, has been particularly critical.  \u201cOne of the problems they have is the values are extremely volatile,\u201d Williams said in April of cryptocurrencies in general and bitcoin in particular.  Trading in futures, which sometimes reduces volatility in the underlying asset, appeared this time to aid bitcoin\u2019s fall.  The introduction of the contracts on CME, one week after a much thinner trade on began rival Chicago Board Options Exchange, gave bitcoin pessimists an easy way to bet on a drop in value. This is known as short-selling in the stock market but is an integral and unremarkable aspect of futures markets.  As trade in downside bets picked up on CME, the authors of the Fed paper wrote, that created a broader downcycle that affected the underlying \u201cspot\u201d bitcoin market as well, reducing order flow and putting downward pressure on the price.  \u201cWith falling prices, pessimists started to make money on their bets, fueling further short selling and further downward pressure on prices,\u201d they wrote.

FILE PHOTO: The offices where the London Metal Exchange is headquartered are seen in the City of London, Britain, January 18, 2018 REUTERS\/Peter Nicholls\/File Photo  The world\u2019s oldest and largest market for industrial metals wants a stronger portfolio of products as competition intensifies with rival exchanges, such as CME Group Inc. of the United States.  Trading was thin in the new contracts on Monday, but industry participants said it often took time for activity to gear up. By early afternoon in London, the only trades among the new contracts had been 40 lots of aluminum premiums.  \u201cIt\u2019s normal, most steel contract launches go slow,\u201d said Jeff Kabel, chairman emeritus at the International Steel Trade Association (ISTA). \u201cThere could be some trades today, but I\u2019d give it till mid-week or so.\u201d  The steel and alumina contracts have the best chance of succeeding, according to analysts, traders and other industry sources.  The 142-year-old LME has lost market share in recent years to the CME and China\u2019s Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE).  The LME has been slower than its rivals to launch new products, but it has recently developed new technology that makes launching new contracts easier, faster and less expensive.  The exchange hopes to boost volumes to make up for weaker revenues last year resulting from fee cuts as it rowed back after heavy criticism about a previous jump in fees.  Volumes at the LME rose 5 percent last year, but core profit fell by 10 percent in the commodities segment of its parent, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd.  MASSIVE STEEL SECTOR  The LME has high hopes for its new HRC contracts, believing it can tap into a massive global steel sector that has seen surging volumes develop in Chinese ferrous contracts.  HRC is steel that is heat processed into metal sheets used for car bodies and household appliances.  The LME is launching regional HRC contracts initially covering North America and China, and later adding northern Europe.  They will compete with the CME\u2019s Nymex exchange for U.S. metal and on ShFE for Chinese material.  The LME already has steel rebar and scrap contracts.  The LME also plans to launch a contract for alumina, the raw material to make aluminum, which has seen sharp price swings recently.  The alumina price twice spiked and tumbled last year, opening up a market for both consumers and producers to hedge the price.  The LME already has a physically-settled contract in cobalt, a metal key for electric vehicle batteries, but it hopes to gain more traction with its new cash-settled product <.  The other new products are minor metal molybdenum plus two regional aluminum premium contracts for U.S. Midwest and Europe.","420":"MILAN\/LONDON (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange LSE.L will move its European government bond trading from London to Italy before Britain's exit from the European Union next March, it said on Monday.  Signage is seen outside the entrance of the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain. Aug 23, 2018. REUTERS\/Peter Nicholls  The LSE\u2019s electronic government bond trading platform, known as MTS Cash, trades a daily average of 13.4 billion euros ($15.31 billion) of bonds. About 20 percent of this will shift to Milan, while trading in British government bonds will remain in London.  London is a major center for trading and clearing euro denominated securities, but the EU and the European Central Bank want to move it to the euro zone where they can regulate it directly, given that Britain will not be an EU member state from March.  A shift would also allow cross-border trading to continue if Britain were to crash out of the bloc without deal. MTS Cash became part of the LSE group when the exchange bought Borsa Italiana.  A source close to the matter said the move would be effective from March 1, 2019. The source also said MTS chief executive Fabrizio Testa recently wrote to clients to reassure them that the move and Brexit would not affect the functioning of markets.  A second source said new regulations were being currently discussed with debt management offices of the countries whose bonds are affected by the move.  The switch by MTS, first reported by the Financial Times, mirrors a similar move by rival BrokerTec, which accounts for a large chunk of trading in government bonds from the rest of Europe.  BrokerTec, part of CME CME.O, is moving trading in euro-denominated repos and government bonds from London to a new hub in Amsterdam by February to avoid splitting liquidity.  The LSE has already faced Brexit pressure on another front as customers of its clearing unit LCH in London shift some of their euro denominated repo transactions to an LCH subsidiary in Paris.  Deutsche Boerse\u2019s Eurex Clearing is offering a profit-sharing deal for banks that clear BrokerTec bond and repo trades in Frankfurt.  Eurex says it is already clearing interest rate derivatives worth an average 64 billion euros in October or 6 percent of a market that is still dominated by LCH from London.  The LSE has said its LCH unit in Paris has no plans to apply for a license to clear interest rate swaps, a sign of its confidence that the bulk of euro IRS clearing will stay in London for the foreseeable future.  Twenty-five banks in London are applying to the ECB for licenses to open hubs in Frankfurt, and will have to move staff and activities there.","421":"Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures volume and implied volatility on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) hit all-time highs on Wednesday after the front-month contract soared more than 36 percent over the past four days on colder weather forecasts.  CME Group Inc, which owns the NYMEX, said total futures volume rose to a preliminary record high of 1,602,673 contracts on Wednesday, topping the previous high set on Tuesday of 1,232,635.  Tuesday\u2019s high surpassed the previous record of 1,022,858 contracts set on Jan. 12, the CME said.  Traders said the combination of colder forecasts and the low amount of gas in storage going into the winter heating season brought a return of volatility that resembled the gas market of old.  Implied volatility, a determinant of an option\u2019s premium, rose to a record high of 98.6 percent, according to Reuters data going back to 2007.  The increases in volume and volatility came after the front-month contract jumped to its highest since 2014 on Wednesday on forecasts for much colder weather than previously expected in November.  The cold forecast convinced many in the market that the record amount of gas coming out of the ground would not be enough to shrink a vast 16 percent storage deficit in November as previously projected. The amount of gas in storage at the end of October was the lowest since 2005.  Implied volatility has been on the rise since September after holding at very low levels between March and August. Implied volatility fell to a record low 19.2 percent in late July.  Since September, gas futures have traded up or down more than 3 percent eight times, compared with just one time from March to August and 13 times in January and February.  Implied volatility has averaged 36.4 percent since it started rising in September, up from just 26.0 during the first eight months of the year. That compares with an average of 37.0 in 2017, 38.9 during the prior five-years (2013-2017) and 49.4 in the previous five years (2008-2012).  That increased volatility boosted interest in NYMEX futures. CME said open interest in its Henry Hub gas benchmark has hit at least 10 open interest records since August, reaching an all-time high of 1,699,571 contracts on Oct. 4.","422":"LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange said it has no plans to suspend trading that has become volatile as investors dump shares in response to the coronavirus epidemic.  \u201cLondon Stock Exchange continues to operate as normal and there are no plans to suspend trading on our market,\u201d a spokeswoman for the exchange said in a statement.  \u201cIt is important that markets remain open to support companies who will continue to need access to capital and to ensure pricing is conducted in a fair and transparent manner for retail and institutional investors who need ongoing access to liquidity.\u201d (Reporting by Huw Jones, editing by Louise Heavens)","423":"LONDON (Reuters) - European Union preparations for a no-deal Brexit would split stock markets in Europe, although the damage could be reduced if Britain spelled out in advance its approach to trading, a top EU regulator said on Tuesday.

London is the centre for share trading in Europe, even for many non-UK shares, leaving EU asset managers facing a split pool of liquidity and less competitive prices.  After a spat with Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) last week partly reversed its \u201cshare trading obligation\u201d (STO) so that EU investors could still trade the 14 shares in London.  \u201cDespite this adjustment ... the STO will fragment markets and, being a supporter of open markets, I regret that result very much,\u201d ESMA Chair Steven Maijoor told a Federation of European Exchanges conference in Dublin.  The STO, however, is due to Britain deciding to leave the bloc and the risk of a no-deal Brexit, Maijoor said.  Britain has said that it will not disclose its approach to securities trading until it is clear there is no deal.  CLARITY NEEDED  Britain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31 and with no deal in sight Maijoor sought to pile pressure on the FCA to change tack so that there would not be clashing requirements.  \u201cPractically, this may mean that clarity will only be provided a few days, or perhaps even a few hours, ahead of a no-deal situation,\u201d Maijoor said.  \u201cTo allow market participants to properly prepare for the risk of a no-deal, I sincerely hope that this timing is reconsidered, and that clarity is provided well-ahead of the October Brexit date.\u201d  Separately on Tuesday, market participants criticised what they saw as a push by the EU to build up its own capital market now that the region\u2019s largest, London, will be outside the bloc.  Bruce Savage, Deutsche Bank\u2019s head of regulatory affairs for listed derivatives, told a conference that STO was \u201cclearly being used as a tool to move liquidity from London\u201d.

(ESMA graphic - tmsnrt.rs\/2OzQMwN)  They include allowing EU regulators to directly supervise clearing houses on their home turf in some instances.  For two regulators to air their differences so publicly is rare.  Asked if the bloc would weaken the rules, EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said they were similar to how the United States supervises foreign financial firms that serve U.S. customers.  \u201cOur system would become more similar to the U.S. system. It\u2019s a balanced approach,\u201d Dombrovskis said.  The EU was not calling into question its existing agreement with the United States on recognising each other\u2019s derivatives clearing rules, he said.  Dombrovskis\u2019 top civil servant, Olivier Guersent, told the Politico event that it was unfortunate that \u201cmy friend Mr Giancarlo is blackmailing legislators\u201d.  When the United States threatened to cut off U.S. market access for EU financial firms, it would change nothing. \u201cI don\u2019t like it but that is their right,\u201d Guersent said.  The EU rules were drawn up in response to Brexit, which will result in Europe's biggest clearing house for euro-denominated transactions like interest rate swaps, London-based LCH LSE.L, being located outside the bloc.  Unless the Bank of England agrees to joint supervision of LCH, the clearer may have to shift euro-denominated operations to the EU or risk losing the business.  The draft rules have led to accusations of regulatory overreach in the United States, home to clearers like CME CME.O and ICE ICE.N.  Giancarlo said that unless the EU rules were watered down so that the bloc\u2019s regulators \u201cdefer\u201d to U.S. counterparts when it comes to supervising American clearing houses, the CFTC could effectively bar U.S. securities houses from trading on EU exchanges.  Latest figures from the EU\u2019s securities watchdog ESMA on the bloc\u2019s 660 trillion euro derivatives market, published on Thursday, highlighted London\u2019s dominance in heavily traded products like interest rate swaps.  The European Commission said it offers greater deference to the CFTC than vice versa.  \u201cThe objective of the proposed new framework of CCP supervision is to ...adapt our supervisory framework to the evolving circumstances in European derivatives markets,\u201d a Commission spokesman said.  \u201cWe look forward to continuing the dialogue on this matter.\u201d","425":"LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - British companies have been swept up in a global boom in dealmaking that has seen the amount of M&A involving UK firms hit its highest level since 2007.  Britain\u2019s M&A market has remained buoyant despite the country\u2019s looming exit from the European Union a year from now, a prospect which has cast uncertainty over British companies\u2019 access to the single market.  Rather than deter businesses from striking deals, however, it has prompted them to prepare for Brexit by acquiring rivals to build scale.  The availability of cheap debt, high equity valuations that are allowing companies to use their stock to pay for acquisitions, and economic growth are all behind the surge in M&A, bankers said.  The value of M&A volumes involving British businesses rose by 56.5 percent to $164.3 billion during the first quarter, the most since the $166.3 billion recorded in the same period 11 years ago, Thomson Reuters data show.  Including plans by Anglo-Dutch Unilever and RELX to abandon their dual listing structures, total deal levels hit $280.8 billion in the first three months of 2018 in the UK, according to the data.  It means that Britain remained the second biggest country for deals behind the U.S. Globally, dealmaking surged 67 percent to almost $1.2 trillion, the data show.  In Britain this week alone, U.S. exchange operator CME Group agreed to buy British financial technology firm NEX for about 3.9 billion pounds ($5.5 billion) and Japan\u2019s Takeda Pharmaceutical said it was considering an approach for FTSE 100 drugmaker Shire, which has a market value of about 32 billion pounds.  \u201cThis feels like it\u2019s going to be a big year for M&A,\u201d said Alison Harding-Jones, the head of European, Middle East and Africa M&A at Citigroup. \u201cThis is not just UK based and is driven by a perfect storm of all the ingredients you need for deals.\u201d  \u201cBREXIT SQUEEZE\u201d  British companies are bulking up in preparation for the post-Brexit era.  Dwayne Lysaght, the head of UK M&A at JP Morgan Cazenove, said there is \u201ca bit of a Brexit squeeze which is encouraging a focus on domestic consolidation.\u201d  \u201cBritish companies are acknowledging the need to be bigger to compete in a more open, global market place,\u201d he added.  Domestic deals totalled $43.3 billion in value during the first quarter, up from $24.9 billion a year earlier, the Thomson Reuters data show.  They include events and exhibitions business Informa\u2019s 3.9 billion-pound deal to acquire rival UBM and the sale of Standard Life Aberdeen\u2019s insurance business to Phoenix for 3.2 billion pounds.  The biggest is Melrose Industries 8 billion-pound hostile offer for aerospace and automotive parts supplier GKN , which was Britain\u2019s largest hostile bid since Kraft swooped on Cadbury in 2009. Melrose will find out later on Thursday whether enough GKN investors have accepted its offer.  Stripping out Unilever and RELX, outbound M&A volumes were$27.2 billion, down from $42.3 billion in 2017, while inbound deals rose to $77.9 billion pounds, from $17.5 billion a year earlier, according to the data.  TOP OF THE MARKET?  The biggest bid by an overseas acquirer for a British group was Comcast\u2019s potential 22.1 billion-pound proposal for Sky, an attempt by the U.S. giant to gatecrash the takeover the broadcaster agreed with its 39 percent shareholder Twenty-First Century Fox late in 2016.  Both Fox\u2019s pending bid for Sky and Melrose\u2019s pursuit of GKN have drawn considerable scrutiny from British lawmakers.  The former has raised concerns about Rupert Murdoch\u2019s influence over the UK media landscape, while the latter has sparked fears Melrose will break-up GKN, which is a mainstay of Britain\u2019s engineering sector.  Indeed, under Theresa May, who became prime minister in July 2016, the British government has adopted a more interventionist stance towards M&A by foreign companies.  In October, it proposed new rules that would give lawmakers more say over takeovers of firms involved in the more sensitive technology and defence sectors.  Even so, that stance has not deterred overseas businesses from attempting to buy British firms, said Dominic Morris, the head of UK M&A at law firm Allen & Overy.  \u201cYes, you could argue the government\u2019s being more activist to some degree and people have to be mindful of that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut do I think it\u2019s right up there at the top of (acquirer\u2019s) agenda?

The rush to buy stocks, and especially tech stocks, came as more people took up trading from home while under lockdown, encouraged by the recent move by retail brokerages to offer commission-free trading.

Spot gold jumped 1.6% to $1,942.45 per ounce by 0816 GMT, rebounding from a 2.5% drop in early Asian trade. U.S. gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,949.40.

This has supported the sharp rebound in gold and silver,\" said Jigar Trivedi, commodities analyst at Mumbai broker Anand Rathi Shares.

The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) said that around $200 trillion in U.S. dollar-based derivatives and loans are based on Libor, with derivatives accounting for around 95 percent of the exposures.  That is 25 percent higher than previous estimates. \u201cThe vast scale and broad scope of this activity underscores the necessity of promoting robust alternatives to Libor,\u201d the ARRC said in a report.  Regulators including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are seeking to reduce markets\u2019 reliance on Libor due to the decline in loans backing the rate.  If the rate stops being published \u201cthat has all the potential of being a pretty significant financial stability problem,\u201d Powell said last Tuesday.  Reforms to banking and money market fund regulations, along with allegations of Libor manipulation before and during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, has resulted in fewer interbank short-term loans and reduced funds\u2019 demand for bank debt, so Libor rates are sometimes estimated rather than based on actual transactions.  The ARRC in June voted to adopt an interest rate benchmark from the U.S. Treasuries-backed repurchase agreement market (repo) as an alternative to the use of Libor in exchange and privately traded derivatives.  The New York Federal Reserve said last week it will begin publishing the new reference rate on April 3, and the CME Group CME.O said it will launch futures based on the repo rate on May 7.  To help markets move away from Libor, the ARRC said it will also seek the creation of a forward-looking term rate that is based on derivatives backed by the repo benchmark.  The group will also expand its membership and working groups to include more market participants that will examine contracts for loans and other instruments based on Libor, with a view to identifying appropriate fallback rates in the event that Libor stops publication.","437":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - CME Group CME.O, one of the world's largest exchange operators, on Wednesday reported a drop in second-quarter earnings, partly due to higher expenses as it integrates the recent $5 billion acquisition of trading platform operator NEX.

J. Christopher Giancarlo Chairman, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, speaks at the Milken Institute 21st Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  In a speech that will be widely seen as targeting the European Union, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Christopher Giancarlo said the agency was guilty of overreach by regulating firms that were not based in the United States but did business with U.S. customers.  He said it was not surprising the foreign regulators did the same.  This \u201coverly expansive, unduly complex\u201d approach has shown insufficient deference to other countries even though they comply with the same international standards applied in the United States.  The CFTC will soon publish a \u201cWhite Paper\u201d setting out a more thoughtful \u201cnext act\u201d for regulating the cross border swaps market, Giancarlo told an audience in London\u2019s financial district.  \u201cIn a number of areas, the White Paper will recognize deficiencies in the CFTC\u2019s current approach to regulating cross-border activities and seek to recalibrate the CFTC\u2019s cross-border approach based on a set of guiding principles,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe CFTC should pursue multilateralism, not unilateralism for swaps reforms that are designed to mitigate systemic risk,\u201d he said.  Giancarlo said the aim was to spur dialogue among CFTC commissioners before a final decision was taken. He said he was meeting with regulators in the EU and Japan later in the week.  The next version of CFTC cross-border rules would focus better on addressing systemic risks from foreign firms to the U.S. financial system, leaving supervision of trading practices and market structures like clearing houses to their home supervisor, he said.  Scott O\u2019Malia, a former CFTC commissioner and now chief executive of global derivatives industry body ISDA, said he welcomed the thoughtful, risk-based approach.  Giancarlo\u2019s pledge follows CFTC criticism of overreach in a draft EU law that would give EU regulators a role in supervising U.S.-based clearing houses that service customers in the bloc, encroaching on the CFTC\u2019s turf.  Giancarlo has said it should be amended to avoid harm to U.S. businesses, saying the EU should defer to the CFTC when it comes to supervising American clearing houses.  \u201cI have been pretty firm with our friends in Brussels, the notion that there would be two sets of hands on the steering wheel is not something that we would support,\u201d Giancarlo said on Tuesday.  BREXIT BOOST?  Giancarlo said an approach based on deference when it comes to margin, trading venues, clearing houses or other areas was essential to ensuring a strong and stable derivatives market that supports economic growth within and outside the United States.  The call for a \u201cdeference\u201d-based approach between regulators from different countries will be welcomed by Britain in its bid to maintain London as Europe\u2019s biggest center for clearing euro-denominated derivatives after leaving the EU next March.  Financial industry officials in the City are seeking to enlist global support to persuade the EU to \u201cenhance\u201d or broaden its system of financial market access in time for Brexit.  But France has said large chunks of euro clearing should move to the euro zone after Brexit so that EU regulators can supervise the activity properly.  Britain says this is not necessary as it will still be complying with the same international financial rules as those enforced in the bloc.  Asked if the CFTC would implement the new approach unilaterally, Giancarlo said the agency would be \u201cvery cognizant\u201d of what foreign regulators do before deciding whether to defer to them. He declined to give any timeline.","442":"(Reuters) - CME Group Inc CME.O said on Tuesday it will reopen its eurodollar options trading pit on Aug. 10, making it the latest U.S. exchange operator to resume open outcry trading, which had been put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.

A pro-brexit sign is seen outside the Houses of Parliament, in Westminster, in London, Britain January 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Hannah Mckay  U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Christopher Giancarlo said the agreement underlined London\u2019s status as a global financial center, now and \u201cfor a long time to come\u201d.  Derivatives are widely used by companies to hedge themselves against unexpected moves in borrowing costs, currencies or raw materials prices.  \u201cMarket participants can be confident that the clearing and trading of derivatives between the UK and U.S. will maintain the high standards of today when the UK leaves the EU,\u201d Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told a news conference.  Currently, derivatives trading in Britain conforms to rules written by the European Union, the trading bloc that the United Kingdom is due to leave on March 29.  U.S. and UK regulators told reporters on Monday that the trading and clearing of derivatives transactions in London and New York that account for 80 percent of the world\u2019s off-exchange traded contracts would continue under a similar set of rules once Brexit takes place.  U.S. and UK regulators will allow trading and clearing houses for derivatives to operate on each other\u2019s markets.  With just over a month to go, it is still unclear if Britain will leave the EU with a transition agreement to minimize economic disruption or crash out with no deal.  The steps announced by the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Monday aim to reassure markets that derivatives will not be disrupted even if there is a \u201chard\u201d Brexit.  CFTC\u2019s Giancarlo said the measures provide a \u201cbridge over Brexit\u201d through a durable regulatory framework which the thriving transatlantic derivatives market may continue and endure.  \u201cIt\u2019s about continuity.

Scott O\u2019Malia, head of ISDA, the global derivatives industry body, said the pact would help ensure the safe and efficient functioning of the market.  The EU has also taken steps to ensure that a no-deal Brexit would not freeze cross-border derivatives clearing, given that LCH dominates clearing of euro-denominated interest rate swaps. But a longer-term relationship has yet to be worked out.  Catherine McGuinness, policy chief for the City of London financial district, said it was critical that EU regulators urgently address other remaining no-deal Brexit \u201ccliff-edge\u201d issues such as continuity in derivatives contracts.  The U.S. measures are permanent and also cover trading in derivatives, while the time-limited EU step covers clearing only.  The EU is meanwhile toughening up requirements for foreign clearing houses that want to serve EU customers by insisting it could tell them what to do in a crisis, a step Britain and the United States are resisting.  This is widely viewed as an attempt to force some derivatives business to move to the EU.  Carney said splitting the market could bump up costs for users by 20 billion euros.

It is unclear at times which financial rules, if any, apply to the sector or if there is legal authority to regulate it.  Start ups have begun issuing new digital currencies via initial coin offerings (ICOs), raising concern among regulators over investor protection.  The aim of the new framework is to spot any financial stability risks early enough to take action.  The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation for the Group of 20 Economies (G20), said the framework focuses on how risks from crypto asset markets could spread to other parts of the financial system.  \u201cMonitoring the size and growth of crypto-asset markets is critical to understanding the potential size of wealth effects, should valuations fall,\u201d the FSB said in a statement on Monday.  \u201cThe use of leverage, and financial institution exposures to crypto-asset markets are important metrics of transmission of crypto-asset risks to the broader financial system.\u201d  The aim of the new framework is to spot any financial stability risks early enough to take action.  But the FSB cautioned that data is still patchy at times in a rapidly developing market that can be fragmented and opaque. It would assess whether the framework will need extra data at a later stage.  Moves to formally monitor the sector forms part of a compromise in March between G20 members like France, who wanted more radical action, and other countries who preferred treading lightly for now.  The FSB framework also includes trading volumes, pricing, clearing and margining for derivatives linked to crypto assets, such as the bitcoin futures launched by CME Group CME.O last December.  Crypto assets in general and crypto asset trading platforms do not pose global financial stability risks, but they raise other significant concerns, including consumer and investor protection, market integrity and money laundering\/terrorism financing, the FSB said.  It said its affiliate, the Basel Committee, which writes bank capital standards, is conducting an \u201cinitial stocktake\u201d of banks\u2019 exposures to crypto assets.  The committee is also looking at whether regulators are forcing lenders to set aside capital against holdings of crypto assets, and considering whether to rewrite its rules to explicitly require such holdings to be covered.","449":"PARIS (Reuters) - Euronext ENX.PA plans to develop commodity contracts based on cash settlement to expand a business in which the financial market operator has so far offered physical delivery of crops like wheat.

Euronext's commodity business is dominated by its French-based wheat futures BL2c1 that are a benchmark for the European grain market.  Its wheat and other agricultural futures allow physical delivery at the expiry of a contract in order to connect derivative prices with cash markets.  However, Euronext\u2019s acquisition this year of Norwegian stock exchange Oslo Bors for 700 million euros ($770 million) brought under its control a salmon derivatives market that is cash-settled.  Cash settlement ties the expiry process to a price benchmark for the physical market and avoids constraints of managing delivery systems.  CME Group CME.O adopted cash-settled Russian wheat and Ukrainian maize contracts after an unsuccessful attempt at delivery-based futures in the Black Sea grain export region.  Euronext, which on Thursday unveiled financial targets for 2019-2022, also said it would try to boost its commodity activity by targeting customers in the United States and northern and eastern Europe.  At the same time, Euronext reiterated that it wants to extend its delivery network for core commodity contracts that also include maize (corn) and rapeseed.","450":"(Adds more detail)  LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Clearing houses for securities in the United States will be allowed to serve investors in the European Union, the bloc\u2019s executive European Commission said on Wednesday.  \u201cThis decision is a significant first step in the process of recognising U.S. central counterparties registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the European Union,\u201d the EU\u2019s financial services chief Mairead McGuinness said in a statement.  Clearers registered with the SEC include DTCC, ICE Clear and London Stock Exchange\u2019s Paris-based LCH SA.  Clearing houses ensure the completion of a stock trade even if one side of the deal goes bust, and the EU had already granted market access for U.S. clearing houses for derivatives.  But Wednesday\u2019s open-ended \u201cequivalence\u201d decision by Brussels contrasts with the time-limited access the EU has given clearers in Britain since it fully left the bloc on Dec. 31.  UK clearers, including the London arm of LCH, only have access for 18 months until June 2022, time the EU said this week that banks in the bloc should use to shift chunks of their euro derivatives positions to the euro zone.  The EU executive said U.S. securities clearers must respect certain risk management requirements known as \u201cliquidation periods\u201d and \u201canti-procyclicality measures\u201d to activate EU access.  The EU wants to avoid U.S. clearers having a competitive advantage over European peers due to having less restrictive versions of such rules.","451":"LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The European Union defended proposed new derivatives clearing rules on Thursday after criticism from the United States, saying the bloc has every right to supervise foreign financial firms that serve EU customers.  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair Christopher Giancarlo threatened retaliation on Wednesday unless the EU watered down the draft rules, which set out tougher conditions for foreign clearing houses doing business in the bloc.  They include allowing EU regulators to directly supervise foreign clearing houses on their home turf in some instances.  For two regulators to air their differences so publicly is rare.  European Commission spokesman Johannes Bahrke said the proposed EU regulations were actually based on existing U.S. rules.  \u201cIt is the prerogative of the EU legislator to set the general supervisory framework for central counterparties (CCPs) active in the EU and we would expect third country authorities to respect that, just as we respect the rules and legislative procedures in other countries,\u201d Bahrke said in a statement.  \u201cWe reiterate that the cooperative oversight we have proposed is modelled for systemically important cross-border CCPs on the United States\u2019 own supervisory system,\u201d Bahrke said.  The EU rules were drawn up in response to Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc, which will result in Europe\u2019s biggest clearing house for euro-denominated transactions like interest rate swaps, London-based LCH, being located outside the bloc.  Unless the Bank of England agrees to joint supervision of LCH, the clearer may have to shift euro-denominated operations to the EU or risk losing the business.  The draft rules have led to accusations of regulatory overreach in the United States, home to clearers like CME and ICE.  Giancarlo said that unless the EU rules were watered down so that the bloc\u2019s regulators \u201cdefer\u201d to U.S. counterparts when it comes to supervising American clearing houses, the CFTC could effectively bar U.S. securities houses from trading on EU exchanges.  Latest figures from the EU\u2019s securities watchdog ESMA on the bloc\u2019s 660 trillion euro derivatives market, published on Thursday, highlighted London\u2019s dominance in heavily traded products like interest rate swaps.  Bahrke said the EU is globally the most open jurisdiction when it comes to deferring to equivalent third country regulators, and offers greater deference to the CFTC than vice versa.  \u201cThe objective of the proposed new framework of CCP supervision is to maintain that openness and adapt our supervisory framework to the evolving circumstances in European derivatives markets,\u201d Bahrke said.  \u201cWe look forward to continuing the dialogue on this matter.\u201d","452":"LONDON (Reuters) - Global regulators have tightened their scrutiny of whether clearing houses hold enough capital and cash to avoid calling on taxpayers in a crisis, according to new guidelines published on Monday by the Financial Stability Board (FSB).  However, a key demand from a group of major global banks and investors that clearing houses themselves should take on more of the financial burden of any market losses has been kicked down the road.  The FSB, which coordinates financial rules for the Group of 20 Economies (G20), said the recent market turmoil due to the COVID-19 pandemic had demonstrated the benefits effective clearing brings to markets.  Clearing houses are already required to have default funds to ensure a trade is completed even if one side of a transaction goes bust, and the fund must be big enough to cope with its two biggest members failing.  The new guidance also now sets out how the default fund must be replenished after covering losses.  But the shift to central clearing of derivatives to improve transparency in markets since the financial crisis a decade ago has further increased the systemic importance of clearing houses and more work was needed, the FSB said.  Such work next year will consider rules on the use, composition and amount of financial resources clearers should have if they find themselves on the brink of collapse and need \u201cresolving\u201d, or closing down, it said.  \u201cThis would include assessing whether any new types of pre-funded resources would be necessary to enhance central counterparty resolvability,\u201d the FSB said.  Earlier this year, nine global banks and investment management companies said clearing houses needed to have more of their own capital at risk as an incentive to limit risky trading.  The group also wants a bigger say in how clearing houses are run as they worry that they, as members, will end up plugging the losses if clearers are not properly resourced.  However, clearers argue that it is members such as banks that create the risk and therefore they should be contributing to the clearers default fund.","453":"March 9 (Reuters) -  * CME GROUP CEO DUFFY SAYS THERE\u2019S LACK OF CLARITY ABOUT CORONAVIRUS IN THE MARKETS AND IT REMINDS HIM OF 2008 CRISIS - CNBC INTERVIEW  * CME GROUP CEO DUFFY SAYS MARKETS HATE UNCERTAINTY AND \"THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE NOW\" IN RELATION TO CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK Source text : cnb.cx\/3aHtewu Further company coverage:","454":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s financial watchdog will likely zero in on a chunky pound futures deal, which many reckon drove sterling\u2019s mystery spike just seconds before the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate announcement this week  FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a board displaying buying and selling rates outside of a currency exchange outlet in London, Britain, July 31, 2019. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo  The currency\u2019s jump to $1.3075 from $1.3024 in less than a minute before the central bank kept rates on hold -- instead of cutting as some had expected -- has raised questions on whether any market players knew of the decision before it became public.  While it is possible that the moves were coincidental, the Financial Conduct Authority said it would look into the issue in response to a request from the central bank.  But given the watchdog has regulatory oversight over derivatives rather than spot exchange rate markets, it will likely focus on the 100 million pounds in orders for sterling futures placed seconds before prices spiked, according to data from the CME, the world\u2019s largest futures exchange operator.  The CME page does not reveal who placed the bid for the chunky futures order, but Refinitiv data shows the pound quoted by a major bank at $1.3064 in the spot market, seven seconds before the BOE announcement hit newswires. That was 40 pips above the $1.3022 level contributed by another big bank two seconds earlier.  Any action in the futures market translates quickly into the spot market, analysts say.  There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by the banks which can place orders on behalf of clients or just submit price quotes as market makers.  Rachel Kent, a securities lawyer at Hogan Lovells noted spot exchange rate markets do not come under the market abuse rules that allow regulators to fine firms for misconduct.  But the FCA could have room for enforcement if it were clear the sterling spike directly affected instruments that are regulated by the body, such as derivatives, she said.  In theory, it could also fall back on the FX code of conduct, a voluntary set of rules which were introduced globally after banks were fined for trying to rig currency markets. A senior manager at each regulated firm is legally accountable for upholding the code.  Regulated firms are also required to abide by the FCA\u2019s so-called general principles, a breach of which was used to fine banks for seeking to manipulate the Libor interest rate benchmark.  \u201cIf you are a regulated firm and even if the code is voluntary, the FCA could justify taking action for failure to act with integrity under one of its principles,\u201d Kent added.  The incident comes as FCA boss Andrew Bailey prepares to take over as BoE governor in March.  What\u2019s more, BoE\u2019s request for an FCA investigation is the second of this nature in recent weeks. In December the central bank said a rogue supplier had misused audio feeds from its news conferences, giving traders access to potentially market-moving information seconds before rivals.  The bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee members vote on interest rates a day before the announcement. BoE staff then write the minutes and a Monetary Policy Summary which are published along with the decision at 1200 GMT on Thursday.  \u201cThere is confidential information circulating in the Bank for quite a long time,\u201d former MPC member Andrew Sentance told the BBC\u2019s Today program, though he urged markets not to \u201cjump to conclusions.\u201d  The FX community meanwhile continues to debate the topic, with traders and analysts interviewed by Reuters calling on regulators and market participants to get to the bottom of the issue quickly.  \u201cBanks have the means to look into it.

The Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) said shorter hours would be a move in the wrong direction. The current European trading day is 0900-1730 continental European time, longer than in Asia or Wall Street.  This means that share trading spans the Asian market close and the open on Wall Street, and a shorter day could put Europe at a competitive disadvantage to rival trading venues in other parts of the world, FESE said.  The London Stock Exchange, which is not a member of FESE, held a public consultation earlier this year that found broad backing for cutting the trading day by 90 minutes to improve mental wellbeing and help attract more women onto trading floors.  But without a harmonised approach across Europe, the goals of shorter hours would be harder to achieve given banks have pan-European trading desks, the LSE has said.  London will also be leery of putting itself at any competitive disadvantage to rival bourses on the continent now that Britain has left the European Union.  FESE said the length of the trading day does not have a negative impact on the working culture of trading and that other measures like more shifts were necessary to achieve that.  Britain\u2019s Investment Association and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, a banking lobby, reiterated their calls on Tuesday for a cut in trading hours.  Pan-European Exchange Euronext has just completed its own public consultation on market hours. Euronext, which is a vice-president of FESE, has already expressed scepticism about what it has called a \u201cLondon proposal\u201d.","456":"(Adds analyst comments and updates prices) * Commodity currencies slip against the dollar, yen * 16.8 mln U.S. jobless claims since week ended March 21 * Interactive graphic tracking the global spread: open tmsnrt.rs\/3aIRuz7 in an external browser By K.

Spot gold slipped 0.4% to $1,682.65 per ounce by 0522 GMT, having risen to its highest since March 9 on Friday. U.S. gold futures fell 1.1% to $1,732.90. \"We're seeing a little bit of reversal of Friday night's move, which was driven by the Fed's latest policy action.

Not only does it improve the opportunity cost for holding gold but at some stage it will eventually water down the dollar,\" said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at financial services firm AxiCorp. European Union finance ministers also agreed on half-a-trillion euros worth of economic support but left open the question of how to finance recovery in the bloc headed for a steep recession. Commodity currencies slipped against safe-haven units such as the dollar and yen as a record output cut agreed by major oil producing nations failed to offset broader concerns about global demand for resources, while world shares fell as investors braced for more economic damages from the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, major physical bullion hubs saw activity dwindle last week due to coronavirus-led restrictions, with strained supply chains cut off from soaring safe-haven demand in some regions.

Following Thursday\u2019s meeting between the prime ministers of Ireland and Britain, hopes for a divorce settlement have increased.  The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) set out guidance on Friday on what it will do if there is no deal by Brexit day, which is likely to roil investors and markets.  Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union is due to take place on a Thursday.  Typically banks and brokers need a weekend to adapt to such major changes that will affect IT systems used for mandatory reporting of stock, bond and derivatives trades to regulators.  \u201cThe FCA is aware that leaving the EU during the working week could pose operational challenges for firms,\u201d the watchdog said in a statement.  \u201cThe FCA will take a proportionate and pragmatic approach to supervising reporting around exit day.\u201d  A no-deal Brexit would split cross-border stock markets, and the FCA has yet to say how it would respond to this.  If there is a deal, it would be business as usual for Britain\u2019s financial sector during a transition period.  The FCA said firms that are not able to comply fully with securities reporting requirements around Brexit day will need to be able to back-report missing, incomplete or inaccurate transactions as soon as possible thereafter.  For derivatives trades, market participants should have all trades reported to a trade repository no later than Nov. 4.  It echoes comments from the Bank of England which said this week that banks and the broader financial system were well prepared for a disorderly Brexit.  The FCA said it had taken into account statements this week from the EU\u2019s European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which said on Monday there was still a high level of uncertainty as to the final timing and conditions of Brexit.  Many banks, insurers and trading platforms in London have opened hubs in the bloc to ensure continued access for EU customers.  The EU\u2019s European Banking Authority (EBA) said this week that banks must guard against complacency and press ahead with building out their new EU operations.  \u201cNotably, to ensure that assets, appropriate staff and data are in place to support relevant authorizations and that customers are adequately informed,\u201d EBA said.","458":"(Adds CME Group comment)  March 25 (Reuters) - U.S. exchange operator CME Group on Tuesday announced a new gold futures contract to combat price volatility caused by the shutdown of gold supply routes, but traders and bankers said it would not immediately calm markets.  Gold prices in London and New York diverged sharply on Tuesday as the coronavirus outbreak grounded planes and closed precious metals refineries. Traders worried they would be unable to move gold from London to New York.  The price gap disrupted trading in the London market and caused a plunge in liquidity.  Major gold trading banks and the London Bullion Market Association asked the CME to change its rules to accept 400-ounce bars in London against its contracts, removing the need to reshape and transport metal and allowing prices to normalise, sources told Reuters on Tuesday.  London, a leading gold storage hub, runs on 400-ounce gold bars while the CME\u2019s Comex exchange uses 100-ounce bars.  CME instead said it would launch new gold futures that could be settled using 400-ounce, 100-ounce and 1-kilogram gold bars and instruments to link these with its existing contracts.  \u201cThis new contract will provide customers with maximum flexibility in managing physical delivery,\u201d said Derek Sammann, CME\u2019s global head of commodity and options products.  It is not an immediate fix, John Reade, chief market strategist at the World Gold Council, said.  \u201cAll the open interest at the moment is in the old contract. How long does it take to navigate from the old to the new? Months?,\u201d he said. \u201cIt solves things potentially in the long term, but doesn\u2019t do anything for the market now.\u201d  CME Group said there were legal and regulatory concerns with changing existing and widely-used contracts. \u201cWe always work to preserve the integrity of each contract for all open interest holders \u2013 short and long,\u201d it said.  Gold futures on Comex were trading around $1,640 an ounce at 1600 GMT while London spot metal cost around $1,605. The gap ballooned to as much as $70 on Tuesday - the biggest premium for Comex futures in at least 40 years.  Usually the two trade within a few dollars of one another.  Liquidity and pricing on spot gold and the contract used to bridge the London and New York prices - known as an exchange-for-physical (EFP) contract \u2013 had improved from Tuesday, traders said.  But conditions remained difficult, with the spread between offered buy and sell prices for spot gold - normally below 50 cents \u2013 ranging from $5-$20 an ounce on trading platforms run by banks and brokers, having risen as high as $50 the previous day, traders said.  \u201c(The) market is still stressed and thin,\u201d said one, adding that traders were waiting for clarity from the CME on how the new contracts would work.

Spot gold ticked up 0.2% to $1,651.51 per ounce by 0739 GMT, after climbing to its highest since March 10 on Tuesday at $1,671.40. U.S. gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,689.80. \"Fundamentals are still bullish, but in the short term the market will take cues from every bit of news that pops up,\" said Avtar Sandu, a senior commodities manager at Phillip Futures, adding that a firmer dollar and profit-taking weighed on prices. Asian stocks were mixed after two sessions of sharp gains as investors tempered their optimism about the coronavirus while death tolls were still mounting across the globe. The virus has infected more than 1.38 million people globally and the death toll crossed 81,400, and though the numbers are still rising in many highly populated countries, tentative improvements had given hope. New York state, the U.S. epicentre of the pandemic, reported its sharpest single-day spike in fatalities and Spain's daily toll of deaths rose for the first time in five days, while new cases in mainland China nearly doubled in 24 hours due to infected overseas travellers. In a bid to support economies hammered by the outbreak, governments and central banks around the world have unleashed unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday declared a state of emergency to fight the outbreak and rolled out a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package to soften the economic blow. \"In the mid to long term, gold has upside due to quantitative easing and monetary stimulus efforts by global central banks,\" said CMC Markets analyst Margaret Yang Yan. Capping bullion's gains, the dollar gained 0.4% against key rivals, as investors returned to safe-havens. On Tuesday, the greenback posted its worst drop in nearly two weeks.

It has long been regarded as the \"baby brother\" of AIM, the bigger growth market run by the London Stock Exchange LSE.L.

Over the past decade, the Shanghai bourse which was set up in 1999 has carved out a bigger share of the global copper futures market, challenging the London Metal Exchange\u2019s (LME) near dominance as China\u2019s economy boomed and retail investors flocked to commodities futures trading.  Now it wants a part of the burgeoning options business.  Volumes of copper options traded on the LME totaled around $265 billion last year at current prices, up 0.3 percent on a year earlier, while Comex copper options traded on CME Group almost tripled to 104,490 lots in 2017, worth about $7.3 billion.  Some Chinese copper firms already trade options on the established London and New York markets, but others are not able to stump up the foreign currency required as collateral for trading. The ShFE copper contract is denominated in yuan.  \u201cAt the moment, ShFE copper options can be best seen as alternative to onshore market participants with restricted or no access to LME copper options,\u201d said Rochelle Wei, CEO of J.P. Morgan Futures Co.  Hedging in China rather than overseas may also better reflect the domestic market for local players, said Qiu Guoyang, assistant general manager at Shenzhen-based brokerage Jinrui Futures.  He expected the ShFE launch to eventually have an impact on options volumes on the LME, which was founded in 1877, although not in the short term.  In an emailed response, the LME said it sees the Chinese market as a complementary trading system \u201cstimulating arbitrage flow and helping to grow the market as a whole.\u201d  CME global head of metals, Young-Jin Chang, also welcomed the new product and noted that 20 percent of its volume originates outside U.S. trading hours, pointing to demand in Asia.  GOING GLOBAL  Underscoring its determination to support the options contract, the ShFE has lined up 18 market makers, to fuel activity, far more than the handful that is usual for international exchanges.  Those include a unit of Jinrui Futures, a subsidiary of Jiangxi Copper Co,, one of China\u2019s biggest copper smelters, and state-run diversified metals firm China Minmetals Corp.  Swiss commodity trading house, Trafigura, which has a China-based trading unit, will also be involved in the first day of trading, a spokesperson said.  Success may depend on whether smelters and fabricators use the home product for hedging or if it becomes a playground for speculative investors, who often dominate other Chinese futures markets, like iron ore and coal, and cause wild volatility in prices, analysts said.  Launching an options contract will also help ShFE garner more traction with international players as it prepares to open its copper futures contract to foreign investors.  ShFE has not given a date for the internationalisation yet.  The exchange launched a crude oil futures contract [0#ISC:] in March that aims to compete with rival global benchmarks and the Dalian Commodity Exchange opened its iron ore futures [0#DCIO:] to outside investors in May.","463":"LONDON (Reuters) - With bitcoin surging to the cusp of its 2017 all-time high, backers are hoping fewer frenzied retail investors means less chance of a crash this time around.  But with little mainstream usage as a form of payment and global uncertainty clouding financial markets, bitcoin is still far from a safe bet, analysts said.  \u201cThere are a lot of differences to what was happening before,\u201d said Larry Cermak, director of research at cryptocurrency media firm The Block.  \u201cThe price has steadily increased, we are seeing very little retail participation and markets are much more liquid and much more accessible to institutional participants. For now, though, it\u2019s definitely not a safe investment, it\u2019s still very risky.\u201d  Bitcoin broke $18,000 on Wednesday to hit its highest since Dec. 2017, having soared about 160% this year.  The steep trajectory of its 2020 rally echoes that of 2017, when a retail-led buying spree pushed it to nearly $20,000, only to crash more than 50% a month later.  Unlike 2017, however, the asset now boasts a functioning derivatives market and custody services by established financial institutions.  The value of open interest bitcoin futures at CME Group Inc crossed $1 billion this week for the first time since their launch in Dec. 2017, while positions across major options markets have grown to over $4 billion from virtually nothing in early 2019, according to crypto data provider Skew.  Meanwhile large firms including Fidelity Investments and Japan\u2019s Nomura Holdings Inc have starting safeguarding bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for institutional investors.  FILE PHOTO: A Bitcoin logo is seen on a cryptocurrency ATM in Santa Monica, California, U.S., January 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no comparison in terms of market maturity between this year and 2017,\u201d said Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto data firm Messari. \u201cBack then derivatives and credit markets barely existed (and) institutional custody didn\u2019t exist.\u201d  The emergence of this kind of infrastructure has made it easier for professional investors from hedge funds to family offices to seek exposure to crypto.  \u201cThe accessibility has changed from three years ago so the types of players that are willing to go in has broadened,\u201d said Tim Swanson, head of market intelligence at blockchain software firm Clearmatics.  Their involvement, the argument goes, may lead to more liquidity and less volatility in prices.  Regulation has also developed. While the cryptocurrency sector is still mostly lightly overseen or unregulated, global standards on areas such as anti-money laundering (AML) have emerged, opening the way for bigger investors.  Mainstream companies and governments are among those embracing digital coin technology.  Last month, PayPal Holdings Inc said it would open up its platform to cryptocurrencies while rival Square Inc said it had invested 1% of its total assets in bitcoin.  Unlike 2017, bitcoin\u2019s price has been supported by an appetite for riskier assets following government and central bank stimulus measures to combat the impact of COVID-19.  Bitcoin\u2019s supply is capped at 21 million, shielding it from policies that stoke inflation, proponents say.  The narrative has allowed \u201ca wider group of investors, including those with a more fundamental mindset, to participate in price setting,\u201d said Richard Galvin of crypto fund Digital Asset Capital Management.  Yet for all the improvements in market structure and mainstream recognition, bitcoin remains highly volatile. The cryptocurrency sector is still more opaque and less regulated than mainstream financial markets. Trading data remains patchy and concerns over market manipulation are rife.  \u201cLong story short, it\u2019s still a risky market and a risky asset,\u201d said Colin Platt, a cryptocurrency consultant.  And for all the hype, bitcoin remains seldom used for its intended purpose.  \u201cThere is no guarantee that it will be used widely as \u2018money\u2019 given the cost of mining and using bitcoins and the ease of using contactless payment cards or smartphones to facilitate electronic payment,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.","464":"NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Miami International Securities Exchange (MIAX) and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGEX) said on Monday they plan to launch futures on the SPIKES Volatility Index on Nov. 18, ramping up competition with Cboe Global Markets\u2019 Volatility Index, or VIX.  The futures contracts follow MIAX\u2019s launch of options on SPIKES in February and will allow the exchange operator to offer exchange-traded funds based on the index, which tracks the expected 30-day volatility of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, the world\u2019s most actively traded ETF.  The futures also provide hedging and could lead to higher demand for SPIKES options.  \u201cThe SPIKES future is completing the two products we wanted to launch to go after the monopoly that Cboe has through the VIX in volatility,\u201d Thomas Gallagher, MIAX\u2019s chief executive officer, said.  SPIKES options volumes have picked up in recent months, but so far they have had little success in drawing volatility traders\u2019 business away from the Cboe\u2019s VIX complex of volatility products, generally referred to as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge.  There have been about 130,000 SPIKES options contracts traded to date. By comparison, Cboe\u2019s VIX options boast an average daily trading volume of more than 500,000 contracts, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert.  MGEX will offer the contracts through CME Group Inc\u2019s Globex electronic trading platform.  The move marks the first foray into futures for MIAX, which listed multi-listed options as well as the proprietary SPIKES options. It is also the first financial future to trade on the largely agriculture-focused MGEX.  MIAX said pricing for SPIKES futures will be made available prior to the launch, which is subject to regulatory approval, but that it would be \u201csubstantially cheaper\u201d than competing VIX products.

The announcement is another attempt to break a years-long stalemate between the clearinghouse and their customers over how much capital each should have ready to quickly absorb gigantic losses from traders going bust.  Representatives of the group said the drive to expand the coalition started before the current market turmoil. But the announcement raises timely questions about the ability of part of the financial system to hold up under extreme stress.  Strengthening rules to ensure clearinghouses could be wound down safely may be the most significant unfinished work on reforms started after the 2008 financial crisis, regulators have said.  Without much success, JPMorgan Chase & Co, JPM.N the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has been persistent in calling for clearinghouses to shoulder more risk, warning that they currently have too little incentive to protect against defaults, operational failures and cyber attacks.  JPMorgan issued papers making its case in 2014 and 2017. In October it was joined by eight other firms, including units of Allianz ALVG.DE, BlackRock Inc BLK.N and Citigroup Inc C.N in posting a new paper. That paper has now been signed by 10 more firms, including units of ABN Amro Bank ABNd.AS, Barclays Plc BARC.L, Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX, Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE, Franklin Resources BEN.N and UBS Group AGUBSG.S  After the October paper came out executives of clearinghouse operator CME Group Inc CME.O said they had told regulators they were concerned about the group's agenda.  Clearinghouses say banks, sometimes known as member firms, and their investment fund customers need to have their capital at risk as incentives to limit risky trading.  After the financial crisis, global regulators put clearinghouses at the center of trading in over-the-counter credit derivatives and interest rate swaps.  The clearinghouses, also known as central counterparties, stand between both sides of trades and ensure their completion even if one side fails.  Since the changes, central clearing of derivatives has taken off, European Central Bank board member Fabio Panetta said in a speech last month in which he lamented the \u201cstalemate\u201d between the two camps.  Companies that clear credit default swaps or interest rate swaps include units of Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N and the London Stock Exchange Group LSE.L, as well as CME Group.","468":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Grain barge shipping came to a near standstill in parts of the U.S. Midwest on Thursday as recent heavy rain and melting snow swelled rivers, halted barge loading and sidelined the towboats that haul farm belt crops to Gulf Coast export terminals.  The flooded waterways sent cash premiums for corn barges delivered to Gulf Coast terminals soaring. Rates hit peaks on Thursday that have not been seen in 18 months, as exporters scrambled to secure enough grain to top off vessels bound for overseas markets, traders said. [GRA\/F]  Barge lines suspended operations on northern sections of the Illinois River, with water levels already near record crests, or forecast to reach those levels by the weekend, according to National Weather Service river forecasts.  The flooding prompted CME Group Inc to declare a condition of force majeure on Thursday afternoon, because the majority shipping stations for its Chicago Board of Trade corn futures contracts are unable to load grain.  Several grain elevators along the lower Ohio River stopped loading barges because the rising river made it impossible for the vessels to get beneath grain spouts, according to grain barge traders.  Near Cincinnati, mariners were warned that boats may be unable to get under bridges as the river approaches an anticipated crest near 60 feet (18.3 m) early next week.  \u201cWe\u2019re all having difficulty moving stuff around right now,\u201d said a grain barge operator, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak the media.  \u201cIt\u2019s when you get on the Ohio and the Mississippi from Cairo (Illinois) and south, that\u2019s where the elevators may not be able to load and the boats may not be able to move,\u201d he said.  U.S. grain exporters such as Archer Daniels Midland Co and Bunge Ltd rely on inland rivers to transport corn, soybeans and other farm products to terminals near the Gulf of Mexico for export. Some 60 percent of all U.S. grain exports exit the country via the Gulf.  The shipping headaches come amid a recent spike in overseas demand for U.S. corn which had revived a previously sluggish export program.  Exporters have sold more than 9.1 million tonnes of corn over the past five weeks, the strongest stretch on record, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. The agency is due to release the latest week\u2019s sales data on Friday, with analysts expecting at least 1 million more tonnes of sales for the week.

FILE PHOTO: Aluminium ingots are seen stored at the foundry shop of the Rusal Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, July 27, 2016. Picture taken July 27, 2016. REUTERS\/Ilya Naymushin\/\/File Photo  In Moscow, the government pledged to provide Rusal with short-term liquidity and offer other assistance while it also considered hitting back by looking at U.S. goods or goods produced in Russia by U.S. companies.  Shares of United Company Rusal, one of the world\u2019s biggest aluminum producers, will be deleted from global equity and debt indexes while its metal will not be allowed on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and the CME Group.  The U.S. Treasury on April 6 announced sanctions against seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they own or control, saying they were profiting from a Russian state engaged in \u201cmalign activities\u201d around the world.  This included Oleg Deripaska and his Hong Kong-listed company Rusal and his newly created holding company En+ Group  The two companies will be deleted from FTSE Russell\u2019s equity indexes effective from the open on April 13, the index provider said in a statement.  Bloomberg users in Europe told Reuters that Bloomberg had stopped displaying share prices of Rusal, En+ Group and Swiss pumpmaker Sulzer, all of which are subject to the sanctions. Bloomberg declined to comment.  Rusal\u2019s shares in Hong Kong have slumped by half since the sanctions were imposed on Friday and gave up another 1.9 percent on Wednesday.  The new sanctions were an attempt to capture global markets for U.S. companies, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament.  \u201cMeasures in response should be well thought-out,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are quite a lot of products ... in our markets that we get from the USA.\u201d  Russia imported $12.5 billion worth of U.S. products in 2017, according to official Russian customs data. That included aircraft, machinery, pharmaceutical and chemical products.  DEBT, METAL EXCLUDED  On the debt front, Tradeweb, one of the world\u2019s largest bond platforms which is majority owned by Thomson Reuters Corp, said on Wednesday it no longer carried Rusal debt prices.  \u201cThe bonds have been removed from the platform,\u201d a Tradeweb spokeswoman said.  Rusal will be excluded on April 30 from JPMorgan\u2019s CEMBI index group of emerging market corporate bonds, the U.S. bank said.  The exclusion will be done as part of the end-of-month rebalancing of the indexes, it added.  As of Friday, April 6, Rusal has a weight of 0.12 percent and 0.15 percent in the CEMBI Broad Diversified and CEMBI Diversified indexes respectively, JPM said in a statement seen by Reuters that was sent to clients late on Monday.  Moody\u2019s said it was withdrawing all ratings for Rusal due to its own business reasons.  \u201cAt the time of withdrawal the ratings were: corporate family rating of Ba3 and probability of default rating of Ba3-PD At the time of withdrawal these ratings had a positive outlook,\u201d it said in a statement.  Rusal\u2019s aluminum brands are being excluded from the LME, the world\u2019s biggest market for industrial metals, and the U.S. Comex exchange owned by the CME.  The CME revoked approved status for Rusal\u2019s metal for delivery against CME aluminum futures contracts, effective from April 10, a notice on the CME website said.  The London Metal Exchange said late on Tuesday Rusal\u2019s aluminum would be suspended from its list of approved brands from April 17 after some members raised concerns about settling contracts with sanctions-hit companies.  Trader Glencore, which markets Rusal metal, is planning to declare force majeure on some aluminum supply, a source close to the matter told Reuters.  Aluminum prices extended their rally on Wednesday to a sixth straight session, hitting an 11-week peak, amid persistent worry about shortages.  Analysts at CRU say Rusal accounts for 14 percent of aluminum supplies outside top producer China. Global output this year is estimated at 65 million tonnes.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of panic and uncertainty. Buyers are scrambling to try to replace where they can, to plug the gap left by not having Russian-origin metal,\u201d said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale in London.  The sanctions have had knock-on impact on precious metal palladium, which has surged 6 percent this week on the back of concerns about supply from number one producer Russia.  Although the supply pipeline of the metal, more than two-fifths of which is sourced in Russia, has not been directly hit by the sanctions, the market has been rattled by the inclusion of Deripaska on the blacklist.  Deripaska\u2019s Rusal owns a 28 percent stake in Norilsk Nickel, the world\u2019s biggest palladium producer.","470":"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Shanghai\u2019s new yuan-denominated derivatives contract is set to propel global crude oil futures trading volumes to a record high in 2018, eating into the market share of the two most active crude contracts, Brent and WTI.  FILE PHOTO: An oil tanker unloads crude at a terminal in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, China July 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Stringer  Launched in late March by Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), China's first serious attempt to establish an Asian oil price benchmark has seen strong take-up, grabbing a spot market share of around 6 percent versus international Brent LCOc1 and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1, taken equally from both benchmarks.  Spot crude oil volumes have more than doubled globally over the past five years, but exchange data shows Brent and WTI activity will dip this year for the first time since 2013.  Brent and WTI volumes slipped to 207.2 million lots of 1,000 barrels each for this year by Dec. 10, down from 220.17 million lots in 2017.  However, adding 13 million lots of Shanghai crude oil futures ISCc1 to those of Brent and WTI, and last year's levels have been reached with around two weeks of trading left this year.

Shanghai crude\u2019s first year will have been better than Brent\u2019s, which took 3.1 percent share from dominant WTI in its 1988 launch-year.  (GRAPHIC: Shanghai crude oil futures vs Brent & WTI - tmsnrt.rs\/2Pu8WeJ)  FLAWED CONTRACT  Despite the successful launch, Shanghai crude futures are fraught with problems preventing them from becoming an efficient hedging tool for oil producers and, ultimately, a benchmark on par with Brent or WTI.  One of the main issues is a lack of international market participants.  Matt Stanley, a fuel broker with Starfuels in Dubai, said most participants in Shanghai crude futures were Chinese individuals who don\u2019t trade on market fundamentals.  \u201cIt really has no bearing on the two main benchmarks (Brent and WTI) as it is a Chinese market for the Chinese, not a Chinese market for a global trading audience,\u201d he said.  Traders said to become more successful, the market needed a more diverse group of participants, including producers, end-users and international shippers to offset the dominance of the Chinese traders.  \u201cChinese retail traders follow patterns that we in the oil industry don\u2019t, while China\u2019s oil majors also have very differing interests to us. Add intermittent trading, and this exposes us to the risk of being stuck with positions we don\u2019t want to carry,\u201d said one trader with an international oil major.  He declined to be named as his company was still in talks on joining Shanghai crude futures.  Other issues include incompatible trading hours with the rest of the world, including two short sessions between 0100 and 0700 GMT and a night session, and limited physical deliverability of its underlying crude grades in China.  (GRAPHIC: Shanghai crude oil futures volumes & prices - tmsnrt.rs\/2PuoLSH)  CHOPPY TRADING  Inconsistent trading volumes make it difficult to use Shanghai crude as a financial hedge.  \u201cFor industrial investors, they would need smooth trading of front-month to hedge risks,\u201d said Chen Kai, head of research with Chinese brokerage Shengda Futures.  After a roaring start between March and August, front-month Shanghai crude futures virtually stopped trading until November, after which activity picked up again.  Chen Kai said this behaviour by retail traders was common in China, with similar patterns seen in asphalt and metals futures.  INE declined to comment for this article.  To create more liquidity, the exchange is trying to attract so-called market makers, usually major oil producers, merchants or banks, often deployed by international exchanges such as CME Group CME.O and Intercontinental Exchange ICE.N to generate activity in contracts by providing constant bids and offers on the platform that counterparties can engage with.  Jiang Yan, chairman of INE\u2019s parent, the Shanghai Futures Exchange, said earlier this month in Shenzhen \u201cgradual improvement of relevant domestic laws and regulations\u201d would in time \u201cgreatly enhance\u201d Shanghai crude\u2019s recognition with international investors.  Outside China, the contract\u2019s denomination in yuan as part of Beijing\u2019s drive to push its currency into global markets has also scared off some traders as it introduces foreign exchange risk to the market.  To attract international participants, Stanley said a global exchange could \u201chave a look-a-like contract in U.S. dollars, thereby eliminating any FX risk.\u201d  Stanley pointed to iron ore futures, where Singapore Exchange (SGX) SGX1.SG mirrors a yuan-denominated contract from the Dalian Exchange in U.S. dollars.  Even without its flaws, some doubt whether Shanghai crude can break the dominance of Brent and WTI.  \u201cLiquidity is very hard to displace,\u201d said Martijn Rats, Global Oil Strategist at U.S. bank Morgan Stanley, adding that any new product would need some big advantages to sap liquidity from the most active futures contracts.

The U.S. oil trading market has developed enough liquidity to support new financial instruments to guard against unexpected shifts in local prices, due to pipeline outages or a sudden drop in exports that can ripple through regional crude markets.  Prior to the end of a four-decade crude export ban, most U.S. crude oil that was not used domestically was sent through Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures (WTI).  Now, buyers and sellers are increasingly looking at other points of delivery for pricing, particularly Houston, now that the country sends more than 3 million barrels of oil overseas daily.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got the regionalization of U.S. crude,\u201d said Owain Johnson, managing director for energy research and development at exchange operator CME Group Inc, which about a year ago launched crude futures contract deliverable at Houston.  He noted liquidity - the ease of trading a particular instrument due to more active market participants - is growing in contracts trading Houston-delivered oil and grades out of Louisiana\u2019s offshore terminal, among others.  The number of outstanding open contracts for the spread between WTI crude delivered to the growing export hub in Houston and to Cushing-delivered WTI futures rose to nearly 160,000 in July, a record, according to CME data.  The WTI Houston contract is based on assessments from price reporting agency Argus Media  \u201cThese grades didn\u2019t exist as derivatives in 2016 but these are now very liquid markets for hedging,\u201d Johnson said.  Hedges specific to oil sales from a particular locale started to spike in the United States in early 2018, according to CME.  Regional price variances have recently hurt producers due to pipeline bottlenecks that kept oil from getting to markets, increasing the need for different contracts to handle the risk.  Last year, prices in Midland, Texas, slumped to a four-year low at about $17 per barrel below WTI futures as surging production overwhelmed pipeline capacity. Producers who hedged using oil delivered to Cushing were hurt by that collapse in local prices which was not mirrored in WTI futures.  \u201cHedging WTI price risk often suited the risk profile well until regional bottlenecks began to emerge, which in turn exposed producers to risks that previously were not accounted for,\u201d said Michael Tran, managing director of energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York.  Open interest in the spread between Argus WTI Midland to WTI futures in September is currently about 130,000 lots, lower than the all-time highs near 180,000 contracts, but still far more than 2017, when it was less than 40,000 contracts.  Companies are taking advantage of new contracts to add to their hedging capacity. Permian producer Parsley Energy Inc and smaller rival shale producer QEP Resources Inc began hedging using WTI Houston basis swaps for a part of their 2019 production, filings showed.  The companies did not respond to requests for comment.  An oil basis swap is a derivative contract that fixes the price difference between two sales points for specified crude volumes over a particular time period. Several other shale producers already use basis swaps for the spread between WTI in Midland, Texas and WTI Cushing, regulatory filings show.  With a slate of new pipelines coming online in the United States thanks to the shale boom, more midstream companies are now using niche hedging strategies as well, dealers and analysts said.

The market operator had launched last December its cash-settled futures based on Platts price benchmarks for Russian wheat and Ukrainian corn.  The cash-settled wheat futures have attracted regular volume, in contrast with CME\u2019s illiquid Black Sea wheat contract with physical delivery dating back to 2012.  Options, for which the holder pays a price in order to have the right to buy or sell related futures at a particular level, are widely used in grain and other commodity markets to cover price risks.

The cash-settled wheat futures, based on Platts\u2019 Russian Wheat 12.5 percent protein FOB (free on board) Black Sea Deep Water daily price assessment, have open interest of over 22,000 lots, equivalent to 1.1 million tonnes, he said.  Russia is currently the world\u2019s biggest wheat exporter.  The derivatives have attracted both physical traders and financial investors, while geographically participants cover most of the world\u2019s regions, Kuijpers added.  The Ukrainian corn contract has attracted less activity, with open interest currently at around 500 lots.  CME has turned to cash-settled futures after struggling to replicate in Europe the success of its physically deliverable Chicago futures, which are a global benchmark for grain markets.  Like its illiquid Black Sea wheat contract from 2012, European Union wheat futures launched by CME in 2016 in a challenge to Euronext\u2019s established market have failed to take off.

Electronic trading between banks on the world\u2019s biggest platforms -- owned by Refinitiv, partly owned by Thomson Reuters and EBS, part of the CME Group, among others -- has fallen by 7% to $368 billion per day in 2019 from a similar survey three years ago.  This decline in trading has been driven by the growing trend of \u201cinternationalisation\u201d, where dealers temporarily warehouse risk arising from client trades on their books until it is offset against opposing client flow, reducing the need to use the broader market platforms.  The BIS, known as the central bankers\u2019 bank, noted these electronic inter-dealer brokerage systems, which are central to FX trading, now constitute only for a small portion of the turnover in the market even though they remain essential in price discovery.  BIS data showed banks reporting in the United Kingdom and the United States registered some of the largest declines in electronic trading on anonymous inter-dealer venues and also posted some of the highest internalisation ratios for cash trading.  London and New York hold the first and second spots in market share in global FX trading.  This trend has also been helped by a drop in currency market volatility to record lows. For example, trading ranges in the euro\/dollar last week, the world\u2019s most actively traded currency pair, was the narrowest in two decades.  The ability of the top banks to internalize client flows has also been helped by their ability to attract trading flows from customers via direct price streams and a pickup in automated trading. For example, Algorithmic trading on EBS, a major platform, has topped 75% in 2019 compared with nearly zero in 2004.  This trend of banks keeping a greater share of their trading flow on their internal systems has fuelled concentration of market share among a few very large banks, the BIS said.  \u201cThe falling share of inter-dealer trading has gone hand-in-hand with a handful of banks coming to dominate FX volumes,\u201d the BIS said.","476":"(Reuters) - The top U.S. commodities markets regulator warned exchanges and brokerages on Thursday that they should be prepared for volatility and possible negative pricing for certain contracts, nearly one month after U.S. oil futures plunged into negative territory for the first time in history.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Last month, the expiring U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures contract slumped to a minus $37.63 a barrel as panicked investors bailed out of positions upon realizing that many would be forced to take physical delivery of oil without a place to put the barrels.  Numerous funds and brokerages suffered losses due to their exposure. Funds, including exchange-traded funds, have since reduced holdings in near-term contracts and brokerages told customers they cannot open new positions when contracts are close to expiring.  The U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency overseeing futures and options trading, said in a letter dated Wednesday that exchange operators and brokerages need to protect markets from manipulation and potentially intervene to protect customers.  \u201cWe are issuing this advisory in the wake of unusually high volatility and negative pricing experienced in the May 2020 physically delivered WTI contract, and related reference contracts, on April 20,\u201d the CFTC said in its letter.  The U.S. WTI contract for June delivery expires on Tuesday. Holders of that contract are required to take delivery of oil at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub in the next month, but with demand low, financial firms holding the contract found few takers as they scrambled to unload positions.  The CFTC told exchanges they need rules to give them emergency authority to either liquidate or transfer open positions in a contract, or potentially suspend trading in a particular contract if needed.  \u201cIt\u2019s wise that they sent that letter, as I think there\u2019s a real chance for another flirtation with or breaking of that zero bound,\u201d said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.  In the wake of the selloff, numerous funds shifted their holdings out of nearer-dated futures contracts to avoid a repeat of April\u2019s turmoil, and several brokerages said they would not allow customers to open new positions in oil futures close to contract expiration.  Trading volumes have also shifted away from the front-month contract. For the first nine trading days in May, the second-month contract\u2019s volumes were 145% of the front-month. In the same time period for the first four months of the year, trading was concentrated in the expiring contract, as the second-month contract\u2019s volumes were just 34% of the front-month.  \u201cFirms are basically preparing for a replay of what happened. They\u2019re better prepared and they are taking steps to avoid a catastrophe again,\u201d said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. He said the chances of a second dip into negative territory were small.  Last month, CFTC Chairman Heath Tabert said the volatility in oil markets was due to fundamental issues and not a problem with financial markets. Storage has filled rapidly as the coronavirus pandemic took hold and cut worldwide fuel demand by 30%.  In the wake of the selloff, CME Group, the exchange operator for U.S. oil futures, said the markets worked as designed, even as markets traded into negative territory. CME declined to comment on Thursday.  The CFTC also said brokerages need to monitor customer accounts to make sure that they do not default on positions or fall below required levels of margin.

More than 3,000 one-month and three-month contracts based on the new benchmark interest rate traded in the launch, according to the CME.  Though that is well below volumes in the CME\u2019s other rate futures, trading on SOFR-based contracts has been expected to begin slowly as investors familiarize themselves with the new rate. The New York Federal Reserve only began publishing SOFR on April 3.  \u201cWe saw more than 3,000 contracts traded and very strong participation for a new interest rate contract,\u201d said Agha Mirza, CME\u2019s global head of interest rate products in Chicago. \u201cThis is a testament that market participants appreciate the importance of building a derivatives marketplace on the SOFR index.\u201d  The CME\u2019s launch of the contracts is part of a multi-year effort to move around $200 trillion in U.S.-dollar based derivatives and loans away from the use of the London interbank offered rate (Libor), which is what large banks charge each other for short-term loans. Cleared interest rate swaps based on SOFR are also slated for this year.  Regulators including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have warned that Libor could pose systemic risks in the event it stops being published due to the sheer size of markets based on the rate."}}
