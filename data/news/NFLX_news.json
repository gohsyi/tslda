FRANCISCO (Reuters) - For long-term shareholders of Netflix NFLX.O, the end of December marks an extremely rewarding decade.  FILE PHOTO: The Netflix series Money Heist is advertised at the booth of Netflix during Europe's leading digital games fair Gamescom, which showcases the latest trends of the computer gaming scene in Cologne, Germany, August 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Wolfgang Rattay  Shares of the video-streaming heavyweight have surged over 4,100% since the end of 2009, making it the S&P 500\u2019s top performer over the past 10 years. Analysts mostly recommend investors keep buying the shares, even as the Los Gatos, California, company faces a surge in competition and questions about whether it can maintain its rapid user growth.  (GRAPHIC: Top S&P 500 performers of the decade - )  (GRAPHIC: Current S&P 500 constituents' worst performers of the decade - )  DECADE\u2019S WORST LOSERS GRAPHIC  The dramatic rise of Netflix's business and share price established the company as part of the so-called FANG quartet of high-growth stocks - along with Facebook FB.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O and Google-owner Alphabet GOOGL.O - that captivated investors and accounted for much of Wall Street's rally in recent years. Netflix expanded its subscriber base from 12 million at the end of 2009 to 158 million last September.  But at the start of 2010, when mailing DVDs to customers was still a large chunk of Netflix\u2019s business, the average analyst recommendation for the company was \u201chold,\u201d making it one of the S&P 500 stocks least favored by analysts at that time.  As well as being the top overall performer across the decade, Netflix was the S&P 500\u2019s strongest annual performer in 2010, 2013 and 2015, gaining 219%, 298% and 134% in each of those years, respectively.  (GRAPHIC: Top S&P 500 performers by year - )  The only other S&P 500 component leading the index more than once on an annual basis over the decade was chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O, which surged 80% last year and is on track to gain 132% in 2019. Up over 340% since the end of 2009, AMD's recent surge marks a comeback after a downturn in personal computer sales in the first half of the decade had many investors questioning whether the chipmaker would survive at all in the shadow of semiconductor giant Intel INTC.O.  Under Chief Executive Lisa Su, who took over in 2014, AMD stopped losing money and is expected by analysts to expand its bottom line by over 40% in 2019, according to Refinitiv.  Following its stellar stock market performance, Netflix is now struggling with slowing subscriber growth, ballooning costs to produce content and new competition from Walt Disney DIS.N and other services. With Netflix up 24% in 2019 and falling short of the S&P 500's 28% gain, analysts on average now recommend buying its shares. The stock remains down 20% from its record high close in July 2018.  The S&P 500's second-strongest performer of the decade has been electronic bond trading system operator MarketAxess Holdings Inc MKTX.O, up over 2,600%, followed by medical equipment maker Abiomed ABMD.O, which has surged over 1,800%.  In ninth place is Ulta Beauty ULTA.O, which has flourished even as other shopping mall retailers struggled to fend off Amazon and is up 1,280% over the decade. Amazon AMZN.O clocks in as the decade's 11th-strongest S&P 500 performer, gaining 1,232%.  Investors buying the stocks most highly rated on average by analysts at the start of the decade, and holding them through 2019, mostly would have done well. But investors buying and holding the stocks least liked by analysts at the end of 2009 also would have fared well.  (GRAPHIC: Analysts' top picks at the start of the decade - )  Among current S&P 500 components, Incyte INCY.O, CMS Energy CMS.N, J M Smucker SJM.N, United Airlines UAL.O and Delta Air Lines DAL.N were the stocks with the highest aggregate analyst rating at the end of 2009, and of those, only J M Smucker underperformed the S&P 500's total return of over 250% during the decade, including dividends. The five stocks least liked by analysts at the start of the decade were Ameren AEE.N, Brown-Forman BFb.N, Apartment Investment and Management Co AIV.N, Hershey HSY.N and American International Group AIG.N, and of those, only AIG has underperformed the S&P 500.  As the decade nears its finish, just one stock in the S&P 500 has an average analyst rating of \"sell\": Franklin Resources BEN.N, the holding company that owns Franklin Templeton Investments. Eight analysts recommend selling Franklin Resources, while six are neutral and none recommend buying, according to Refinitiv data.","1":"May 24 (Reuters) - Telefonica:  * TO INTEGRATE NETFLIX INTO ITS TV AND VIDEO PLATFORMS IN LATIN AMERICA  * PLANS TO LAUNCH NETFLIX INTEGRATION IN SPAIN AT THE END OF 2018 Source text: bit.ly\/2IHKtA5 Further company coverage: (Gdynia Newsroom)","2":"NEW YORK\/SEOUL (Reuters) - A zombie drama, a TV series about a supernatural nurse and one about an antisocial children\u2019s book author helped turn South Korea into one of Netflix\u2019s biggest sources of growth in the international markets, a source familiar with the matter said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Netflix said 46% of its net new global paid customers in the third quarter came from the Asia Pacific region, where revenue rose 66% from last year, primarily Japan and South Korea, the company reported in a letter to investors on Tuesday.

It was not immediately clear exactly what will be discussed at the meeting.  The company is eager to demonstrate its big investments in the region as well as its role in making Korean pop culture popular more accessible outside of Korea.  Netflix\u2019s South Korean business has played a major role in third-quarter growth. The world\u2019s largest paid streaming video service now serves 3.3 million paid members in the region as of Sept. 30, the source said.  Overall, Netflix now serves more than 195 million paid subscribers.  The company has helped fuel and is fueled by the global popularity of the pop culture machine of South Korea. Since 2015, the world\u2019s largest subscription streaming video platform has invested nearly $700 million financing partnerships and co-productions, the source said.  Since late 2019, it has ramped up investments and landed multi-year content partnerships with Korea\u2019s major studios including CJ ENM\/Studio Dragon and JTBC for access to their Korean shows.  More than 70 Korean-made shows from local creators have been released as Netflix-branded originals around the world and are available in 31 subtitled languages and more than 20 dubbed languages.  In October, Netflix released the original documentary \u201cBlack Pink: Light Up the Sky\u201d about the highest charted female Korean act on the Billboard 100. The group\u2019s recent music video for \u201cHow You Like That\u201d broke an all-time YouTube record as the most watched video in a 24-hour period with 86.3 million views.  \u2018NETFLIX LAW\u2019  South Korea in May passed the revision to the country\u2019s telecommunications business act, dubbed as \u201cNetflix law,\u201d to require all content providers including foreign companies to share network cost burden with local internet service providers.  The revision came after Netflix in April sued South Korea's internet network operator SK Broadband, an affiliate of the country's top mobile carrier SK Telecom Co Ltd 017670.KS.  The two companies failed to reach an agreement on the U.S. streaming giant\u2019s use of SK Broadband\u2019s internet service without sharing network cost despite SK Broadband\u2019s expansion of network infrastructure to support Netflix\u2019s increasing traffic.  Netflix asked the Seoul Central District Court to rule that it is not obligated to pay additional fee.","3":"April 21 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc on Tuesday reported more paid subscribers than expected in the first quarter, as global lockdowns to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus forced people to stay at home and watch shows online including the wildly popular \u201cTiger King.\u201d  The streaming giant added 15.77 million paid subscribers globally during the quarter compared with analysts\u2019 estimates of nearly 8 million, according to research firm FactSet.","4":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc said on Tuesday it will release more than 70 movies this year to its U.S. customers across comedy, drama, family and other genres, a lineup that underscores the streaming service\u2019s growing prominence in the film business.  The Netflix slate includes crime thriller \u201cRed Notice\u201d starring Ryan Reynolds, Gal Gadot and Dwayne Johnson, one of six action movies, and zombie heist film \u201cArmy of the Dead\u201d from director Zack Snyder. The dozen comedies include \u201cDon\u2019t Look Up\u201d with an all-star cast of Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Tyler Perry, Meryl Streep and others.  All but four of the films will be available to Netflix customers in the more than 190 countries it serves. Ten of the movies are in languages other than English. Additional movies will be released in markets outside the United States.  Netflix is competing for viewers with a group of newer streaming services from Walt Disney Co, AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Apple Inc. Competition has intensified as the coronavirus pandemic has shuttered movie theaters and left home-bound audiences searching for entertainment.  The Netflix pace of releasing more than one film per week dwarfs that of other Hollywood studios.

Rege-Jean Page and Phoebe Dynevor are seen in an undated handout still from the Netflix series \"Bridgerton\". Netflix\/Handout via REUTERS  Shares of Netflix rose nearly 13% in extended trading as the financial milestone validated the company\u2019s strategy of going into debt to take on big Hollywood studios with a flood of its own programming in multiple languages.  The world\u2019s largest streaming service had raised $15 billion through debt in less than a decade. On Tuesday, the company said it expected free cash flow to break even in 2021, adding in a letter to shareholders, \u201cWe believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations.\u201d  Netflix said it will explore returning excess cash to shareholders via share buybacks.

Fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.19 missed analyst expectations of $1.39.  With the new customers, Netflix\u2019s worldwide membership reached 203.7 million. The company that pioneered streaming in 2007 added more subscribers in 2020 than in any other year, boosted by viewers who stayed home to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

Walt Disney Co in December unveiled a hefty slate of new programming for Disney+, while AT&T Inc\u2019s Warner Bros scrapped the traditional Hollywood playbook by announcing it would send all 2021 movies straight to HBO Max alongside theaters.

Forty-one percent joined from Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  For January through March, Netflix projected it would sign up 6 million more global subscribers, behind analyst expectations of roughly 8 million.

New shows like \u201cAltered Carbon\u201d and \u201cO Mecanismo\u201d helped Netflix smash analysts\u2019 subscriber estimates, and its better-than-expected second-quarter outlook soothed concerns about competition from Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc.

The stock is the top performer on the S&P 500 this year, gaining more than 60 percent.  \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a one-time thing,\u201d said Chaim Siegel, analyst at Elazar Advisors. \u201cIt\u2019s very similar to the results we saw last quarter. It\u2019s getting better.\u201d  Wall Street expected Netflix to add 6.5 million new subscribers, according to FactSet data. Netflix topped that and also said it would bring in 6.2 million more customers from April through June, 1 million more than analyst predictions.  Netflix says it will spend up to $8 billion on global TV shows and movies in 2018. As it has expanded to some 190 countries, investors accepted negative free cash flow in exchange for the potential of outsized growth in future years.  \u201cWe have big plans for content growth and you should expect that to continue,\u201d Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on a post-earnings webcast.  In the first three months of the year, Netflix boosted original programing by 85 percent from a year earlier to a record 483 hours, according to Cowen & Co analysts.  The slate included science fiction series \u201cAltered Carbon\u201d and Marvel action drama \u201cJessica Jones.\u201d  The Netflix logo is pictured on a television in this illustration photograph taken in Encinitas, California, U.S., January 18, 2017.

For the just-ended quarter, revenue grew 40 percent year-over-year to $3.7 billion, the fastest pace in the company\u2019s history. The average cost of a Netflix membership rose 14 percent during that time, and customer ranks swelled to 125 million.  \u201cSubscribers are accelerating even at higher pricing,\u201d BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said. \u201cContent spend is having a direct effect on its subscriber growth.\u201d  In a quarterly letter to shareholders, Netflix said it will \u201ccontinue to raise debt as needed to fund our increase in original content,\u201d adding that its debt levels were \u201cquite modest as a percentage of our enterprise value.\u201d  The company\u2019s market capitalization stands at $137.2 billion, more than double a year earlier.  But it faces growing competition as technology companies such as Apple and Amazon pour money into premium programing, international rivals jump into streaming and traditional media companies pursue digital customers.  Walt Disney Co will stop supplying new movies to Netflix starting next year and will start its own streaming service for families.  Investors have appeared bullish on the company\u2019s ability to add more members.

The company added 2.2 million paid subscribers globally during the quarter that ended Sept. 30, missing Wall Street's target of 3.4 million and its own forecast. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/3jhdq7e)  Earnings per share also landed below analyst expectations at $1.74. The consensus forecast was $2.14, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Shares of Netflix, one of the biggest gainers this year as people stayed home amid the pandemic, dropped nearly 6% to $494 in after-hours trading on Tuesday.  \u201cDomestic subscribers were nearly flat, which highlights Netflix\u2019s saturation in the U.S.,\u201d said Ross Benes, analyst with eMarketer. With domestic additions slowing, revenue growth will likely come from price increases, he said.

Netflix had warned investors that a sudden surge in new sign-ups would fade in the latter half of the year as COVID-19 restrictions eased. Netflix forecast in the fourth quarter it would bring in 6 million new subscribers around the globe, short of the 6.51 million that analysts expected.  The streaming video pioneer is trying to win new customers and fend off competition as viewers embrace online entertainment.

In recent months, major sports resumed play and nascent streaming services, including AT&T's HBO Max and Comcast Corp's CMCSA.O Peacock, offered audiences new options.  Netflix said its results reflected the fact that it saw such a big surge in customers early in the year.  \u201cWe continue to view quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in paid net adds as not that meaningful in the context of the long run adoption of internet entertainment, which we believe is still early and should provide us with many years of strong future growth as we continue to improve our service,\u201d the company said.  Netflix officials noted the company had pulled in more subscribers in the first nine months of 2020 than in all of 2019. It ended the third quarter with 195.2 million global streaming customers.  \u201cNext time we get together, we should be over 200 million members, completing a year of 34 million (additions),\u201d an annual record, Co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings said in an analyst interview.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The world\u2019s biggest video streaming platform by paid customers, Netflix told Reuters more than a million of its nearly 200 million subscribers around the world are in Southeast Asia, home to around 655 million people. But the market is ripe for rapid growth, analysts say, with the Disney+ Hotstar launch in Indonesia next month set to become a key battleground.  \u201cWhat we see in Southeast Asia is that it\u2019s a very mobile-centric market\u201d, Netflix director for product innovation Ajay Arora told Reuters in a recent interview. That\u2019s led the company to push cheaper mobile plans and adapt its product to fit lower-end smartphones, Arora said.  Southeast Asia is estimated to have generated $600 million in overall subscription music and video revenue in 2019, according to a study by Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain & Co - but that\u2019s set to explode to an annual $3 billion by 2025, the study said.  Starting with India in August 2019, Netflix has now launched mobile-only plans in Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia - all priced at below $5 a month. That\u2019s a departure for Netflix, which has held firm on pricing in Western markets.  Repeated coronavirus lockdowns across Southeast Asia have also increased the appetite for content streaming at home across the region.  A Netflix spokeswoman told Reuters that the firm \u201chas well over 1 million subscribers in multiple Southeast Asian countries\u201d, but declined to provide details.  Consultancy Media Partners Asia estimates that Southeast Asia video streaming service subscribers will reach 14.7 million in all by the end of 2020.  Netflix executive Arora said his firm is also working to expand its payment options in countries with low credit and debit card penetration. In markets like the Philippines, subscribers can pay for Netflix through their mobile telephone plans, or by purchasing prepaid Netflix cards at convenience stores.  The company faces competition in the region not just from Disney+, a distant, but ambitious, global no. 2 in the industry. Other regional rivals include Hong Kong video service Viu, popular for its Korean dramas, as well as Chinese tech giant Tencent\u2019s WeTV, which in June bought the assets of Malaysian streaming platform Iflix.  Disney+ is currently in the middle of a hiring spree across the region and is expected to launch broadly in the coming months jointly with its Indian streaming platform Hotstar. Disney\u2019s family and superhero movies have proven consistent hits in Southeast Asia.  In Indonesia, the world\u2019s fourth most populous country with 270 million people, Disney+ said last week it would start operating in September in partnership with state-owned telco Telkomsel with a catalogue that will include more than 300 local movies.  Bracing for the challenge, Netflix Southeast Asia content lead Myleeta Aga told Reuters that the firm, which announced two new original Indonesian productions earlier last Thursday, places high importance on the region and will continue to ramp up local content offerings. She said Netflix expects to start filming projects in Indonesia and Thailand soon.","35":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s production company on Friday announced six new projects in development for Netflix Inc, including a love story with a supernatural twist and a young adult thriller.

REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni  A cottage industry of companies has sprung up to fill that vacuum. Firms like Apptopia, Sensor Tower and App Annie, born years ago to track how many people download mobile apps, are now playing a bigger role in the streaming war that kicks into gear this year as AT&T Inc\u2019s WarnerMedia and Comcast Corp-owned NBCUniversal launch new services.  These firms sell mobile download data they arrive at by applying algorithmic magic to publicly available data and data from other apps. The process is propriety, they say, and opaque to outsiders.  The resulting figures - which are approximations of mobile downloads, not the new subscribers the companies disclose - do not correlate exactly with subscriber growth, but are influential.  Third-party data is widely reported in the press, including in Reuters stories. Bloomberg offers Apptopia\u2019s mobile data to its clients. The data is also cited in research from Wall Street firms including Credit Suisse, Bank of America and Wells Fargo - sometimes as a worthwhile indication of performance, and other times dismissively.  The data moves markets: On Nov. 26, shortly after Apptopia released data indicating that Disney+ was averaging nearly a million new subscribers a day \u2013 a report that was covered widely in the press \u2013 Disney shares rose 2.3% to $153.43, setting a new record high.  To survey how often these firms get it right, Reuters reviewed eight quarters of data from Netflix, and the same amount of data from two of the third-party app measurement firms. It found that Sensor Tower\u2019s past eight quarters\u2019 of Netflix mobile download data has directionally if not precisely mirrored Netflix global paid membership growth. Apptopia download data mirrored it directionally in all but two quarters.  (Can app download data predict Netflix user growth? Click graphic )  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Even so, the data is controversial: critics say these firms do a poor job of tracking how many people drop a streaming service, and as such, should not be viewed as a proxy for growth.  \u201cIf we had based our conclusions on app download data, we\u2019d be very incorrect about what Netflix is doing and everything in any given quarter,\u201d said MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson, who said his firm had used Apptopia and Sensor Tower, but no longer does so.  Netflix did not respond to requests for comment. Disney and App Annie declined to comment.  Executives from Sensor Tower and Apptopia emphasize that the data reflects trends, not precise growth.  \u201cThe reason people like and trust the mobile data is that mobile gets the most screen time -- it\u2019s indicative of how people are living their lives,\u201d says Adam Blacker, a vice president at Apptopia. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is nailing the trends and the percentage swings.\u201d  Recent quarters of Netflix mobile download data from Apptopia and Sensor Tower, while directionally mostly correct, have been off in notable ways. Apptopia recorded negative download growth for Netflix in the second and fourth quarters of 2019 -- compared to the 22% and 20% global paid membership growth the company reported, respectively. In the third quarter of 2019, Apptopia reported single-digit growth compared with an increase of 21% reported by Netflix.  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be right 100% of the time,\u201d says Blacker about those quarters. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tell you to trade on download data.\u201d  Sensor Tower reported single-digit global mobile app install growth for Netflix in the second and fourth quarters of 2019, compared with growth of 22% and 20%, respectively, reported by Netflix.  \u201cWe\u2019re only looking at mobile,\u201d said Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower. \u201cWe only capture that first time install - it could be someone downloading on their phone; could be someone who\u2019s been a Netflix subscriber for a while but never put it on their phone.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  At an event in Rome to present the accord, the company behind hit shows \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cStranger Things\u201d also announced it would open offices and pay tax in Italy, in a boost to local authorities which have pursued big international tech companies on charges of dodging tax.  The partnership comes amid heightened competition in the crowded European television market which has been squeezed by the growing popularity of on-demand streaming services like Netflix.  The streaming group, in turn, is stepping up strategic tie-ups in Europe to tackle a wave of new rivals, such as Disney DIS.N and Apple APPL.O. Last month it signed a deal with France's Canal+ VIV.PA to add Netflix subscriptions to TV bundles.  Under the deal, Netflix and Mediaset, which is controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, will co-finance seven movies shot in Italy by independent local filmmakers.  The movies will be available worldwide on Netflix from next year. Mediaset will broadcast the Netflix-branded movies on its free-to-air channels in Italy 12 months later.  \u201cGreat stories can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere,\u201d Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said.  REGULAR TAXPAYER  The first five films include \u201cThe Divine Ponytail\u201d, a biopic on Italian soccer legend Roberto Baggio, \u201cCaught by a wave\u201d, a teenage romance set in Sicily and \u201cThe last paradise\u201d, the real life story of a 1950s farmer caught between social reform ideals and his love for a landowner\u2019s daughter.  \u201cAlliances among large broadcasters focusing on original productions are one of the most effective answers to changes in the market,\u201d Mediaset head of content Alessandro Salem said.  Netflix has more than 2 million subscribers in Italy and will invest some 200 million euros in the next two years in Italian productions, though it has no plans to open studios in the near future, Reed said.  Netflix entered the Italian market in 2015.  Reed said opening offices in Italy will turn the company into a regular taxpayer in the country.  The move comes amid growing pressure from tax authorities on big tech companies, who they accuse of not paying enough tax.  Italian Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri on Tuesday called for \u201cprofits to be taxed where they are made\u201d and said Rome would implement a tax on some Internet transactions next year.  A source told Reuters last week Italian prosecutors had opened an investigation into alleged tax evasion targeting Netflix following checks by tax authorities. Netflix said it was working with authorities and had paid all taxes due in Italy and other countries.","41":"FILE PHOTO: A sign of Chinese video-streaming platform iQiyi Inc is pictured at the Beijing International Cultural and Creative Industry Expo, in Beijing, China May 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Stringer\/File Photo  (This June 24 story corrects to add company clarification that iQiyi\u2019s partnership with Netflix has ended, not ongoing. Removes quote which suggested that partnership was ongoing.)  BEIJING (Reuters) - iQiyi, China\u2019s answer to Netflix, intends to push harder into overseas markets such as North America and Japan after the video-streaming service hit a milestone of 100 million paying subscribers this month, a senior executive said on Monday.  The company, which has been locked in a cash-burning fight with Tencent\u2019s video site and Alibaba-backed Youku Tudou in China, wants to distribute more of its self-produced content in North America, Singapore, South Korea and Japan, where they were seeing growing interest in Chinese-language shows, iQiyi\u2019s President of Membership and Overseas Business, Yang Xianghua, told Reuters in an interview.  \u201cGiven more time, I think we can have a lot of opportunities in other markets globally,\u201d he said.  The company, which produces original TV programs, reality shows, and online movies, announced on Saturday that it had reached the 100 million paid subscriber mark, which it attributed to its focus on acquiring viewers among the country\u2019s elderly and rural residents.  In comparison, Tencent Video said in May that it had 89 million paying subscribers respectively while Netflix Inc in January said it had over 139 million paid memberships in over 190 countries.  iQiyi currently distributes its content overseas through tie-ups with local streaming sites.  A bigger push overseas could eventually see iQiyi go head-to-head with Netflix, with which it signed a licensing deal in 2017.  Under that partnership, which iQiyi said had expired in September last year, Netflix had streamed some of its content through iQiyi\u2019s site.","42":"NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The University of Notre Dame bought streaming company Netflix Inc\u2019s stock, slashed its holdings in Microsoft Corp as well as the Class C shares of Alphabet Inc, and sold its stake in Open Text Corp, Barron\u2019s reported on Sunday, citing the university\u2019s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The logo of Bayer AG is pictured at the Bayer Healthcare subgroup production plant in Wuppertal, Germany February 24, 2014. REUTERS\/Ina Fassbender\/File Photo  The company, in a statement released Thursday night, said the documentary \u201cThe Bleeding Edge,\u201d which debuted on the streaming site on Friday, lacks scientific support and cherry-picked facts to present an inaccurate and misleading picture of Bayer\u2019s permanent birth control device Essure, one of the products spotlighted in the film.  \u201cThis does a disservice to the thousands of women who rely on Essure for their reproductive health, as it may encourage them to pursue risky and unnecessary surgery to remove the device,\u201d Bayer said.  Nexflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Bayer last week announced it would phase out Essure in the United States after discontinuing sales elsewhere in 2017, a move it said was not related to safety concerns. Bayer said studies overwhelmingly showed Essure to be safe.  A small metal coil inserted into a woman\u2019s fallopian tubes, Essure triggers scarring to permanently prevent pregnancy.  Bayer currently faces over 16,000 U.S. lawsuits related to Essure from women who claim the implants caused injuries like excessive bleeding, abdominal pain and allergic reactions.  The documentary features several women who say they were injured by Essure and accuse Bayer of having concealed its knowledge about potential risks.  The documentary also focuses on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s metal-on-metal hip and pelvic mesh implants, saying the company knew the products to be unsafe but proceeded to market them anyway.  J&J did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company in the past has said it stands by the safety of both devices, adding that surgeons are properly informed about potential complications.  The J&J devices featured in the documentary were cleared by the FDA under less stringent procedures than its formal approval process, exempting manufacturers from having to submit clinical data on device safety.  Essure was approved in 2002 following the FDA\u2019s most stringent device review process, but the documentary said Bayer evaded critical safety questions at the time.  The FDA in a statement said it has not yet seen the documentary but that it strives to allow devices with favorable benefit-risk profiles to be marketed.  \u201cOften the true benefit-risk profile of a device cannot be fully understood until it can be evaluated when used in routine clinical practice,\u201d the FDA said, adding that it uses postmarket data to monitor the safety and effectiveness of devices.  The agency is currently monitoring Essure in postmarket studies.","45":"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Netflix Inc unveiled a plan on Thursday to make 17 more original productions in Asia including Thai and Chinese language shows, as the U.S. firm seeks to attract new international users through more local content.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The plan, which includes nine productions in India and five anime series, should help ease concern that the video streaming pioneer is running out of space to expand in developed markets.  Netflix reported bumper quarterly earnings last month as it exceeded forecasts in both the U.S. and international markets, with the bulk of new subscribers coming from outside the United States where the company has been investing aggressively.  \u201cMore than half of Asian content hours viewed on Netflix this year are viewed outside the region,\u201d Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, said when unveiling the plan at the firm\u2019s content showcase event in Singapore.  \u201cSo we have confidence that our upcoming slate of Asian productions will find fans in their home countries and abroad.\u201d  Netflix has earmarked $8 billion for content this year, and had spent $6.9 billion as at the end of its third quarter.  On Thursday, the company said the new productions will include anime series such as Trese, based on a Philippine graphic novel of the same name, and Pacific Rim, an adventure story about two siblings searching for their missing parents.  Netflix will make two Thai language originals including Shimmers, a drama series about five teenagers at an isolated school in northern Thailand. It will also broadcast Triad Princess, a Chinese-language original from Taiwan in which the protagonist seeks independence in defiance of her Triad father.  The new titles build on Netflix\u2019s recent forays into Asian productions, including India\u2019s Sacred Games, Japanese anime series DEVILMAN crybaby, and variety comedy BUSTED! in South Korea.  In Asia, led by India, Netflix has won fans among a young, tech-savvy middle class. Chief Executive Reed Hastings has said India could deliver the service\u2019s next 100 million subscribers.  The company will announce details of nine projects from the country on Friday.  Netflix scored a hit in India with Mumbai-based crime thriller Sacred Games. However, the Bollywood studio that produced the show disbanded last month after sexual harassment allegations against one of its partners, Vikas Bahl, and the show\u2019s lead writer, Varun Grover. Both men have denied the allegations.  Netflix later backed the series for a second season.  The firm had 137 million subscribers to its movie and TV streaming service worldwide as of September-end. It began releasing original English-language programming nearly six years ago and has since expanded into other languages.","46":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc said on Wednesday it was totally pulling out of the Cannes Film Festival next month after organizers banned the streaming platform\u2019s films from competition for its refusal to release them in cinemas.  FILE PHOTO: An illustration photo shows the logo of Netflix the American provider of on-demand Internet streaming media in Paris September 15, 2014. REUTERS\/Gonzalo Fuentes  Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos told Hollywood trade publication Variety in an interview it was pointless to show at Cannes after the festival rule change.  Cannes festival director Thierry Fremaux said last month that Netflix had refused to give its movies theatrical distribution in France and would therefore be banned from competition at the 12-day festival. However, Thierry said Netflix could show movies outside competition.  Netflix will not participate as a non-competitor, Sarandos told Variety. \u201cI don\u2019t think there would be any reason to go out of competition. The rule was implicitly about Netflix, and Thierry made it explicitly about Netflix when he announced the rule.\u201d  \u201cWe want our films to be on fair ground with every other filmmaker,\u201d Sarandos added. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk in us going in this way and having our films and filmmakers treated disrespectfully at the festival. They\u2019ve set the tone. I don\u2019t think it would be good for us to be there.\u201d  Netflix plans to release 80 original films in 2018 to its 109 million streaming customers around the world.  The company has released a few films, like fantasy thriller \u201cBright,\u201d starring Will Smith, in a small number of theaters. But most major chains have refused to show Netflix movies because it releases them at the same time online. Movies from traditional studios typically run exclusively in cinemas for about three months.  Sarandos said he personally would not attend the May 8-19 festival in the French Riviera, but said Netflix executives would be there looking at films to acquire.  Netflix said it had nothing to add to Sarandos\u2019 comments to Variety.  The annual festival, which began as an art house showcase more than 70 years ago, has increasingly attracted more commercial movies and top celebrities to its red carpets.  Cannes organizers announced last week that the latest \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story\u201d would get its world premiere at the festival on May 15 ahead of its worldwide rollout on May 23.  \u201cFilm festivals are to help films get discovered so they can get distribution,\u201d Sarandos told Variety. \u201cUnder those rules, we could not release our films day-and-date to the world like we\u2019ve released nearly 100 films over the last couple of years.\u201d  Netflix won five Oscar nominations earlier this year for its period racial drama \u201cMudbound,\u201d while its film \u201cIcarus\u201d about Russian sports doping won best documentary.","47":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Satanic Temple sued Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Warner Bros Entertainment on Thursday, seeking more than $50 million for their alleged unauthorized use of a statue of the goat-headed deity Baphomet in the series \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.\"  Slideshow ( 2 images )  In a complaint filed with the U.S. District Court, the plaintiff, whose stated mission includes encouraging benevolence and empathy among people rejecting tyrannical authority, accused the defendants of copyright infringement, trademark violations and injury to its reputation.  Netflix referred a request for comment to Warner Bros, a unit of AT&T Inc T.N. Warner Bros spokesman Paul McGuire said that company does not discuss pending litigation.

In its complaint, The Satanic Temple also objected that the evil antagonists in \u201cSabrina\u201d were depicted in a manner \u201cin stark contrast to TST\u2019s tenets and beliefs.\u201d  The lawsuit also seeks the exclusion or digital removal of the plaintiff\u2019s statue from \u201cSabrina\u201d episodes.  \u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d is based on the comic book series with the same name from Archie Comics.

The film, examining themes of economic dislocation and clashing cultures, traces the experience of workers in Moraine, Ohio, who lost their jobs at a shuttered General Motors factory, only to be rehired six years later after the facility was converted into a Chinese-owned automotive glass plant.  \u201cOur film is from Ohio and China ... but it really could be from anywhere that people put on a uniform, punch a clock, try to make their families have a better life,\u201d Reichert said in accepting the award.  \u201cWorking people have it harder and harder these days, and we believe that things will get better when workers of the world unite,\u201d she added, evoking the famed Marxist rallying cry from \u201cThe Communist Manifesto.\u201d  Neither of the Obamas attended Sunday\u2019s ceremony, but Bognar mentioned Higher Ground Productions in his thank-yous from the stage.

The purchase of Regency Outdoor Advertising, if successful, would be the largest yet for the fast-growing Silicon Valley streaming video company, which has a studio in Hollywood and is now one of the world\u2019s biggest film and TV producers.  Netflix\u2019s motivation was not immediately clear, but it could save money over time with the deal, according to industry analysts, as it ramps up spending on marketing for its original shows and movies to $2 billion this year. Netflix used Regency Outdoor billboards to promote its \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown\u201d drama series.  A billboard ad on Los Angeles\u2019s Sunset Strip can cost $140,000 per month, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer.  \u201cThis is a smart move for Netflix because it is a very important viewing market,\u201d Lowenthal said. \u201cLos Angeles matters to the people in the industry.\u201d  Tech firms Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Hulu and Facebook Inc FB.O and traditional media companies such as Walt Disney Co DIS.N are all vying with Netflix to win subscribers.  Netflix is just one of the bidders for Los Angeles-based Regency Outdoor and there is no certainty that its offer will prevail, the sources said this week, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Netflix declined to comment. Its shares were close to unchanged in a slightly lower market. Regency Outdoor did not respond to a request for comment.  ANALOG ADS, DIGITAL CONTENT  The world\u2019s leading streaming media company still uses physical advertising space such as billboards to promote its shows. Billboards are holding their own compared to other forms of traditional advertising such as ads in newspapers or TV that are easy to skip.  Regency Outdoor, owned by brothers Drake and Brian Kennedy, owns billboards on Sunset Strip, a portion of Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles known for its live music and night clubs and filled with splashy billboards promoting upcoming TV shows and movies.  It also has billboards at Los Angeles International Airport, on major freeways, near the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus, and close to the Los Angeles Angels baseball stadium, according to the company\u2019s website.  Netflix said in a letter to shareholders earlier this year that its marketing spending was growing \u201ca little faster\u201d than its revenue.  As a result of the bigger marketing expenditure, Netflix\u2019s expenses per subscriber will jump around 25 percent to $16 per subscriber, up from $13 per subscriber, according to a recent MoffettNathanson report. The company reported it had 117.6 million worldwide streaming subscribers at the end of 2017, more than any direct competitor.  \u201cAs the marketplace for original content becomes more crowded, Netflix is turning up the volume to promote the increasing number of Netflix originals,\u201d Michael Nathanson, a MoffettNathanson analyst, wrote in the research note.  Netflix\u2019s first known acquisition was last year\u2019s purchase of comic book publisher Millarworld for an undisclosed sum.","50":"* Futures up: Dow 0.61 pct, S&P 0.51 pct, Nasdaq 0.51 pct  April 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Tuesday as strong earnings from Netflix, Johnson & Johnson and UnitedHealth boosted optimism over what is expected to be the strongest earnings season in seven years.

On the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is down about 0.6 percent so far this year, health stocks led the gainers.  UnitedHealth rose 1.78 percent after the largest U.S. health insurer raised its earnings forecast and posted results that beat Wall Street estimates.  J&J rose 0.94 percent after reporting a 12.6 percent rise in sales. Goldman Sachs shares rose 0.4 percent after the investment bank reported 27 percent surge in profit.  The results will add to optimism about first-quarter earnings growth, which is expected to be the strongest in seven years. Analysts expect S&P companies\u2019 profit rose 18.6 percent in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Investors have shifted their focus from geopolitical and trade concerns, which have roiled the markets in the recent months.  However, U.S.-China trade issues continue to simmer. China moved to slap a hefty temporary deposit on imports of U.S. sorghum in a preliminary antidumping ruling. Archer Daniel , a top seller of U.S. sorghum into China, was down 0.9 percent.  The move came a day after the United States banned American companies from selling parts and software to China\u2019s ZTE Corp for seven years.  A U.S.-led attack on Syria over the weekend has so far not prompted any military retaliation from Russia, easing fears over the conflict escalating.  Tesla shares fell 0.84 percent after the electric car maker temporarily suspended its Model 3 assembly line, in what it said was a planned production pause.  Data on U.S. homebuilding and industrial production are expected ahead of the opening bell.

The decision to make some content free on YouTube is a rare exception to Netflix\u2019s marketing strategy, which otherwise charges a monthly subscription fee from users to avail its services.

The Pop cable network, owned by ViacomCBS Inc, took the top comedy prize for offbeat series \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d which swept comedy categories to collect nine awards overall.  Winning the highest honors in television bestows a mark of prestige that networks can tout in their marketing to attract audiences in a crowded entertainment landscape. AT&T, Walt Disney Co, Apple and others have launched streaming video services to compete with online video pioneer Netflix.  HBO had long dominated the Emmys with hits such as \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cSex and the City\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Before Sunday, it was the most honored network for 17 of the past 18 years.

Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google logos are seen in this combination photo from Reuters files. REUTERS\/File Photos  After dumping shares of Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc - the FAANG components - prominent hedge fund managers including Tiger Global Management LLC have moved back into the popular group.  Tiger, managed by Chase Coleman, boosted its Facebook stake by 64.5% to 8.8 million class A shares during the first quarter, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It increased its stake in streaming company Netflix by 42.8% to 2.1 million shares. Soros Fund Management LLC opened a new stake in Netflix, holding 50,000 shares, at the end of March.  T. Rowe Price also added Facebook shares during the first quarter, increasing its stake by 19% to 107.9 million shares, as of the end of first quarter.  Netflix shares gained 2.7% to close at $354.99 and Facebook gained 3.1% to close at $186.27.  FAANG\u2019s return to vogue in 2019 has mostly outpaced the broader market\u2019s recovery, with Netflix surging 33% year to date, despite slowing user expansion and the threat of Walt Disney Co\u2019s upcoming video streaming service. Facebook has surged more than 40% in 2019 as investors bet that regulatory threats and calls to break up the world\u2019s largest social network will not endanger its meteoric growth in ad sales.  High-flying FAANG stocks came back to earth late last year amid fears that a decade-old bull market was fading.  \u201cFacebook\u2019s stock price has been hammered on the back of recent controversies, making what was already a very attractive return outlook for the stock even brighter,\u201d Paul Greene, portfolio manager of the T.

Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc said it owned $860.6 million of Amazon shares at the end of March, after the billionaire earlier this month admitted to having underestimated the online retailer and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos.  Buffett, who told CNBC in early May that Berkshire had bought Amazon shares for the first time, detailed the stake in Wednesday\u2019s 13F filing, revealing that Berkshire took a stake in the first quarter totaling 483,300 shares.  Buffett had told CNBC that the Amazon investment was made by one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, and said he had been \u201can idiot\u201d for not investing in Amazon himself.

Shares in the company fell 11% in early trade, as investors worried over lower-than-expected global growth and signs of trouble in its U.S. base.  Six brokerages cut their share price targets to reflect the dip in the shares, but there were no cuts to their ratings on the stock, still seen by a majority of Wall Street firms as a high-potential growth business and a clear \u201cbuy\u201d.  The company added just 2.83 million international paid streaming subscribers, compared with street expectations of 4.8 million. Brokers Cowen & Co calculated it had missed expectations for second-quarter subscriber numbers three times in the last four years.  \u201cThe subscriber miss wasn\u2019t unprecedented, though the international miss magnitude was greater than normal,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analysts said.  \u201cBut Q2 results do highlight the importance of a strong content slate and at least raise the question of whether NFLX needs to be more restrained with price increase pacing.\u201d  Netflix, which has 151.6 million customers, raised prices in Britain, Switzerland, Greece and Western Europe in the quarter.  Morningstar analysts said the company had conditioned users to expect strong original content every quarter and when the slate is weak or less known, the ability to drive marginal subscribers to join or renew becomes harder, especially when prices are rising.  The company began the third quarter with the release of its 1980s-set smash-hit \u201cStranger Things\u201d and will follow it with new seasons of \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d and \u201cThe Crown\u201d as well as hotly-awaited Martin Scorsese movie \u201cThe Irishman\u201d.  \u201cWe would note Netflix misses have been followed by strong quarters, and, along those lines, we expect Netflix\u2019s very strong 2H slate will lead to a rebound in sub growth,\u201d Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a client note.  The company forecast it would gain 7 million subscribers globally in the third quarter, when it will also launch new seasons of hit Spanish-language series \u201cLa Casa de Papel\u201d and the second season of Indian series \u201cSacred Games.\u201d  Netflix also laid out an extensive expansion plan in India, including 5 new originals, a prequel series to India\u2019s epic fantasy franchise \u201cBaahubali\u201d and rolling out a lower-priced mobile-only plan within the next three months.

FILE PHOTO: A man looks at his phone as he passes by a screen advertising Walt Disney's streaming service Disney+ in New York City, U.S., November 12, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Disney\u2019s control of Hotstar, which it acquired through the $71 billion purchase of Twenty-First Century Fox in 2019, gives Disney+\u2019s entrance into the Indian market in partnership with Hotstar hundreds of millions of potential subscribers it can attract.  Hotstar reported 300 million monthly active users last year. Most of these are users of the free, advertising-supported service and Disney has said it is aiming to convert many of these users into paying subscribers.  Disney could use the help as the streaming video war is waged on the global stage this year against rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc. India is widely viewed as one of the biggest source of new subscribers.  Hotstar\u2019s paid service includes shows from a spectrum of international programmers including AT&T Inc\u2019s HBO, whose offerings include \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cChernobyl\u201d as well as popular live sports content like Premier League soccer.  Disney+ Hotstar, will have two tiers of pricing where the premium variant will include its original programming like \u201cStar Wars\u201d TV series \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d and \u201cWandaVision\u201d and \u201cLoki\u201d from Marvel.  \u201cWe see this as a great opportunity to use the proven platform of Hotstar to launch the new Disney+ service in one of the most populous countries and fastest-growing economies in the world.\u201d Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in an earnings call on Tuesday.  India\u2019s nearly half a billion internet users, according to research firm Nielsen, have attracted the interest of big American streaming video companies Netflix and Amazon Prime. Both have invested in creating local programming to lure subscribers.  To better compete in this market, Netflix launched a lower cost mobile plan to lure subscribers, the first time it has done so in any market.  \u201cIndia is a key market for Disney & Iger internationally given the hunger for streaming content and the demand potential. That said, Netflix and Amazon have built strong local content. ... We believe 10 million to 15 million subs in 2 years would be an initial success story,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.  While the company did not disclose details on pricing, Disney+ has hovered on the lower end among streaming platforms in the United States and is expected to continue the trend. \u201cThey (Disney) are pretty value-priced, even in the U.S.,\u201d said Jehil Thakkar, Partner, Deloitte India.  Hotstar\u2019s paid services in India range from about 40 cents per month to $4.20. Netflix costs under $3 for a mobile-only plan and as high as around $11. Amazon Prime costs about $1.80 per month.","62":"July 17 (Reuters) - Shares of Netflix Inc fell 13 percent on Tuesday after it reported a surprise shortfall in subscriber additions for a second quarter marked by the lack of a blockbuster new show and the soccer World Cup.  While Wall Street remains overwhelmingly positive on Netflix and its role in video streaming globally, the numbers did raise question marks over future growth and six brokerages cut their price targets on the company\u2019s shares.  \u201cThe quarter is a reminder that Netflix\u2019s cadence of net adds is not linear, but lumpy in nature,\u201d said Justin Patterson, an analyst with Raymond James and Associates in San Francisco, while pointing to the absence of a new hit series as a driver.  \u201cThe company had lots of new content during the quarter; what it did not have was a major new breakout series.\u201d  Riding on the success of its original shows such as \u201c13 Reasons Why,\u201d \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d Netflix had beaten subscriber growth expectations in seven out of last 10 quarters.  That has driven a doubling of its share price in the last year, raising its value to within sight of $200 billion as of Monday\u2019s close.  What is not clear is where the hurdles to that unbroken run of growth will come from, be it stronger competition from Amazon Prime or the changes in control of major film and TV franchises heralded by Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp\u2019s bid for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc .  Netflix added 5.15 million customers from April through June, 1 million fewer than forecasts from Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S and down from 7.41 million in the first quarter.  \u201cWhile subscriber weakness is obviously an issue, the company\u2019s inability to explain it satisfactorily could weigh on the stock over the coming quarter,\u201d Barclays analysts said.  Still, there was only one outright cut in a trading recommendation on the stock - by Deutsche Bank to hold from buy - and two others actually upped their recommendations. At least three raised their price targets.  \u201cNetflix has faced hurdles before and this Q2 report won\u2019t be the last,\u201d PiperJaffray analyst Michael Olson wrote.  \u201cThe long term potential is too great for us to suggest anything other than buying (the shares),\u201d he added, listing a just 15 percent share of internet households outside China as a huge potential market.  Olson and several others pointed to the World Cup as a possible distraction in the quarter that might have encouraged subscribers to hold off or freeze subscriptions for a month.  The 2018 soccer tournament that is among the most-watched TV events started on June 14 and has just finished.  \u201cNetflix is in a business that varies by quarter anyway and perhaps the company shouldn\u2019t have gotten too enamored with the crazy success of the last two quarters which was invigorating but not sustainable,\u201d Forrester analyst James McQuivey said.

The world\u2019s largest streaming media service has also cut traffic on networks in Europe to help internet service providers (ISPs) experiencing a surge in usage.  Israeli ISPs have reported an average increase of up to 30% in traffic congestion since the outbreak began, and many Israelis have taken to social media to complain of a slowdown in Internet speeds, prompting the telecoms regulator to ask Netflix to lower broadcasting bit rates.  Netflix, which had more than 42 million subscribers in Europe, Africa and the Middle East in the first quarter, agreed to comply and will make adjustments gradually over the next week, the Communications Ministry said.  \u201cGiven the extraordinary challenges raised by the coronavirus, we have decided to begin reducing bit rates across all our streams in Israel for 30 days. We estimate that this will reduce Netflix traffic on Israeli networks by around 25% while also ensuring a good quality service,\u201d Netflix said.  In Europe, Netflix is removing its highest bandwidth within each resolution category -- Ultra High Definition (UHD), High Definition (HD) and Standard Definition (SD) -- for 30 days to help preserve the smooth functioning of the Internet during the coronavirus outbreak.  It said that in response to a request from the European Union last week, it tested and developed a way to reduce Netflix\u2019s traffic by 25% while maintaining the full range of video resolutions.  Netflix said it would continue to adhere with normal procedures for all other networks \u201cuntil and unless they experience issues of their own\u201d.","66":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - AT&T Inc\u2019s HBO network triumphed at Sunday\u2019s Emmy Awards with 30 wins, including best drama \u201cSuccession\u201d and limited series \u201cWatchmen,\u201d while Apple Inc took home its first award for the iPhone maker\u2019s dive into streaming television.

The Pop cable network, owned by ViacomCBS Inc, took the top comedy prize for offbeat series \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d which swept comedy categories to collect nine awards overall.  Winning the highest honors in television bestows a mark of prestige that networks can tout in their marketing to attract audiences in a crowded entertainment landscape. AT&T, Walt Disney Co, Apple and others have launched streaming video services to compete with online video pioneer Netflix.  HBO had long dominated the Emmys with hits such as \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cSex and the City\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Before Sunday, it was the most honored network for 17 of the past 18 years. The exception was in 2018, when Netflix and HBO tied in Emmy wins.  This year, HBO\u2019s alternative-reality drama \u201cWatchmen\u201d topped all shows with 11 awards, while the network\u2019s media dynasty tale \u201cSuccession\u201d earned seven.  The accolades were especially gratifying following questions about what HBO would do once megahit \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d ended in 2019, Casey Bloys, HBO programming president, said in an interview.  \u201cThis was a really nice way to answer that question,\u201d he said.  Bloys also said the network succeeded by staying aware of growing competition \u201cbut not distracted by it.\u201d  \u201cWe just continue to play our game and focus on shows we are proud of, and work with people we believe in,\u201d he said.  Netflix\u2019s awards included best supporting drama actress for Julia Garner in \u201cOzark.\u201d  The Apple TV+ subscription streaming service secured its first Emmy for Billy Crudup\u2019s supporting role in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d as a manipulative executive at a news network rocked by a sexual harassment scandal.  \u201cStar Wars\u201d series \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d a show on the Disney+ streaming service about a bounty hunter who protects Baby Yoda, won eight awards.  The Pop network scored best comedy for the sixth and final season of \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d a series about a once-wealthy family forced to live in a rundown motel in an out-of-the-way town.

The video streaming pioneer said in March that it was testing a 250 rupee ($3.63) monthly subscription for mobile devices in India, where data plans are among the cheapest in the world.  \u201cWe believe this plan ... will be an effective way to introduce a larger number of people in India to Netflix and to further expand our business in a market where Pay TV ARPU is low,\u201d the company said.  Netflix\u2019s new plan is aimed at battling cheaper offerings from rivals such as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Prime Video and Hotstar, a video streaming platform owned by Walt Disney Co\u2019s India unit.  Netflix currently offers three monthly plans in India, priced between 500 rupees and 800 rupees.

Netflix announced earlier this month that it was turning the books into a live-action, English-language TV series led by D.B Weiss and David Benioff, the creators of HBO megahit \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Liu serves as a consulting producer on the project.  In a letter to Netflix, the senators pointed to comments by Liu to the New Yorker magazine in 2019 about China\u2019s clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in the Xinjiang region.  \u201cIf anything, the government is helping their economy and trying to lift them out of poverty,\u201d Liu said. \u201cIf you were to loosen up the country a bit, the consequences would be terrifying.\u201d  The United States and human rights groups have criticized China\u2019s treatment of the Uighurs. China\u2019s foreign ministry has repeatedly denied the existence of internment camps in Xinjiang, calling the facilities vocational and educational institutions and accusing what it calls anti-China forces of smearing its Xinjiang policy.  Walt Disney Co DIS.N was criticized by U.S. lawmakers recently for filming parts of \"Mulan\" in Xinjiang.  In the letter to Netflix, senators led by Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said the company\u2019s decision to adapt Liu\u2019s work amounted to \u201cnormalization\u201d of the Chinese government\u2019s \u201ccrimes.\u201d  \u201cIn the face of such atrocities in (Xinjiang), there no longer exist corporate decisions of complacency, only complicity,\u201d they wrote.

(Reporting by Sayanti Chakraborty in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)","74":"(Reuters) - Netflix Inc hooked 7 million new streaming subscribers from July to September, a third more than Wall Street had expected, reassuring investors who had worried the company was facing a slowdown in its fast-paced growth.  The record number of additions in the third quarter brought Netflix\u2019s customer base to 137 million worldwide, confirming its rank as by far the world\u2019s biggest online subscription video service.  Netflix shares, already up about 78 percent so far this year, jumped 14 percent to $394.25 in after-hours trading, and boosted other high-tech stocks.  The leap in subscribers marked a sharp turnaround from three months ago, when investors sent Netflix shares tumbling 14 percent after it missed Wall Street\u2019s subscriber growth targets.  \u201cThe question at the end of Q2 was whether that miss was an aberration or signs of a longer-term slowdown in the business,\u201d said Forrester Research analyst Jim Nail. \u201cThe answer: an aberration, likely the results of a somewhat low volume of new content last quarter.\u201d  Netflix\u2019s results sent shares of Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc up about 1 percent higher in extended trade. The four make up the so-called FANG group of high-growth companies that in recent months has lost some of its momentum following market-leading gains in recent years.  HIGH CONFIDENCE  Netflix is investing more than $8 billion in entertainment programming this year to lure new customers around the world. In the third quarter, it released its largest slate of original TV shows and movies to date, including new seasons of hits such as \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d and \u201cBoJack Horseman.\u201d  That paid off in terms of new subscribers. Wall Street analysts had expected Netflix to add about 5.2 million streaming customers in the quarter.  FILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is pictured on a television in this illustration photograph taken in Encinitas, California, U.S., January 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The company exceeded forecasts in both U.S. and international markets. Netflix said it signed up roughly 1.1 million subscribers in the United States, above analysts\u2019 estimate of 674,000, according to Refinitiv. Its international business added nearly 5.9 million subscribers, compared with the average analyst estimate of 4.5 million.  In a letter to shareholders, Netflix said it saw \u201cstrong growth broadly across all our markets including Asia.\u201d  Executives said audiences welcomed shows tailored to specific markets, such as \u201cSacred Games\u201d in India, which the company identified as key to its expansion.  \u201cWe feel like we have a long, long runway ahead of us in India,\u201d Greg Peters, chief product officer, said in a post-earnings video interview.  For the current quarter, Netflix forecast it will add 1.8 million customers in the United States and 7.6 million in international markets.  \u201cWe want to assure investors that we have the same high confidence in the underlying economics as our cash investments in the past,\u201d Netflix said in its letter.  COMPETITION  During the September quarter, Netflix added about 676 hours of original programming in the United States, a 135 percent increase from a year earlier, according to Cowen and Co analysts.  Netflix has been borrowing heavily to fund such rapid growth in TV shows and movies. It has issued a net $7.5 billion of bonds in less than three years, though that could carry a cost in a changing economic environment.  \u201cRising interest rates could make Netflix increasingly vulnerable to higher cost of capital,\u201d CFRA research analyst Tuna Amobi said.  At the same time, Netflix faces competition from deep-pocketed companies such as Amazon and new streaming services from Walt Disney Co and AT&T Inc that are expected late next year.  Netflix said it expects operating margins at the lower end of the 10 percent to 11 percent range for the full year 2018. It cut its projection of negative cash flow to closer to $3 billion. The company had previously projected $3 billion to minus $4 billion.  Neil Begley, a senior analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, estimated that Netflix may spend closer to $9 billion on content this year, but he said keeping negative free cash flow to about $3 billion would not change the company\u2019s capital needs.  \u201cIt\u2019ll probably still be the case that they\u2019re going to stick to raising debt twice a year,\u201d he said.  Netflix\u2019s net income rose to $402.8 million, or 89 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $129.6 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier. That beat analysts\u2019 average estimate of 68 cents, according to Refinitiv.  Total revenue rose to $4 billion, in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, from $2.98 billion a year earlier.","75":"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE\/ or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * FAANGs jump after Netflix results beat estimates  * Dow up 0.68%, S&P 500 up 1.36%, Nasdaq up 1.97% (Adds comments; updates prices; adds New York dateline; changes byline)  Jan 20 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hit highs on Wednesday as Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th U.S. president, while solid results from Netflix sparked a rally in shares of stay-at-home winners.

REUTERS\/Hulu\/Handout  (Reuters) - Hulu is cutting the price of its most popular monthly plan by $2 to $5.99, making it one of the most affordable video streaming services in the United States as the company locks horns with Netflix and Amazon to lure more subscribers.  As part of changes announced on Wednesday, Hulu will also hike the price of its live TV option, already its highest priced plan, by $5 to $44.99 per month.  The changes by the streaming company, which is jointly owned by Walt Disney Co, Twenty-First Century Fox, Comcast and AT&T, come just days after Netflix Inc hiked prices of its most popular plan in the United States by 18 percent to $12.99.  Streaming services including Hulu, Netflix and Amazon\u2019s Prime Video are aggressively creating more original content and introducing attractive plans as they compete for subscribers.  Hulu announced this month that it finished 2018 with more than 25 million subscribers in the United States, while Netflix had 58.5 million subscribers in the country as of September. Globally, Netflix counted around 139 million users at the end of 2018.  The competition is only expected to intensify with AT&T and Disney planning to launch streaming services later this year. AT&T already runs the HBO Now streaming service, which charges $14.99 per month.  Hulu also said it would keep the price of its ad-free version at $11.99 per month.  Its pricing changes will take effect starting Feb. 26 for new subscribers, while existing users will see the changes after that date.","82":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Walt Disney Co on Thursday announced a heavy slate of new shows for its streaming services, including Marvel and Star Wars series on its fast-growing Disney+ platform and programming from reality TV fan-favorites the Kardashians for Hulu.  The blizzard of new content announcements in a marathon investor day presentation also came with bold new business targets - and programming costs of up to $16 billion in fiscal 2024 - as Disney races with U.S. entertainment industry rivals to catch up to video streaming pioneer Netflix Inc.  By the end of fiscal 2024, Disney expects to attract as many as 350 million global subscribers across all of its streaming services, easily more than double the 137 million it has today. Armed with fresh content, Disney will also raise the price of Disney+ by $1 in the U.S. to $7.99 per month and by 2 euros in continental Europe to 8.99 euros ($10.92).  The aggressive push comes as Disney taps into a home entertainment boom stoked by the global coronavirus pandemic, with more people staying indoors and seeking out new shows. Launched less than a year ago, Disney+ has already hit 86.8 million subscribers, Disney said, nearly reaching the upper end of a goal its previously set for 2024.  \u201cIt is clear our strategy has already positioned us as a leading global streaming service provider, and that is within just one year of launching Disney+,\u201d Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said.  Disney said it plans to release 10 new TV series each in the Marvel and Star Wars franchises, including two spinoffs of \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d over the next few years..  Another 15 live-action Disney Animation and Pixar shows and 15 Disney Animation and Pixar feature films will be available on the Disney+ streaming service.  Customers should expect about 100 or more titles every year, executives said in the presentation to investors.  The company announced new programming for Hulu and Star, a general entertainment service it will launch overseas in February. This will include content from the popular Kardashian family, which this year announced it was ending its long-running reality show on NBCUniversal\u2019s E! network..  Disney said it continues to expect Disney+ will reach profitability in 2024, and shares rose 4% in after-hours trading during the investor presentation.  CLOSING THE GAP  The U.S. entertainment industry has scrambled to match Netflix this year. Disney, AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia and Comcast Corp\u2019s NBCUniversal have all restructured operations to focus on streaming video services.  On Thursday, Disney set higher subscriber targets, fueled by billions of dollars invested in new programming. The company estimated it would spend between $14 billion to $16 billion on content in fiscal 2024.  FILE PHOTO: A Baby Yoda toy is pictured during a \"Star Wars\" advance product showcase in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., February 20, 2020. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri\/File Photo  Disney+ is now expected to reach 230 million to 260 million customers by 2024, up from a previous projection of 60 million to 90 million.  The company said between 30% to 40% of the new subscriber forecast came from Disney+ Hotstar in India.  Disney+ has been boosted by the popularity of \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d TV series, a Star Wars spinoff featuring the character popularly known as Baby Yoda. On Thursday, Disney said it planned two further spinoff series, \u201cThe Rangers of the New Republic\u201d and \u201cAhsoka.\u201d  Including upgraded expectations for Hulu and ESPN+, Disney said it could reach 300 million to 350 million streaming subscribers worldwide.  Those numbers would challenge Netflix, which pioneered streaming in 2007 and had 195 million paying subscribers at the end of October.  Shares of Netflix slipped 0.6% during Disney\u2019s presentation.  Hollywood is closely following Disney\u2019s plans a week after AT&T Inc\u2019s Warner Bros upended the film business by saying it would debut all 17 of its 2021 movies on its HBO Max streaming service on the same day they hit theaters..  That left cinema chains including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, Cineworld Group and Cinemark Holdings Inc disgruntled about losing the window when they can screen movies exclusively in theaters before productions hit streaming services.  Disney said on Thursday two films - \u201cPinocchio\u201d and \u201cPeter Pan & Wendy\u201d - would skip theaters and go straight to Disney+, but it did not announce sweeping changes to its movie release strategy as Warner Bros. did.  It also said \u201cWonder Woman\u201d director Patty Jenkins will also direct the next Star Wars theatrical film, \u201cRogue Squadron,\u201d expected to arrive by the end of 2023.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Netflix has ripped up the standard script. It stands virtually alone among rivals in having little if any need for the usual metrics that media companies abide by. Instead, investors have focused on its rapid subscriber and revenue growth. That has fueled its stock-market success. But the $150 billion video-streaming service\u2019s fourth-quarter performance, unveiled on Tuesday, shows how that is coming under threat.  Netflix shares are up more than fivefold since the beginning of 2015, eclipsing Walt Disney, Comcast and AT&T during the same period. All three have launched or have plans for direct-to-consumer services to go head-to-head with Netflix.  The firm led by Reed Hastings stands apart in key ways. First, it doesn\u2019t have to worry about TV ratings because it\u2019s commercial-free. That\u2019s in contrast to Comcast\u2019s NBC Universal, Disney\u2019s broadcast and cable units and AT&T\u2019s Turner suite of channels. The number of people who watch a TV series informs how much a network can charge for advertising and can bolster negotiations with distributors during contract renewals.  Box-office ticket sales are followed obsessively in Tinseltown because they prove the popularity and viability of a movie. But they\u2019re irrelevant to Netflix, which mainly screens flicks like \u201cThe Irishman\u201d in theaters only to meet antiquated standards for Oscar nominations. Instead, Netflix releases its own popularity lists \u2013 \u201cMurder Mystery\u201d topped the chart last year \u2014 though the ranking criteria is comical: It\u2019s based on the number of households watching for at least two minutes.  Revenue in the last three months of 2019 barely beat analysts\u2019 estimates, but there are other signs of strain. The net increase in U.S. subscribers is waning in part thanks to a price hike and new entrants. In the fourth quarter, Netflix missed its own domestic outlook forecast as it did in the second and third quarters. Cheaper packages from rivals are ratcheting up the pressure and also threaten Hastings\u2019 goal of reducing the company\u2019s cash burn, which hit $3.3 billion last year, by around $1 billion.  At some 60 times estimated 2020 earnings, Netflix sports a multiple more than twice that of Disney and Apple. A rich valuation comes with its own unique set of risks. If Netflix fails to rein in its spending or continue meaningful revenue growth, shareholders will rue bingeing on the company\u2019s stock.","85":"May 21 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc:  * NETFLIX SAYS BARACK OBAMA AND MICHELLE OBAMA HAVE ENTERED INTO A MULTI-YEAR AGREEMENT TO PRODUCE FILMS AND SERIES WITH THE COMPANY Source text : [bit.ly\/2x38ccI] Further company coverage:","86":"(Adds details of the Netflix deal)  LONDON\/LOS ANGELES, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s Prince Harry and his American-born wife Meghan have signed a multiyear contract with Netflix to produce programming ranging from children\u2019s shows to scripted series, the streaming platform said on Wednesday.

The ruling came ahead of the film\u2019s Sept. 9 international release on the U.S. online streaming service, and followed recent media reports of Turkish government interference in a separate planned Netflix series featuring a gay character.  The plot of \u201cCuties\u201d centres on an 11-year-old Muslim girl who \u201cstarts to rebel against her conservative family\u2019s traditions when she becomes fascinated with a free-spirited dance crew,\u201d according to Netflix.  After a board meeting, the Radio and Television High Council (RTUK) said: \u201cIt was decided unanimously that the broadcaster must remove the relevant programme from its catalogue.\u201d  A board report judged that such a film, \u201ccontaining exploitation and abuse, might lead to potential child exploitation behaviour patterns emerging,\u201d RTUK said of its first case related to a video-on-demand platform.  Netflix, the world\u2019s biggest streaming service with more than 1.5 million subscribers in Turkey, could not be immediately reached for comment on the decision.  Turkey\u2019s Family Ministry last month requested that the board evaluate the film over concerns about its impact, noting it appeared like a children\u2019s movie, but had an 18+ rating.  STANDOFF  \u201cCuties\u201d was previously criticised internationally over its promotional poster for allegedly sexualising 11-year-old girls. Netflix then apologised for what it called \u201cinappropriate artwork,\u201d saying it was not representative of the film.  President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s AK Party, which has Islamist roots, along with its nationalist allies has a majority of members in RTUK.  If Netflix goes ahead with screening the film, its licence could be temporarily suspended, Turkish media reports have said.  In July, separate media reports said a dispute had arisen between Netflix and Ankara over a gay character in a planned series.  A source familiar with the situation said at the time Netflix decided to cancel the show after authorities denied its filming permit application because of the character, and it was not able to shoot the show with its original script.  Erdogan said in July that Turkey would introduce regulations to control social media platforms or shut them down, pressing ahead with government plans after he said his family was insulted online. He referred to Netflix in those comments.","91":"(Reuters) - In the not-so-distant past, TV viewers were forced to wait a week for the next installment of their favorite shows, parceled out by networks in half-hour or hour-long increments.

In November 2010, Hulu, which debuted in 2008 as an ad-supported streaming video site, launched its subscription service, including full seasons of certain shows.

Facebook, Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet , all part of the so-called FANG group of widely held stocks, have jumped over 5% so far in July, with investors increasingly willing to bet on the volatile names thanks to expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates later this month by as much as half a percentage point to support economic growth.  The FANG companies, combined with investor favorites Apple and Microsoft, account for about 17% of the S&P 500\u2019s $26 trillion market capitalization, making reaction to their quarterly results key to Wall Street sentiment.  Netflix has been the FANG group\u2019s poorest performer this month, up just 0.2% as investors worry that looming competition from Walt Disney Co in video streaming could limit its already cooling subscriber growth.  Still, the leading video entertainment company is up 2% since its weaker-than-expected quarterly report in April, and up 37% year to date.  The reports by Netflix, scheduled for after the bell on Wednesday, followed by Microsoft on Thursday, and Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet next week could fuel gains on Wall Street, or put an end to the market\u2019s recent strength.  \u201cThe FANG stocks have done well because of overall market sentiment. But we\u2019ve come a long way in a hurry, and a little bit like a baby, you\u2019ve got to worry if there has to be a little burp,\u201d said John Brady, managing director at R.J. O\u2019Brien & Associates in Chicago.  Netflix in April forecast weaker-than-expected growth in new subscriptions, and concerns since then have only increased following announcements that Netflix will lose its two most-watched shows in the United States - \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d - to upcoming rival services from AT&T Inc and NBC Universal in 2020 and 2021, respectively.  Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, said his Diversified Equity Fund is overweight Netflix due in part to its strong original content. The fund is underweight Facebook on expectations that the company has not fully recognized the regulatory challenges it faces, including in relation to its plan to launch a cryptocurrency, which has faced a backlash from governments and central bankers since it was unveiled last month.  \u201cWho at Facebook thought it would be a good idea to bring up this Libra cryptocurrency right now? The nicest way to say it is that it was ill-advised, given everything that\u2019s on their plate,\u201d Stoeckle said.  Netflix predicted in April it would pick up a softer-than-expected 5 million new streaming subscribers in the June quarter. Analysts expect Netflix\u2019s second-quarter revenue to rise 26% to $4.93 billion, while its net income is seen falling 34% to $255 million, according to Refinitiv. Earnings per share are is expected at 56 cents.  \u201cNetflix is going to be interesting when it comes to guidance,\u201d said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research in Chicago. \u201cThey are going to have lot of competition, and I think they\u2019re going to have to give us some guidance on whether they believe they can fight it off.\u201d  Since 2002, Netflix\u2019s second-quarter reports on average have been followed by a 5.9% decline in its stock the following day, according to Bespoke Investment Group. That compares to an average increase of 0.6% in the following trading day across all quarters for Netflix.  Facebook is to post its results on July 24, followed by Amazon and Alphabet on July 25. Facebook and Alphabet face challenges including calls for increased regulation, while investors worry that Amazon\u2019s race to expand one-day shipping will cut into its profits just as competitors including Walmart and Target improve their own online sales and deliveries.  Year-to-date, Amazon has surged 35% and is less than 2% below its record high set last September.  Facebook has rallied 56% in 2019 and is 6% short of the record high it set a year ago, just before it warned of a multi-year squeeze on its business margins, sending its stock into months of decline as investors worried about fallout from the company\u2019s mishandling of users\u2019 personal information.  Even after their rallies this year, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are trading at forward price\/earnings multiples below their two-year averages.  Analysts expect Amazon\u2019s quarterly revenue to grow by 18% to $62.4 billion, with non-GAAP net income growing 10% to $2.78 billion.  Facebook\u2019s June-quarter revenue is seen jumping 25% to $16.3 billion, with net income up 6% to $5.4 billion.

Breton had a day earlier urged the video streaming service to downgrade the quality of its video to avoid internet gridlock.","103":"NEW YORK\/SEOUL (Reuters) - A zombie drama, a TV series about a supernatural nurse and one about an antisocial children\u2019s book author helped turn South Korea into one of Netflix\u2019s biggest sources of growth in the international markets, a source familiar with the matter said.  Netflix said 46% of its net new global paid customers in the third quarter came from the Asia Pacific region, where revenue rose 66% from last year, primarily Japan and South Korea, the company reported in a letter to investors on Tuesday. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/3jhdq7e)  The source cited data that could be disclosed later this week when a Netflix representative is expected to appear for South Korea\u2019s annual parliamentary audit during which the company\u2019s investment is likely to come up. It was not immediately clear exactly what will be discussed at the meeting.  The company is eager to demonstrate its big investments in the region as well as its role in making Korean pop culture popular more accessible outside of Korea.  Netflix\u2019s South Korean business has played a major role in third-quarter growth. The world\u2019s largest paid streaming video service now serves 3.3 million paid members in the region as of Sept. 30, the source said.  Overall, Netflix now serves more than 195 million paid subscribers.  The company has helped fuel and is fueled by the global popularity of the pop culture machine of South Korea. Since 2015, the world\u2019s largest subscription streaming video platform has invested nearly $700 million financing partnerships and co-productions, the source said.  Since late 2019, it has ramped up investments and landed multi-year content partnerships with Korea\u2019s major studios including CJ ENM\/Studio Dragon and JTBC for access to their Korean shows.  More than 70 Korean-made shows from local creators have been released as Netflix-branded originals around the world and are available in 31 subtitled languages and more than 20 dubbed languages.  In October, Netflix released the original documentary \u201cBlack Pink: Light Up the Sky\u201d about the highest charted female Korean act on the Billboard 100. The group\u2019s recent music video for \u201cHow You Like That\u201d broke an all-time YouTube record as the most watched video in a 24-hour period with 86.3 million views.  \u2018NETFLIX LAW\u2019  South Korea in May passed the revision to the country\u2019s telecommunications business act, dubbed as \u201cNetflix law,\u201d to require all content providers including foreign companies to share network cost burden with local internet service providers.  The revision came after Netflix in April sued South Korea\u2019s internet network operator SK Broadband, an affiliate of the country\u2019s top mobile carrier SK Telecom Co Ltd.  The two companies failed to reach an agreement on the U.S. streaming giant\u2019s use of SK Broadband\u2019s internet service without sharing network cost despite SK Broadband\u2019s expansion of network infrastructure to support Netflix\u2019s increasing traffic.

The world\u2019s biggest video streaming platform by paid customers, Netflix told Reuters more than a million of its nearly 200 million subscribers around the world are in Southeast Asia, home to around 655 million people. But the market is ripe for rapid growth, analysts say, with the Disney+ Hotstar launch in Indonesia next month set to become a key battleground.  \u201cWhat we see in Southeast Asia is that it\u2019s a very mobile-centric market\u201d, Netflix director for product innovation Ajay Arora told Reuters in a recent interview. That\u2019s led the company to push cheaper mobile plans and adapt its product to fit lower-end smartphones, Arora said.  Southeast Asia is estimated to have generated $600 million in overall subscription music and video revenue in 2019, according to a study by Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain & Co - but that\u2019s set to explode to an annual $3 billion by 2025, the study said.  Starting with India in August 2019, Netflix has now launched mobile-only plans in Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia - all priced at below $5 a month. That\u2019s a departure for Netflix, which has held firm on pricing in Western markets.  Repeated coronavirus lockdowns across Southeast Asia have also increased the appetite for content streaming at home across the region. Consultancy Media Partners Asia estimates that Southeast Asia video streaming service subscribers will reach 14.7 million in all by the end of 2020.  Netflix executive Arora said his firm is also working to expand its payment options in countries with low credit and debit card penetration. In markets like the Philippines, subscribers can pay for Netflix through their mobile telephone plans, or by purchasing prepaid Netflix cards at convenience stores.  The company faces competition in the region not just from Disney+, a distant, but ambitious, global no. 2 in the industry. Other regional rivals include Hong Kong video service Viu, popular for its Korean dramas, as well as Chinese tech giant Tencent\u2019s WeTV, which in June bought the assets of Malaysian streaming platform Iflix.  Disney+ is currently in the middle of a hiring spree across the region and is expected to launch broadly in the coming months jointly with its Indian streaming platform Hotstar. Disney\u2019s family and superhero movies have proven consistent hits in Southeast Asia.  In Indonesia, the world\u2019s fourth most populous country with 270 million people, Disney+ said last week it would start operating in September in partnership with state-owned telco Telkomsel with a catalogue that will include more than 300 local movies.  Bracing for the challenge, Netflix Southeast Asia content lead Myleeta Aga told Reuters that the firm, which announced two new original Indonesian productions earlier last Thursday, places high importance on the region and will continue to ramp up local content offerings. She said Netflix expects to start filming projects in Indonesia and Thailand soon.

The decision comes after the streaming giant also reduced traffic on networks in Europe to help internet service providers (ISPs) experiencing a surge in usage.  Indian police enforced lockdowns across large parts of the country, with curfews in some places, as health officials warned that the coronavirus was spreading out of big cities, where it first appeared into the small towns that dot the landscape.  Mobile networks could come under increased pressure as lockdowns to slow the pandemic become stricter and broader.

HBO Max launches to a captive audience stuck at home without access to theater, live music, shopping excursions or live or televised sporting events. That situation helped Netflix Inc sign up 15.8 million new paying customers in the first three months of the year, more than double what it expected to attract.  But with film and TV productions halted across the globe, HBO Max has postponed dozens of releases - most notably a \u201cFriends\u201d reunion special originally planned for launch. If HBO Max does not resume production by this fall, the service could start to see a shortage of original content as early as January, according to a source familiar with the company.  At $15 per month, the service is more expensive than both the $7 per month Disney+ streaming service and the $13 per month standard Netflix plan. Still, WarnerMedia hopes to reach about 80 million global HBO Max subscribers by 2025.  Many existing HBO subscribers in the United States will not need to do anything to get the new service, as WarnerMedia revised deals with distributors including Apple Inc, Charter Communications Inc, Hulu and most recently, Comcast Corp.  But subscribers of HBO through Amazon.com Inc and Roku Inc are out of luck as WarnerMedia has yet to strike new agreements.  For these and new customers, WarnerMedia is offering a promotion for subscribing directly with the company: $3 off the regular $15 price. Some AT&T customers will also get it at no additional cost.  HBO Max will feature 10,000 hours of content from WarnerMedia brands and libraries such as Warner Bros, New Line Cinema and Cartoon Network.

Netflix put the show on hold this month on order of a state court where Sahara alleged violation of Roy\u2019s privacy rights.  Roy is currently on bail in a case where he was ordered by court to repay billions of dollars to investors in a scheme which was found to be illegal. Roy denied wrongdoing in the case and has already repaid investors, his counsel said.  Arguing for free speech in an appeal at the High Court of eastern Bihar state, Netflix said the docuseries was an assimilation of information available in public domain. The filing has not previously been reported.  The pre-publication injunction granted by the court \u201cfreezes free speech,\u201d Netflix said in the filing earlier this month, which was reviewed by Reuters. It argued it has a right to free speech \u201con a matter of public interest.\u201d  Some Netflix shows in India have faced court challenges and police complaints for obscenity or for hurting sentiments. The ongoing legal spat is among the most high-profile ones Netflix has faced in India, one of its key growth markets.  The court in Bihar that gave the injunction earlier had said the series \u201cwould certainly damage the reputation\u201d of Roy. Sahara and Netflix declined to comment. Roy could not be reached for comment.  The U.S. streaming giant has argued it had invested large sums and done worldwide publicity on the series. The injunction, Netflix argued, resulted in irreparable monetary loss, as well as affected its goodwill and reputation.  Netflix describes \u201cBad Boy Billionaires\u201d as an \u201cinvestigative docuseries (which) explores the greed, fraud and corruption that built up - and ultimately brought down - India\u2019s most infamous tycoons.\u201d  Netflix is locked in a legal spat not just with Sahara, but also another businessman Raju whose story was to appear in the series.  Raju, accused of a $1-billion accounting fraud more than a decade ago, had secured a separate state court order against the show\u2019s release, but Netflix has challenged it in a higher court, said A. Venkatesh, a lawyer representing Raju.  Raju will continue to argue against the show\u2019s release, said Venkatesh.  Both Netflix\u2019s appeals are likely to be heard in coming days. It was not clear if the other two tycoons - Modi and Mallya - have filed petitions against the release of the series.  Modi is facing extradition attempts by India after his arrest in London last year over his alleged involvement in a $2 billion bank fraud. Mallya, too, is in Britain fighting India\u2019s extradition bid for alleged fraud at his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.  Modi and Mallya have denied any wrongdoing.  Zulfiquar Memon of Indian law firm MZM Legal, who is part of team representing Modi in his extradition case, said they hadn\u2019t filed any case to halt the release of the series, but were \u201csitting on the fence\u201d tracking the ongoing proceedings.  A lawyer for Mallya could not immediately be reached for comment.

International growth helped the streaming video service trounce expectations in the last quarter of 2019.  But the company acknowledged competition had an impact in the United States, where growth missed Wall Street targets - and that competition will become more global as the Disney+ service launches across Europe in March.  Rivals including Walt Disney Co and Apple Inc are now fighting for streaming customers, and Netflix said it expects to add 7 million subscribers globally in the first quarter, below analysts\u2019 average of 8.82 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  For a company that has historically taken great pains to avoid mentioning competitive forces - it once called the video game Fortnite a bigger rival than other streaming services - it spent a considerable amount of time explaining why Disney\u2019s power will not have as damaging an effect on its engine of growth outside of America.  \u201cDespite the big debut of Disney+ and the launch of Apple TV+, our viewing per membership grew both globally and in the U.S. on a year over year basis, consistent with recent quarters,\u201d the company wrote in a letter to investors.  Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings described the fourth quarter\u2019s 8.76 million net subscriber growth - boosted by a new season of royal drama \u201cThe Crown\u201d and two films nominated for Best Picture Oscars - as \u201cjust amazing.\u201d  That number beat Wall Street estimates for the fourth quarter, helping to send shares up 2.2% in volatile after-hours trading on Tuesday.  FILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is seen on their office in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE  The Disney+ and Apple TV+ streaming services both launched in the United States in November. Disney+, which is also live in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, will launch in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Austria and Switzerland on March 24. Apple TV+ is available in over 100 countries and regions.  The Disney+ service launched in the United States and Canada for $7 per month and $13 a month for a bundle with ESPN+ and Hulu; it reached 10 million sign-ups on its first day. Apple TV+ launched Nov. 1 for $5 per month and is free for one year with the purchase of some Apple devices: its performance has been harder to define. AT&T-owner WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO Max will cost $15 per month when it launches in May.  Netflix is available in over 190 countries; its standard U.S. plan costs $13 per month.  Netflix has had an outsized impact on the pay TV landscape, changing the way that people consume TV and film and forcing media and tech companies to shift their business models. As streaming video has grown in the United States, the market has become more competitive, pushing Netflix to look overseas for growth.  As such, the company has invested heavily in non-English language content, and this quarter began releasing revenue and subscriber numbers by region for the first time. It added 1.75 million subscribers in Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, while Latin America grew by 2.04 million subscribers in the quarter.  As rivals have pulled their content off of Netflix, the company has poured money into original TV series and films. It had a $15 billion cash budget for content last year and $14.76 billion in long-term debt as of Dec. 31, 2019.  \u201cFriends\u201d left Netflix in the United States this month and will run on HBO Max. \u201cThe Office\u201d is leaving the service at the end of 2020 and will be available on Comcast-owned NBCUniversals forthcoming Peacock streaming platform next year.  \u201cThe streaming service\u2019s massive content and marketing budget can only be justified if the company is adding more subscribers at a robust rate. If that doesn\u2019t materialize, then its stock price will reflect that reality,\u201d wrote Haris Anwar, an analyst at investing.com.  The addition of new streaming platforms - taking more out of a household\u2019s monthly entertainment budget - has also made it harder for Netflix to raise prices, as it did in the United States last year.  Free, advertising-supported services such as Peacock and ViacomCBS-owned Pluto TV may also limit Netflix\u2019s pricing power, according to research from Citigroup.  Net income rose to $587 million, or $1.30 per share, in the fourth quarter from $134 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier.  Total revenue rose to $5.5 billion from $4.2 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $5.45 billion.  The streaming giant said it added 8.76 million paid subscribers globally compared with expectations of 7.63 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","115":"PARIS (Reuters) - Vivendi\u2019s Canal+ has agreed a deal to add Netflix subscriptions to TV bundles in France and elsewhere, the French broadcaster said on Monday, in the latest such alliance to counter pressure from streaming giants.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  The new Canal+ bundles integrating Netflix would be available in France from Oct. 15 and later expanded to other European markets.  Pay-TV groups have been squeezed globally as viewers switch to online video platforms that often offer cheaper packages and churn out original productions. Netflix, with a string of hit shows such as \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cStranger Things\u201d, has been leader of the streaming pack.  Some have responded by striking deals with Netflix and other platforms to add content and keep clients from switching off, including Comcast\u2019s Sky in Britain, even if it allows streaming companies to make further inroads in their market.  \u201cPeople have already subscribed to Netflix, it\u2019s unavoidable,\u201d said Francois Godard, European media and telecoms analyst at Enders Analysis.  Canal+ has suffered after losing some soccer broadcasting rights in recent years and is still losing subscribers despite producing critically acclaimed series such as \u201cThe New Pope\u201d alongside Sky and HBO.  It has been overtaken by Netflix\u2019s 6 million subscribers in France and it reported falling first-half revenue.  Netflix\u2019s deal with Canal+ is the first of its kind in France, though the U.S. group\u2019s films and shows are already distributed via deals on internet service providers such as French telecoms group Orange.  Yet Netflix, too, is under pressure, with Apple Inc launching its own streaming service in November and Walt Disney joining the fray with Disney Plus.  \u201c(Netflix) is stepping things up to occupy this space as much as possible before others show up,\u201d said Philippe Bailly, of French digital consultancy NPA Conseil.  Canal+ Chief Executive Maxime Saada told reporters the group is also \u201cin discussions\u201d with Disney but declined to provide details. Canal+ distributes some Disney films.  It is still unclear how much pay-TV groups will succeed in winning back clients as a result of such deals. Netflix has about 10 million subscribers in the United Kingdom, roughly the same as Sky, Enders\u2019 Godard said.  The Canal+\/Netflix bundles will initially cost 35 euros a month, including the Canal+ subscription fee. Netflix offers its services in France for a monthly subscription of between 7.99 euros and 15.99 euros.  Pay-TV groups are betting consumers will prefer to have a one-stop shop.  \u201cIt is going to be very expensive for customers to buy everything,\u201d Saada said.","116":"FILE PHOTO: HBO logo is on display during an Apple event in San Francisco, California, U.S., March 9, 2015.

After a highly sought initial public offering, shares in the Dutch company had been priced on Tuesday at 240 euros, the top of their indicated range, suggesting a market capitalization of 7.1 billion euros ($8.5 billion). After the first hour of trade on the Euronext exchange on Wednesday the share price hit 480.00 euros.  It was up 82 percent at 436.70 euros by 1105 GMT.  After several European IPOs were pulled in May, bankers say strong interest in Adyen may spill over into other upcoming deals, such as German online furniture retailer Home24, which was due to price on Wednesday.  The soaring share price prompted debate over whether the offer had been underpriced.  Investors who sold in the all-secondary offering \u201cstill own about 85 percent, so focusing on what they own, they might be happy,\u201d said one banker whose bank had a role in the IPO.  \u201cThe one thing for sure is this helps the IPO sentiment in Europe.\u201d  One banker who was not involved said the issue, which will raise 947 million euros including an overallotment option, was underpriced.  \u201cIt is difficult to be in the shoes of the pricing banks ...  typically a successful IPO goes up 10-15 percent,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut the message is not that the IPO market is up and flying. Investors are very selective.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: Euro banknotes and coins are displayed in a shop in Brussels, Belgium November 14, 2017. REUTERS\/Eric Vidal\/File Photo  Prior to Adyen, the 10 biggest IPOs in Europe by gross proceeds so far this year rose less than 6 percent on average above their offer price on their first day of trading, according to Eikon data and Reuters calculations.  Adyen\u2019s sale was only open to institutional investors, and the company said on Tuesday it had been oversubscribed \u201cmultiple times.\u201d  Books had been covered at the top price within an hour of the offer being launched on June 5, which the head of a syndicate involved in the float said may have been \u201cunprecedented.\u201d  Adyen helps retailers take customer payments and usher them through complicated payment networks quickly.  Its fast growth, its flashy customer and investor lists, together with the relatively small number of shares on offer, recent strength in technology shares, and fevered M&A in the payments segment, all bolstered demand for shares of the previously little-known company.  Still, there are reasons for investor caution. The issue price was more than 70 times Adyen\u2019s 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 99.4 million euros. The company, which is debt-free and profitable, says it expects to grow sales by 25-35 percent annually.  Among major risk factors in its prospectus, Adyen cited fierce competition and the fact that its top 10 clients, which also include Vodafone, Uber and Spotify, represent around 33 percent of sales.  Those high-profile clients may demand concessions or defect to competitors, as eBay did when it decided to abandon former owner PayPal for Adyen in January. It later emerged that eBay was offered warrants worth up to a 5 percent stake in Adyen in exchange.  Adyen will face competition from rivals like WorldPay WP.O, which was bought last year by U.S. credit-card processing company Vantiv for $10.4 billion.  U.S. giant PayPal PYPL.O agreed to buy smartphone payment terminal provider iZettle last month for $2.2 billion. Worldline bought Swiss payments processor SIX Group for $2.75 billion.  U.S. fintech rivals such as Square and Stripe are also growing quickly, and some major online retailers including Amazon AMZN.O and Alibaba BABA.N are developing their own payment systems.  Adyen\u2019s offer is primarily a way for existing investors, which include the likes of General Atlantic, Index Ventures and Iconiq Capital, the Silicon Valley fund that is an investment vehicle for the founders of Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.  Including overallotments, existing shareholders sold 13.4 percent of shares in the offering, which is secondary only.  With remaining shares subject to a six-month lockup period, only a relatively small number of shares were in play on the first day of trading. In the first hour of trade, a little more than 600,000 shares traded hands - only 2 percent of the total outstanding.  \u201cLiquidity is thin. People are sitting on their shares and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the price up,\u201d said one person familiar with the deal.  Adyen co-founder and CEO Pieter van der Does, whose around 1.6 million shares in the company are worth nearly 700 million euros at current prices, eschewed any public appearances in the run-up to the IPO, meeting only with private investors. That made some sense given the business-to-business nature of the company and a business model that may not be readily understood by retail investors.  Less traditional was his decision not to ring the gong or hold any celebration at Euronext in Amsterdam on Wednesday. Some observers were also surprised by his decision not to opt for a listing on Nasdaq.  \u201cI\u2019m very proud to be building this company with such a great team,\u201d Van der Does said in a statement issued on Tuesday night. \u201cThis listing will only help us to continue to do what we are doing now: helping our merchants grow and reshaping the payments industry.\u201d  Investor Jan Hammer of Index Ventures, Adyen\u2019s largest shareholder, said the successful listing was \u201cproof that even in a traditional and highly regulated industry, building a powerful, global business is possible\u201d.  He said the company handled 108 billion euros in transactions last year out of an estimated $23 trillion globally and had room to grow despite the competition.  Another personal familiar with the IPO said it \u201cwasn\u2019t mispriced.\u201d  \u201cThey wanted pop,\u201d he said, referring to the company\u2019s founders and early investors.","118":"LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - \u201cGLOW\u201d will not proceed with Season 4 at Netflix as planned, Variety has confirmed.

Production had begun on Season 4 earlier this year but was shut down early on due to the pandemic. With no sign of when the series, which involves most of the lead actresses being in close proximity to each other in the ring, would be able to safely resume production, Netflix decided to pull the plug. According to an individual with knowledge of the situation, all of the series regulars have been paid in full for Season 4.  \u201cCOVID has killed actual humans. It\u2019s a national tragedy and should be our focus. COVID also apparently took down our show,\u201d series creators Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch said in a statement.  \u201cNetflix has decided not to finish filming the final season of \u2018GLOW.\u2019 We were handed the creative freedom to make a complicated comedy about women and tell their stories.

But it still sucks that we don\u2019t get to see these 15 women in a frame together again. We\u2019ll miss our cast of weirdo clowns and our heroic crew. It was the best job. Register to vote.

It was inspired by the short-lived 1980s wrestling TV show of the same name, which stood for \u201cGorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.\u201d  Season 3 of the show saw the \u201cGLOW\u201d team relocate to Las Vegas to perform in their own nightly show. The series was created and executive produced by showrunners Flahive and Mensch. The other executive producers were Jenji Kohan, Tara Herrmann, and Mark Burley.  \u201cGLOW\u201d is now the latest in a long list of shows to get their renewals reversed due to the pandemic.

It also missed targets for new subscribers overseas.  \u201cIndia is a mobile-first nation, where many first-time users are experiencing the internet on their phones. In such a scenario, a mobile-only package makes sense to target new users,\u201d said Tarun Pathak, analyst at Counterpoint Research.

The country figures prominently in Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings\u2019 global expansion plans.  \u201cWe believe this plan, which will launch in the third quarter, will be an effective way to introduce a larger number of people in India to Netflix and to further expand our business,\u201d the company said in a letter to investors released late on Wednesday.  Netflix currently offers three monthly plans in India, priced between 500 rupees ($7.27) and 800 rupees $11.63).  It has created a niche following in the country by launching local original shows like the thriller \u201cSacred Games\u201d and dystopian tale \u201cLeila\u201d, which feature popular Bollywood actors.  The second season of \u201cSacred Games\u201d is set to release in August.

REUTERS\/Gonzalo Fuentes  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Netflix\u2019s growth stumble is a small gift to rivals. The streaming-video service attracted fewer subscribers than forecast in the second quarter, knocking more than $20 billion off its value. That will comfort Walt Disney and Comcast as they wage a costly battle for parts of Twenty-First Century Fox and Sky. Yet even a more sluggish Netflix remains far ahead in the race.  The company led by Reed Hastings added 5.2 million net new customers globally in the latest period. That represents an annualized growth rate of nearly 18 percent. And the company grew its typically meager earnings by nearly six times, to $384 million.  Yet Netflix is judged on its subscriber growth rather than profit, and a company with its sky-high valuation \u2013 its shares had more than doubled since the start of the year \u2013 could ill afford to miss its forecast by 1 million customers. Investors pushed the shares 14 percent lower in the first hour following the release of results after the closing market bell on Monday.  Still it\u2019s a leader of streaming services with a global audience reach of nearly 125 million paying subscribers, which is why even after Monday\u2019s rout the company\u2019s value was up some 80 percent since the end of last year to about $150 billion. But the plunge also underscores that Netflix\u2019s spending \u2013 some $8 billion on TV shows and movies and a cash burn of up to $4 billion this year \u2013 to get more viewers is a risky trade-off.  That budget does bring a form of soft power in Hollywood. Last week Netflix beat out HBO in Emmy nominations thanks to shows like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cGLOW,\u201d breaking the pay-TV network\u2019s 17-year streak in the No. 1 spot. HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is still top dog in recognition but that show is nearing its end and new parent AT&T may not have the stomach or the ability to match Netflix\u2019s devil-may-care attitude.  Other rivals are focusing their spending on mergers that could prove to be even greater risks given the ever-increasing offers on hand. Disney has bumped its bid for parts of Fox by some 36 percent above its original agreement, to $71.3 billion. Comcast last week one-upped the Mickey Mouse owner with a $34 billion bid for European satellite firm Sky, and may yet try to spoil it again with an even higher offer for Fox.  The reason for the madness? Traditional media is caught on the back foot after initially playing down Netflix\u2019s potential and licensing content to it for short-term revenue. Despite its recent setback, Netflix has a 10-year head start. A couple of weight-inducing acquisitions will not make rivals more fleet of foot.","122":"* Powell to testify before Congress at 10.00 a.m. ET  * Netflix sinks on subscriber miss, weighs on tech stocks  * Amazon falls as tech glitch hurts prime day  * UNH drops as medical costs rise; J&J gains on profit beat  * Futures: Dow flat, S&P dips 0.11 pct, Nasdaq down 0.13 pct (Adds comment, details; updates prices)  By Amy Caren Daniel  July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open lower on Tuesday as Netflix slumped after reporting weak subscriber growth and weighed on other technology stocks and as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s Congressional testimony.

Known for acclaimed shows such as \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown,\u201d Netflix will soon own up to 35 billboard displays on roughly two dozen structures along West Hollywood\u2019s famed Sunset Strip, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.  Netflix, already a heavy advertiser on billboards in the area, was offering $300 million in April to acquire Los Angeles-based Regency Outdoor Advertising, Reuters previously reported.  The sources told Reuters that Netflix decided to buy only half of Regency\u2019s assets for $150 million, to focus on the Sunset Strip in a deal expected to close in July. It is also considering acquiring other Regency billboards in Hollywood, such as near the Dolby Theatre, home of the Academy Awards, they added.  A Netflix spokesman had no comment.  Locking up prime ad inventory on the busy Sunset Strip - seen daily by actors, writers and directors - is Netflix\u2019s latest move to demonstrate its prowess to be a leading Hollywood producer and distributor. The company plans to release about 700 original TV series, movies and other programming this year.  The new strategy calls for Netflix to use the billboards in house and not rent space to other companies, according to the people, who asked to remain anonymous because the agreement has not been announced.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  That means advertisements for rivals such as AT&T Inc's T.N HBO and CBS Corp's CBS.N Showtime, which currently promote shows on Regency billboards in the area, will cycle off once the deal closes, a person close to the talks said.  This approach differs from CBS and other media companies that have owned billboards but rented space out to other media customers. That said, competing TV and movie producers still will have access to dozens of billboards owned by other companies on the Sunset Strip and in other locations across Los Angeles.  Representatives for HBO and Showtime had no comment.  Advertising on billboards is part of the $2 billion that Netflix plans to spend on marketing this year to help grow its 125 million streaming customer base around the world.  Billboards must compete with digital advertising and the fact that people often are glued to their phones rather than the advertising on the street. And yet advertisers remain interested in billboards in part because they are hard to ignore by captive audiences in cars, and many take photos of them to post on social media, expanding their reach.  In Hollywood, studios use billboards to impress talent with a highly visible show of support. This helps lure filmmakers who crave attention for their movies, which Netflix releases in only a limited number of theaters, according to one Hollywood executive.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  \u201cThis is a way for you to feel better that your name and your product and your film is getting the exposure to the public that you want at some level,\u201d the executive said.  A STRATEGY TO SPEND AND SAVE  Netflix will save marketing dollars over time in the deal because its rates will never go up on these billboards, and it could recoup the deal\u2019s cost in a short time, sources said.  \u201cIt makes total economic sense,\u201d said Gino Sesto, owner and founder of Dash Two, a company that buys outdoor and digital advertising for clients including Universal Music Group and Vice Media.  Renting a single billboard on the Sunset Strip averages around $25,000 a month, Sesto said. For billboards it owns, Netflix would have to pay only the price of replacing the vinyl on the sign, which costs about $800, plus minimal maintenance costs, he said.  Plus, Netflix will have more flexibility to change a billboard in the middle of a month.  \u201cNetflix has got so many shows that they can literally blanket the market for one show for a week, and then switch it out,\u201d he said.  The billboards\u2019 value stands to appreciate over time, particularly because Los Angeles authorities rarely approve construction of new ones, Sesto said.  Out-of-home advertising, which includes billboards, bus shelters and other locations, is the only traditional advertising platform projected to grow in the United States in 2018, according to Magna Global. The media buying firm projects a 21.9 percent increase to $8 billion.  Netflix could choose to upgrade static billboards to digital signs, which can play several video messages, or try adding other technology. Operators have been experimenting with having the signs interact with mobile phones and sometimes display personalized messages.  Even if they have to find a new billboard operator on the Sunset Strip, competitors could pull a copy-cat move: A process is still ongoing to sell the rest of Regency\u2019s assets.  PJ Solomon, a unit of Natixis SA CNAT.PA, advised Netflix and Moelis advised Regency Outdoor. The legal advisers were Loeb & Loeb for Netflix and Manatt for Regency. PJ Solomon, Moelis and Manatt declined to comment while Loeb & Loeb did not respond to a request for comment on the deal.","124":"FILE PHOTO: A smartphone with the Netflix logo lies in front of displayed \"Streaming service\" words in this illustration taken March 24, 2020.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  It faces an uphill battle when it launches its Apple TV+ streaming service on Nov. 1 for $5 a month against rivals with deeper libraries and years of experience making hit shows.  To quickly build a subscriber base, Apple is offering a year of free service for customers who purchase most Apple devices. Several Wall Street analysts said on Monday that the company could sell as many as 200 million of its latest iPhones to existing users upgrading their old phones.  Apple TV+ - which at launch will include eight original shows, including \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d featuring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon and \u201cSee,\u201d a sci-fi drama featuring Jason Momoa - will be available in over 100 markets at launch.  The big question is whether those customers will stick around after the free trial ends.  Ahead of the announcement, analysts and investors viewed Apple, which is late to the streaming war, as facing a tough fight competing with Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Walt Disney Co's DIS.N Disney+. Apple is also trying to win out over HBO Max with its hit shows like \"Game of Thrones,\" \"Friends\" and \"The Sopranos.\"  Apple's offerings are dwarfed by the extensive catalog of industry leader Netflix Inc NFLX.O, which has a reported $10 billion budget for content and 151 million paid subscribers. tmsnrt.rs\/2N6OB2j  Walt Disney Co's DIS.N Disney+ - launching Nov. 12 - has helped lift the stock almost 20% in recent months. Disney, which already controls the fast-growing streaming service Hulu, boasts a deep library of Marvel's superhero hits, the Star Wars universe, \"Toy Story\" creator Pixar animation and the National Geographic channel.  Disney+ has a budget of over $1 billion for original content - a figure that will grow to around $2 billion by 2024. It is priced higher than Apple TV+, at $7 monthly or $70 annually. A bundle that includes ESPN+ and Hulu will cost $13 per month.  Media executives and analysts believe that most households are willing to pay for more than one streaming service. Many believe existing Netflix subscribers are unlikely to cancel their subscription to pay for other services. IAC IAC.O Chairman Barry Diller told CNBC in July that Disney has the best chance of catching up to Netflix \u201cbecause of its very, very popular content.\u201d  Apple will not directly compete with Amazon Inc's AMZN.O Prime Video because that service is bundled with other perks of Prime membership - most significantly, free one- or two-day delivery on most Amazon orders.  Next spring, Apple will face another significant rival in television: HBO. The forthcoming HBO Max, from AT&T T.N's WarnerMedia, likely priced at $16 to $17 per month, has a library of HBO, Warner Bros and other content, and is investing in original content as well.  Apple, which is spending $2 billion on original content this year, is sitting on $210.6 billion in cash. \u201cApple has the firepower to outspend a company like Disney by a wide degree,\u201d said media analyst Rich Greenfield. \u201cIf Apple makes great content, people will subscribe.\u201d  For now, Apple TV+\u2019s greatest advantage is its reach and its scale.

Disney and others will vie for subscribers and likely drive up production costs.  Costing a reported 100 million pounds ($125 million) to make, \u201cThe Crown\u201d won critical acclaim and has helped Netflix build its subscriber base, which has risen to 152 million and given it a head start over rival pay-TV and technology firms.  \u201cIt\u2019s a whole new world starting in November,\u201d Hastings said.  He cited the planned launch of services by Apple and Disney, as well as a ramping up of Amazon\u2019s offerings and the forthcoming Peacock platform from NBCUniversal.  The new video-on-demand subscription services are good news for producers, with rival platforms competing to poach the best content and talent, Hastings said.  \u201cSomeday \u2018The Crown\u2019 will look like a bargain,\u201d he said.  The show is intended to span 60 episodes over six seasons.  Claire Foy starred in the first two seasons, which traced the life of Queen Elizabeth from her coronation at the age of 25 to the birth of her children and the love affairs of her sister, all while taking in the political dramas of the day.  Oscar winner Olivia Colman will star in the role when the third series launches in November.  Netflix\u2019s stock has tumbled 26% since its quarterly report on July 17, when it said it lost U.S. streaming customers for the first time in eight years and missed targets for new subscribers overseas.  Apple\u2019s streaming service debuts on Nov. 1, starting in the United States and some other countries, followed by Disney\u2019s on Nov. 12.  \u201cPeople are increasingly understanding that competition is here, and it\u2019s going to increase,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Neil Macker. \u201cCompanies like Disney are willing to bleed cash for years to compete in this space.\u201d  Following on the success of \u201cThe Crown\u201d, Hastings said Netflix would make a \u201cbig increase\u201d in its investment in British television production next year, taking advantage of the country\u2019s strong storytelling expertise.  \u201cThe possibilities the internet brings for growing entertainment is phenomenal, and over the next several years, with all of the expansion, I think we are going to see a very large increase in how much content is produced here in the UK,\u201d he said at the conference.  \u201cThis year we spent a little over 400 million pounds in the UK and that\u2019s continuing to grow, following our subscriber base.\u201d  Asked if Netflix would spend twice as much next year, he said: \u201cProbably not double, but a big increase.\u201d","130":"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Nordic Entertainment Group (NENT) hopes to lure investors with robust growth in streaming when it is spun off from Sweden\u2019s MTG next year, betting that its Scandi dramas will help it narrow the gap with market leader Netflix.  FILE PHOTO: Nordic Entertainment Group (NENT) sign is seen at their headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden October 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Olof Swahnberg\/File Photo  Media Group MTG decided earlier this year to split in two and list the Nordic TV business, NENT, on the stock exchange, after Danish telecoms company TDC dropped a planned $2.5 billion takeover of the business.  Nordic streaming services benefit from Europe\u2019s highest penetration rates, supported by some of the best broadband in the world, and strong English-language skills that saw Netflix make it one of its first markets outside the Americas in 2012.  Stockholm-based NENT offers free and pay TV, radio, advertising-based streaming service Viafree and a subscriber-based streaming service, Viaplay, whose hit shows include Swedish political thriller \u201cConspiracy of Silence\u201d and Swedish and Danish crime drama \u201cThe Lawyer\u201d. It operates in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. Viaplay accounts for around 15 percent of NENT\u2019s sales and is its biggest growth-driver, financial analysts have said.  \u201cWhen we go to the market.. our message will focus on streaming, growth in video on demand,\u201d said Chief Executive Anders Jensen. \u201cIn streaming we aim to gain market share,\u201d he told Reuters.  Netflix had 40 percent of the Nordic market in the first quarter based on number of subscribers, down from 50 percent a year earlier, according to media consultancy firm Mediavision.  Around 45 percent of 11 million Nordic households paid for at least one streaming service in the first quarter, up from nearly 40 percent the previous year, according to Mediavision.  Viaplay does not disclose subscriber or financial numbers. Overall, NENT Group expects to grow by less than 10 percent annually due to slowly declining linear TV viewing. Jensen declined to be more specific as the company plans to release long-term financial targets ahead of its listing in March.  Jensen said: \u201cI think [streaming] penetration will continue to increase to closer to 100 percent in the coming years. We want to take a good deal of that growth.\u201d  Viaplay competes with Bonnier Broadcasting\u2019s C More, Discovery\u2019s Dplay and Eurosport Player. All four are growing faster than Netflix, according to Mediavision.  NENT, which increased its sales last year by 7 percent organically to 13.7 billion Swedish crowns ($1.52 billion), sees the Nordic streaming market growing by around 17 percent annually in the period 2017 through 2021.  Last year was the second straight year with organic growth above 5 percent as the streaming market expands.  Jensen said he expected a total of over 50 original productions, including 14 already released, within the next few years. NENT also holds Nordic rights for several major sports, including the Champions League, the Premier League and the NHL.  Growth could also come from its discussions with mobile telecom operators to combine mobile connectivity with its content and sharing content with rivals as it has with Telia on ice hockey for Finnish clients, Jensen said.","131":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc's NFLX.O animated holiday movie \"Klaus\" has been watched in nearly 30 million households worldwide during its first month, landing among the streaming service's most-watched original movies, according to data the company provided to Reuters.  A still image from the animated film \"Klaus\" is seen in this undated handout received on December 18, 2019. Netflix\/Handout via REUTERS  \"Klaus,\" a story of how Santa came to be, is Netflix's first original animated film and part of an effort to build a library of family programming as it competes with new streaming rivals including Walt Disney Co DIS.N.

The company counts a view when an account streams at least 70% of a movie.  \u201cKlaus\u201d has attracted high repeat viewing that is not included in the nearly 30 million figure, Netflix said. The number reflects viewership over the first 28 days since its Nov. 15 debut.  Made mainly using hand-drawn animation, the film tells the story of a selfish postman and a reclusive toymaker who form an unlikely friendship. It was written and directed by Spanish animator and \u201cDespicable Me\u201d creator Sergio Pablos and features the voices of J.K. Simmons and Jason Schwartzman.  The world\u2019s largest streaming service, Netflix boasts more than 158 million subscribers around the world. But it is facing new competition, particularly from Disney, which has been removing its movies from Netflix and putting them on the Disney+ streaming service.  Netflix has disclosed other data to show the appeal of its children\u2019s and family programming. It previously announced that live-action movie \u201cTall Girl\u201d was watched by more than 40 million accounts during its first four weeks, and Indian animated series \u201cMighty Little Bheem\u201d has been viewed by 27 million.

They include comedy \u201cThe Willoughbys,\u201d an adaptation of a children\u2019s book, and musical \u201cOver the Moon.\u201d  Executives at Netflix have said they plan to be more transparent with audience data to satisfy Hollywood producers and stars and to help viewers decide what to watch.

Known for acclaimed shows such as \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown,\u201d Netflix will soon own up to 35 billboard displays on roughly two dozen structures along West Hollywood\u2019s famed Sunset Strip, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.  Netflix, already a heavy advertiser on billboards in the area, was offering $300 million in April to acquire Los Angeles-based Regency Outdoor Advertising, Reuters previously reported.  The sources told Reuters that Netflix decided to buy only half of Regency\u2019s assets for $150 million, to focus on the Sunset Strip in a deal expected to close in July. It is also considering acquiring other Regency billboards in Hollywood, such as near the Dolby Theatre, home of the Academy Awards, they added.  A Netflix spokesman had no comment.  Locking up prime ad inventory on the busy Sunset Strip - seen daily by actors, writers and directors - is Netflix\u2019s latest move to demonstrate its prowess to be a leading Hollywood producer and distributor. The company plans to release about 700 original TV series, movies and other programming this year.  The new strategy calls for Netflix to use the billboards in house and not rent space to other companies, according to the people, who asked to remain anonymous because the agreement has not been announced.  That means advertisements for rivals such as AT&T Inc\u2019s HBO and CBS Corp\u2019s Showtime, which currently promote shows on Regency billboards in the area, will cycle off once the deal closes, a person close to the talks said.  This approach differs from CBS and other media companies that have owned billboards but rented space out to other media customers. That said, competing TV and movie producers still will have access to dozens of billboards owned by other companies on the Sunset Strip and in other locations across Los Angeles.  Representatives for HBO and Showtime had no comment.  Advertising on billboards is part of the $2 billion that Netflix plans to spend on marketing this year to help grow its 125 million streaming customer base around the world.  Billboards must compete with digital advertising and the fact that people often are glued to their phones rather than the advertising on the street. And yet advertisers remain interested in billboards in part because they are hard to ignore by captive audiences in cars, and many take photos of them to post on social media, expanding their reach.  In Hollywood, studios use billboards to impress talent with a highly visible show of support. This helps lure filmmakers who crave attention for their movies, which Netflix releases in only a limited number of theaters, according to one Hollywood executive.  \u201cThis is a way for you to feel better that your name and your product and your film is getting the exposure to the public that you want at some level,\u201d the executive said.  A STRATEGY TO SPEND AND SAVE  Netflix will save marketing dollars over time in the deal because its rates will never go up on these billboards, and it could recoup the deal\u2019s cost in a short time, sources said.  \u201cIt makes total economic sense,\u201d said Gino Sesto, owner and founder of Dash Two, a company that buys outdoor and digital advertising for clients including Universal Music Group and Vice Media.  Renting a single billboard on the Sunset Strip averages around $25,000 a month, Sesto said. For billboards it owns, Netflix would have to pay only the price of replacing the vinyl on the sign, which costs about $800, plus minimal maintenance costs, he said.  Plus, Netflix will have more flexibility to change a billboard in the middle of a month.  \u201cNetflix has got so many shows that they can literally blanket the market for one show for a week, and then switch it out,\u201d he said.  The billboards\u2019 value stands to appreciate over time, particularly because Los Angeles authorities rarely approve construction of new ones, Sesto said.  Out-of-home advertising, which includes billboards, bus shelters and other locations, is the only traditional advertising platform projected to grow in the United States in 2018, according to Magna Global. The media buying firm projects a 21.9 percent increase to $8 billion.  Netflix could choose to upgrade static billboards to digital signs, which can play several video messages, or try adding other technology. Operators have been experimenting with having the signs interact with mobile phones and sometimes display personalized messages.  Even if they have to find a new billboard operator on the Sunset Strip, competitors could pull a copy-cat move: A process is still ongoing to sell the rest of Regency\u2019s assets.  PJ Solomon, a unit of Natixis SA, advised Netflix and Moelis advised Regency Outdoor. The legal advisers were Loeb & Loeb for Netflix and Manatt for Regency.

Subscribers to the world\u2019s largest streaming service can now watch Poacher, a Kenyan drama about elephant poaching and \u00d2l\u00f2t\u016br\u00e9, a Nigerian thriller about a journalist whose world falls apart after she goes undercover as a sex worker.  The films avoid the simplistic portrayals that viewers in Africa often resent, the producers say.  Netflix has begun screening more content produced in Africa, and in June released romantic comedy \u201cCook Off\u201d, Zimbabwe\u2019s first offering on the streaming service.

The other movie, \u00d2l\u00f2t\u016br\u00e9, joins a host of Nigerian films on the platform, which has nearly 193 million subscribers globally.  \u00d2l\u00f2t\u016br\u00e9 was shot on the gritty streets and in rundown homes of Lagos. It tells the story of impoverished sex workers lured into being trafficked overseas. Human Rights Watch ranks Nigeria a top origin country of trafficking victims in Europe and elsewhere.  In one scene, a businessman drugs and rapes the undercover journalist at a party. In another, sex workers endure a voodoo initiation to scare them into loyalty to pimps trafficking them to Italy.  \u201cI am very happy that this conversation has started so that the government will sit up to their responsibility, so that the agencies that are tasked with fighting human trafficking in Nigeria will maybe clamour for more funding or sit up and do better,\u201d said co-producer James Amuta.

Given Wall Street expects Apple to sell at least 130 million iPhones outside of China in the next 12 months, and that last year it sold more than 60 million Macbooks and iPads, that should allow TV+ to easily top Netflix's almost 160 million users. bit.ly\/2lL8G1X  Thereafter, however, all bets will be off, with Apple facing the same need for fresh shows to make subscribers pay, which drove Netflix to sink a reported here $12 billion into new programing last year.  While the company has spent months assembling a roster of Hollywood talent and planned shows, analysts say the $2 billion Apple plans to spend this year is a long way from a guarantee of the hits it would need to pull in viewers, regardless of the cheaper $5 per month price tag for TV+.  \u201cWe believe Netflix\u2019s 10-year head start, scale, breath of content and customer engagement is unlikely to be dented by an Apple TV+ subscription service with a relatively light content slate and no library content,\u201d Credit Suisse analysts said.  CROWDS  The video streaming market is on the verge of becoming a very crowded space, with the new services from Apple and Walt Disney set to compete with Hulu, Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Prime Video and HBO Max.  Analysts say that will change the nature of a business where the relatively limited number of services and the idiosyncrasy of them - Prime for example is bundled with Amazon\u2019s free delivery service - meant users rarely had to choose.  Whereas Netflix in the past took content from a wide range of studios and networks, now many of them will have their own streaming services and keep franchises like, for example, the Marvel cinematic universe, to themselves.  Launching on Nov. 1 in 100 countries, Apple TV+ promises to launch a new show every week and has already announced drama \u201cSee\u201d starring Jason Momoa, \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d with Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, and \u201cHelpsters,\u201d a children\u2019s series from the makers of \u201cSesame Street.\u201d  But that still leaves it way short of the 700 separate shows Netflix made last year, including dozens in the U.S. list of top 100 most-watched. The streaming pioneer also reportedly plans to up spending to $15 billion this year here.  \u201cApple is primarily focused on selling subscriptions to other services (e.g. HBO, Showtime) and modestly focused on original content,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta who currently owns Apple shares.  \u201cIt seems unlikely that new entrants such as Apple TV Plus will be able to find a footing given how crowded the field has become.\u201d  In that light, Apple\u2019s main focus with the project may prove to be as much keeping iPhone and iPad sales rolling as wading into a costly streaming war.  Analysts from another Wall Street brokerage, Wedbush, said Apple\u2019s base of 900 million global iPhone users could allow it to steal 100 million streaming subscribers within 3-4 years. But they also pointed to iPhone sales, particularly in China, as the company\u2019s bigger priority.  \u201cApple is offering Apple TV+ free for a year ... to help stimulate demand for its trifecta of (new) smartphones,\u201d Wedbush said. \u201cCook & Co. recognize this is a crucial product cycle.\u201d","137":"TOKYO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Sony Corp is in final talks with AT&T to acquire U.S. animation-streaming service Crunchyroll in a deal worth more than 100 billion yen ($957 million), the Nikkei business daily reported on Friday.

The company is eager to demonstrate its big investments in the region as well as its role in making Korean pop culture popular more accessible outside of Korea.  Netflix\u2019s South Korean business has played a major role in third-quarter growth. The world\u2019s largest paid streaming video service now serves 3.3 million paid members in the region as of Sept. 30, the source said.  The company has helped fuel and is fueled by the global popularity of the pop culture machine of South Korea. Since 2015, the world\u2019s largest subscription streaming video platform has invested nearly $700 million financing partnerships and co-productions, the source said.  Since late 2019, it has ramped up investments and landed multi-year content partnerships with Korea\u2019s major studios including CJ ENM\/Studio Dragon and JTBC for access to their Korean shows.  More than 70 Korean-made shows from local creators have been released as Netflix-branded originals around the world and are available in 31 subtitled languages and more than 20 dubbed languages.  In October, Netflix released the original documentary \u201cBlack Pink: Light Up the Sky\u201d about the highest charted female Korean act on the Billboard 100. The group\u2019s recent music video for \u201cHow You Like That\u201d broke an all-time YouTube record as the most watched video in a 24-hour period with 86.3 million views.  \u2018NETFLIX LAW\u2019  South Korea in May passed the revision to the country\u2019s telecommunications business act, dubbed as \u201cNetflix law,\u201d to require all content providers including foreign companies to share network cost burden with local internet service providers.  The revision came after Netflix in April sued South Korea\u2019s internet network operator SK Broadband, an affiliate of the country\u2019s top mobile carrier SK Telecom Co Ltd.  The two companies failed to reach an agreement on the U.S. streaming giant\u2019s use of SK Broadband\u2019s internet service without sharing network cost despite SK Broadband\u2019s expansion of network infrastructure to support Netflix\u2019s increasing traffic.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  California-based Netflix currently offers three monthly plans in India, ranging from 500 rupees to 800 rupees, but those are still expensive compared with similar offerings from rivals.  Amazon\u2019s Prime service, which offers video streaming, music and faster shipping of purchases, is priced at 999 rupees a year while local rival Hotstar has a free service as well paid plans starting at 365 rupees a year.  Netflix\u2019s test plan at 250 rupees a month gives users access to standard definition video on smartphones and tablets, a company spokesman said.  \u201cWe will be testing different options in select countries where members can, for example, watch Netflix on their mobile device for a lower price and subscribe in shorter increments of time,\u201d he added.  Netflix\u2019s Indian roster includes blockbuster originals such as \u201cSacred Games\u201d, global superhits such as \u201cNarcos\u201d as well as Indian cinema. However, its premium pricing is seen by critics as a stumbling block to bulking up its Indian user base.  Chief Executive Reed Hastings told Reuters late last year that Netflix had no plans for cheaper prices in India, where it aims to win its next 100 million subscribers.  The company emphasized on Tuesday that the new plan is a test and the company might not roll out these specific plans beyond the tests.  Netflix\u2019s strategy to launch the test for mobile devices in India comes against the backdrop of rising demand for smartphones in the world\u2019s second-biggest mobile phone market with more than 1.1 billion wireless connections.  Aspirational buyers looking for bigger screens and better user experience are likely to spend more on their second or third smartphones, pushing up the average selling price by 18 percent from last year to $190, said Tarun Pathak of technology researcher Counterpoint.","142":"BRASILIA\/SAO PAULO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc on Thursday appealed to Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court against an injunction preventing the video streaming service from showing a controversial Christmas special.  On Wednesday, a court in Rio de Janeiro ordered Netflix to stop showing the content in Brazil. In its Thursday filing, Netflix criticized that decision for censoring the comedy group Porta dos Fundos, which produced the special in which Jesus is portrayed as homosexual.  On Christmas Eve a group of hooded men attacked the headquarters of Porta dos Fundos with Molotov cocktails. No one was hurt, but police said they were investigating the incident as an attempted homicide after a group claimed responsibility in a video including a far-right religious statement.

Thatcher enters the Netflix television series portraying the British royal family as it moves into the 1980s, when the polarizing Conservative Party leader was at the height of her power.  Anderson said she used no prosthetics, not even teeth, but relied on body language and vocal idiosyncrasies to capture Thatcher\u2019s appearance.  \u201cIt came down to holding my mouth in the right way,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThen she had very specific mannerisms in terms of how she cocks her head, and how she leans forward.  \u201cYou start putting those things together and at some point you end up in the realm of Margaret Thatcher,\u201d said Anderson.  Thatcher was Britain\u2019s first female prime minister and her 11-year-term in office was the longest of the 20th century. She died aged 87 in 2013.  The new season of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d released on Netflix on Sunday, covers the escalation of conflict in Northern Ireland and the Falklands War. It will also portray the unhappy marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, who will be played by Emma Corrin.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Anderson said the first time she ran into Corrin, when both actors were in full costume, \u201cwas kind of like a Madame Tussauds moment.\u201d  Anderson, who grew up in both Britain and the United States and is best known for television\u2019s \u201cThe X Files,\u201d had plenty of material to work with to capture Thatcher.  \u201cA lot of people have played her to acclaim before, so that\u2019s always a bit daunting,\u201d she said, referring to the likes of Meryl Streep, an Oscar winner for \u201cThe Iron Lady.\u201d  \u201cAlso she\u2019s certainly quite a character and people had very strong opinions about her either way.

The company said it added 8.51 million paid subscribers during the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of 6.1 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","145":"Jan 18 (Reuters) - Shares of Netflix Inc fell more than 2 percent on Friday, as several investors looked past its record subscriber numbers and instead focused on its lower-than-expected revenue forecast for the first quarter.  Investors were hoping for a robust outlook after the video streaming pioneer, which boasts of popular shows such as \u201cThe Crown\u201d and Black Mirror\u201d, raised prices for most U.S. subscribers earlier this week.  \u201cMany investors we spoke with in recent days expected the price increase to flow through to improved free cash flow guide. That didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Bernstein analysts wrote in a note to clients.  Even so, Netflix remains the best performing FAANG stock this year with more than a 30 percent surge. Its shares recently traded at about 83 times expected earnings for the next 12 months. Stocks trading at high earnings multiples are more prone to sell off if growth targets are missed.  While investors seemed a bit disappointed, Wall Street analysts remained unfazed by the shortfall in the company\u2019s forecast.  At least 14 analysts raised their price targets, with RBC Capital Markets pushing its estimate by $30 to $480, well past the stock\u2019s median target of $410.  \u201cNetflix offers a truly compelling value proposition with global appeal,\u201d analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note to clients.  \u201c(The company) still only accounts for perhaps 10 percent of all TV viewing hours in the U.S. This is growth defined, in our view.\u201d  Netflix has seen blistering growth in the past few years and has bet heavily on international subscriber additions, spending billions of dollars to bolster its original content.  It boasts of award-winning shows such as \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cWild Wild Country\u201d that has helped it fend off intensifying competition from Amazon.com\u2019s Prime Video service and Hulu. The company reported 139 million paid customers at the end of December.  But that growth has come at the cost of a rising debt pile - its long-term debt at the end of 2018 rose to a staggering $10.36 billion from $3.36 billion in 2016.  Wedbush analysts, however, said that if \u201cNetflix is able to improve its free cash flow by $1 billion per year, it will see its debt peak at $13 billion, and will be debt free in 2026\u201d.  The company said it expects free cash flow in 2019 to be similar to 2018, but sees improvement each year thereafter.  Shares of the company were down 2 percent at $346.17 in early trading.

Needham analyst Laura Martin, who downgraded the California-based tech giant to \"underperform\", believes Netflix will have to add a lower priced service to compete with competitors including Apple Inc's AAPL.O Apple TV+ service and Walt Disney Co's DIS.N Disney+.  The cut came a day after Netflix dominated nominations for January\u2019s Golden Globe awards, landing 17 in TV categories and 17 more for movies, including leading contenders \u201cMarriage Story\u201d and \u201cThe Irishman\u201d.  Netflix\u2019s video streaming push has seen subscriber numbers dwarf those of rival services at the cost of huge investment in both regional and international content on its platform.  The streaming service had 60.62 million paid subscribers in the United States as of its latest quarter ended Sept. 30, accounting for over a third of its global subscriber base.  The approach comes at the cost of a rising debt pile, which stood at $12.43 billion as of Sept. 30, sparking concerns among investors.  Martin argued that the video streaming pioneer\u2019s staunch refusal to allow advertising on its platform force it to stick with premium price points which will result in subscriber losses in its most profitable market.  \u201cNetflix\u2019s premium price tier of $9 to 16 per month is unsustainable,\u201d Martin said, adding that the loss of popular TV shows such as \u201cFriends\u201d and \u2018The Office\u2019 to its competitors could hit the company\u2019s value over time.  Netflix shares, which have been under pressure this year, fell 2.6% to $294.50 in trading before the bell on Tuesday.  Martin is now the sixth analyst to rate the stock sell or lower.

The plot of \u201cCuties\u201d centers around an 11-year-old Muslim girl who \u201cstarts to rebel against her conservative family\u2019s traditions when she becomes fascinated with a free-spirited dance crew,\u201d according to Netflix.  Texas representative Matt Schaefer tweeted here a picture of the indictment document and NBC News reported the matter earlier on Tuesday.  \u201cCuties\u201d was previously criticized internationally for allegedly sexualizing 11-year-old girls in its promotional poster. Netflix later apologized for the \u201cinappropriate artwork\u201d, saying it was not representative of the film.  Last month, Turkey's broadcasting watchdog said here it would order Netflix to block access locally to the film on grounds that it contains images of child exploitation.","156":"FILE PHOTO: A view shows the exterior of Hulu's \"Seinfeld: The Apartment\", a temporary exhibit on West 14th street in the Manhattan borough of New York City, June 24, 2015.

Slideshow ( 5 images )  Launched in 2014 in France - where it employs 40 people, and has existing operations in Paris - Netflix has developed 24 French titles, including six films, nine series and three documentaries.  It plans to produce several new shows over the coming years as well as a range of series and films made by production partners.  Netflix has seen its customer base grow quickly in recent years thanks to a rich catalog of movies and series, allowing it to grab market share from long-established local pay TV operator Canal+ - a unit of media conglomerate Vivendi - which had 16.2 million subscribers at the end of 2018, including 8.3 million in mainland France.  In an interview with French weekly L\u2019Express, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said his company now has 6.7 million subscribers in France and that the firm will invest more than 100 million euros to create new French-language content in 2020.  \u201cWe are becoming a major French producer, we are no longer just a machine to export Hollywood content,\u201d he said, adding that he was set to meet with French president Emmanuel Macron.  Among the new productions are the new film BigBug, a comedy set in the future co-written by \u201cAmelie\u201d director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and a series about gentleman-burglar Arsene Lupin, starring French actor Omar Sy.  Netflix\u2019s offensive follows the French government saying it would force platforms such as Netflix to dedicate up to 25% of their French revenue to fund domestic French content production.  Netflix has come under fire in France for disrupting a finely regulated system of subsidies meant to encourage production of French-language films and series.  \u201cLike Canal+, we recognize that we have obligations. But conversations about these are for later,\u201d Hastings said at an event in Paris on Friday, triggering laughter from the audience, which featured Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and French culture minister Franck Riester.  Asked by L\u2019Express whether Netflix would in future submit some of its productions in the annual Cannes Film Festival, Hastings said that in order to be admitted to Cannes, films need to be shown first in cinemas and then have to wait three years to be shown on streaming services.  \u201cOur subscribers cannot wait that long. If we can take part without having to release in cinemas first, we will come back,\u201d he said.  Netflix has more than 158 million paid memberships in over 190 countries, it said. The new French headquarters will be its fourth office in Europe.","158":"PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm at the center of the \"Panama Papers\" scandal, has filed a lawsuit against Netflix Inc NFLX.O over its new movie based on the case, accusing the video streaming company of defamation and seeking to stop the film's release.

Netflix\u2019s film \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d stars Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas as the two Mossack Fonseca partners at the center of the scandal, Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca. It is scheduled to be released on Friday.  \u201cIn its movie ...

The lawsuit was filed in U.S. federal court in Connecticut on Oct. 13. Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In the official trailer for \u201cThe Laundromat,\u201d which co-stars Meryl Streep as a widow investigating insurance fraud, the following question is asked and answered in big, bold type: \u201cHow do 15 million millionaires in 200 countries stay rich? With lawyers like these.\u201d  The trailer then cuts to the elegantly dressed lawyers played by Oldman and Banderas laughing uproariously.  Mossack Fonseca shut down last year after being accused by U.S. prosecutors of helping clients conceal assets, investments and income from government tax authorities using a wide range of sham foundations and shell companies.  While Jurgen Mossack did not respond to requests for comment, a source close to both lawyers told Reuters that they maintain their position that the massive leak of the firm\u2019s internal documents consisted of \u201cinformation theft or hacking\u201d that was illegal.

On Jan. 18 following its last quarterly results, Netflix dropped 4% over concerns about slowing growth, and investors are now focused on how Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings plans to fend off a major challenge from Walt Disney, with its upcoming Disney+ streaming service.  Disney\u2019s stock has surged 12% since it unveiled the service last week, which will be priced below Netflix and include some of the world\u2019s most popular entertainment franchises.

For the first quarter, Netflix has said here it expects to add 8.9 million global subscribers.  Analysts on average expect Netflix to report a 21.6% rise in quarterly revenue to $4.5 billion, which would be its most modest quarterly revenue increase since 2013, according to Refinitiv.

The plan, which includes nine productions in India and five anime series, should help ease concern that the video streaming pioneer is running out of space to expand in developed markets.  Netflix reported bumper quarterly earnings last month as it exceeded forecasts in both the U.S. and international markets, with the bulk of new subscribers coming from outside the United States where the company has been investing aggressively.  \u201cMore than half of Asian content hours viewed on Netflix this year are viewed outside the region,\u201d Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, said when unveiling the plan at the firm\u2019s content showcase event in Singapore.  \u201cSo we have confidence that our upcoming slate of Asian productions will find fans in their home countries and abroad.\u201d  Netflix has earmarked $8 billion for content this year, and had spent $6.9 billion as at the end of its third quarter.  On Thursday, the company said the new productions will include anime series such as Trese, based on a Philippine graphic novel of the same name, and Pacific Rim, an adventure story about two siblings searching for their missing parents.  Netflix will make two Thai language originals including Shimmers, a drama series about five teenagers at an isolated school in northern Thailand. It will also broadcast Triad Princess, a Chinese-language original from Taiwan in which the protagonist seeks independence in defiance of her Triad father.  The new titles build on Netflix\u2019s recent forays into Asian productions, including India\u2019s Sacred Games, Japanese anime series DEVILMAN crybaby, and variety comedy BUSTED! in South Korea.  In Asia, led by India, Netflix has won fans among a young, tech-savvy middle class. Chief Executive Reed Hastings has said India could deliver the service\u2019s next 100 million subscribers.  The company will announce details of nine projects from the country on Friday.  Netflix scored a hit in India with Mumbai-based crime thriller Sacred Games. However, the Bollywood studio that produced the show disbanded last month after sexual harassment allegations against one of its partners, Vikas Bahl, and the show\u2019s lead writer, Varun Grover. Both men have denied the allegations.  Netflix later backed the series for a second season.  The firm had 137 million subscribers to its movie and TV streaming service worldwide as of September-end. It began releasing original English-language programming nearly six years ago and has since expanded into other languages.","161":"LOS ANGELES, March 18 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc will not make its programming available through a coming TV service expected to be unveiled by Apple Inc, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on Monday.  \u201cWe prefer to let our customers watch our content on our service,\u201d Hastings told reporters at a briefing at the company\u2019s offices in Hollywood.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Five Republican U.S. senators urged Netflix this week to reconsider plans to adapt the book into a TV series because they said the author has defended the Chinese government\u2019s clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in the Xinjiang region.  \u201cThe Three-Body Problem\u201d and two sequels were written by Liu Cixin.  Netflix announced this month that it was turning the books into a live-action, English-language TV series led by D.B Weiss and David Benioff, the creators of HBO megahit \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d.  Liu serves as a consulting producer on the project.  \u201cMr. Liu is the author of the book not the creator of this show. We do not agree with his comments, which are entirely unrelated to his book or this Netflix show,\u201d said Netflix Global Public Policy Vice President Dean Garfield in a letter to the senators.  \u201cIf anything, the government is helping their economy and trying to lift them out of poverty,\u201d Liu told the New Yorker magazine in 2019.  \u201cIf you were to loosen up the country a bit, the consequences would be terrifying.\u201d  The senators also asked Netflix to reconsider the implications of providing a platform to Liu in producing this project.  The Netflix streaming service is available in more than 190 countries but does not operate in China.  The United States and human rights groups have criticized China\u2019s treatment of the Uighurs.

FILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is seen on their office building in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Under the partnership, Network18 affiliates - which include its joint venture with ViacomCBS, Viacom18 - would create shows for Netflix to help the U.S. firm expand offerings in India, where it competes against the video streaming services of Amazon.com Inc and Walt Disney Co.  A Netflix spokesman in India denied the company was in talks with Network18 or Viacom18, but did not elaborate. A spokeswoman for Viacom18 declined to comment on whether any talks were under way.  Shares in Network18 Media & Investments surged 5% after the Reuters article.  The financial terms of any potential partnership were not immediately clear and negotiations are still in the early stages, the sources said, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.  While the new shows will be used only by Netflix, that does not mean Network18 and its affiliates will stop creating shows for other platforms, said two of the three sources.  Viacom18 licences content to several platforms, including Amazon. In 2019, its digital unit Tipping Point partnered with Netflix for three Hindi-language shows, but two of the sources said the current discussions were about a much bigger tie-up over several years.  \u201cThis is a bigger version of the 2019 deal in essence,\u201d said the first source.  The second source described the ongoing discussions as one of Netflix\u2019s \u201cbiggest moves to create local content in India.\u201d  \u201cThe scale of Netflix\u2019s ambition and aspiration in India is quite high,\u201d said the source, adding that the deal could involve at least 10 shows, mainly in Hindi.  Network18 is controlled by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani through subsidiaries of his oil-to-telecoms conglomerate Reliance Industries.  In recent weeks, Reliance has secured nearly $13 billion in investments from Facebook Inc, KKR & Co and other investors into its digital unit Jio Platforms, which houses movie and music apps, and a telecoms venture.  Some Reliance executives are involved in the Netflix negotiations, two of the sources said. A spokesman at Reliance did not respond to a request for comment.  Netflix\u2019s Indian roster includes blockbuster originals such as \u201cSacred Games\u201d, a crime thriller set in Mumbai and starring some of Bollywood\u2019s biggest names. Its pricing is, however, higher than that of Amazon Prime Video and Disney-owned Hotstar.  Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said in December the company planned to invest nearly $400 million during 2019 and 2020 to develop content for Indian viewers.  Local-language shows are vital for Netflix\u2019s growth in India, which the company in 2018 said could deliver its next 100 million subscribers.  While a content deal would boost Netflix\u2019s offerings, it would also aid Network18 whose revenue has been hit as businesses cut back on advertising and other spending during the coronavirus lockdown, said one of the sources, adding: \u201cIt makes huge sense (for both companies).\u201d","164":"FILE PHOTO - The Netflix logo is seen on their office in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 16, 2018.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  WarnerMedia executives want \u201cCirce\u201d to unleash a different power: attracting young viewers to the company\u2019s belated entry in the streaming-video war.  HBO Max, which will be HBO plus movies, original shows, and TV classics such \u201cFriends,\u201d will be available starting this spring to 10 million AT&T customers who are also HBO subscribers in the United States at no extra charge, according to AT&T Chief Operating Officer John Stankey, who disclosed the figures for the first time in an interview with Reuters.  These are a portion of the customers that currently pay for an AT&T-owned product such as DirecTV or AT&T wireless phone service.  By 2025, AT&T aims to reach about 80 million global subscribers, with about 50 million in the United States, a source briefed on the plans told Reuters. They are ambitious targets that would be consistent with Netflix Inc's NFLX.O early progress, and in the mid-range of Disney+, Walt Disney Co's DIS.N Netflix rival, set to launch on Nov. 12.  WarnerMedia hopes this service will get a boost in 2021 when it launches an advertising-supported option at a lower cost, insiders said.  After it launches the ad-supported option, the company will add live programming on HBO Max.  A long-term goal for HBO Max is to help AT&T retain wireless subscribers, according to executives, and also allow the company to pair wireless and DirecTV satellite data to learn more about consumers -- and in turn, charge higher rates to advertisers.  As one of the final entries in the streaming wars, HBO Max faces a tough competitive landscape. Although the Warner Brothers archive includes thousands of films and TV series like \u201cThe Shining\u201d and \u201cScooby-Doo,\u201d it does not have the same brand awareness as Disney properties like Pixar or Marvel.  Price could also be an obstacle: HBO Max is likely to cost slightly more than the $14.99 the company charges for HBO -- significantly more than competing services from Apple Inc AAPL.O ($4.99) and Disney ($6.99), and slightly higher than the standard $12.99 Netflix plan.  Selling HBO Max by piggybacking off the entrenched HBO service has its own challenges. Stankey wants to convert HBO\u2019s 35 million U.S. subscriber base, which includes the 10 million customers AT&T controls, to HBO Max. Doing so involves renegotiating deals with current pay TV providers, who may be wary of helping AT&T snatch their video customers.  And while AT&T executives believe that HBO Max could reduce churn on its cell phone business to boost profits, the link may not be that clear.  \u201cAT&T hasn\u2019t seen any more improvement (in churn) with wireless\/video bundling than Verizon has seen without it,\u201d said MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett.  PATH TO GROWTH  AT&T, saddled with $162 billion in debt, faces a litany of challenges. Activist investor Elliott Management has expressed skepticism about Stankey, considered the heir apparent to CEO Randall Stephenson.  Elliott is pressuring AT&T to justify its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner -- now called WarnerMedia -- which it finalized in February, and to consider unwinding its $48.5 billion purchase of DirecTV, which has rapidly bled subscribers.  \u201cThe success of HBO Max is built on the ability for the company to rationalize why (the companies that AT&T bought) all belong together,\u201d said Stankey earlier this month.  WarnerMedia will announce HBO Max pricing and details on Oct. 29. In interviews with Reuters, Stankey and Robert Greenblatt, chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment and Direct-to-Consumer, spelled out a plan to aggressively expand HBO\u2019s base.  The key to that growth is to continue providing content in the style of HBO -- the company defines that as \u201cquality\u201d; industry watchers invariably say \u201csexy\u201d or \u201cedgy\u201d -- to its current over-40 viewers, while expanding to a younger audience that is used to streaming content and does not want to pay for cable.  \u201cWe know there\u2019s 75 million people in the range from two to young adults that are available to us as potential new subscribers that aren\u2019t part of the HBO universe already,\u201d said Greenblatt.  That focus explains the investment in shows like \u201cCirce\u201d; a \u201cGremlins\u201d animated series; and a reboot of \u201cGossip Girl\u201d that will appeal to the under-40 crowd.  WarnerMedia is also investing in children\u2019s content and will feature \u201cSesame Street\u201d on HBO Max.  Even as it expands beyond traditional HBO programming, executives want to position the new service as something different from Netflix, which AT&T\u2019s Stephenson likened to Walmart at a 2018 investor conference. They use a variety of euphemisms to make that distinction: from \u201cthoughtfully curated\u201d to \u201cNot a Walmart\u201d to \u201cPremium.\u201d They bristle at \u201cgeneral interest.\u201d  Another opportunity to expand is by promoting HBO Max to DirecTV customers who do not already subscribe to HBO. \u201cWe didn\u2019t buy DirecTV because we love satellite,\u201d said Stankey. \u201cWe bought DirecTV because we love the customer base and the customer base could be migrated into more on-demand-oriented products and services.\u201d  Stankey also hinted at the possibility of bundling HBO Max with AT&T wireless subscriptions. T-Mobile gives away Netflix to some customers, and Verizon is providing a free year of Disney+ to some customers.  On Tuesday Stankey, Greenblatt and others will reveal their plans to investors, on the same stage where Warner Brothers shot actress Judy Garland\u2019s comeback film \u201cA Star is Born.\u201d  Their performance will help determine AT&T\u2019s future.","167":"The Netflix logo is pictured on a television in this illustration photograph taken in Encinitas, California, U.S., January 18, 2017.

The results for July through September represented a rebound from the previous quarter when Netflix lost U.S. streaming customers for the first time in eight years and missed targets for overseas subscribers. Shares of Netflix rose 9.2% in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $312.69.  That performance, combined with concerns about new competitors, had weighed on Netflix shares, which had fallen 21% from the last earnings report through regular trading on Wednesday.  For the third quarter, Netflix was boosted by new seasons of shows such as \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201c13 Reasons Why.\u201d The company added 6.77 million paid customers around the globe, topping the nearly 6.7 million average expectation of analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

But it will face new competition starting in November from Disney+, a streaming service from Walt Disney Co DIS.N that will be stocked with movies and TV shows from Disney's popular Marvel, \"Star Wars,\" animation and other properties.  Apple Inc AAPL.O also will debut a much smaller streaming video service with original programming in November. AT&T Inc's T.N HBO Max, and a new offering from Comcast Corp CMCSA.O, are expected to enter the market next year.  Netflix argued that the new services would increase interest in the streaming video market broadly.  \u201cIn our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment,\u201d the company wrote in a letter to investors.

The debt that Netflix has amassed has sparked concern among some investors. The company said in the earnings report that it expected free cash flow to improve in 2020 and annually beyond that. In the meantime, Netflix will continue to tap the high-yield market as needed, it said.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - For Netflix investors, reality bites. Netflix\u2019s subscriber growth is slowing, and boss Reed Hastings has decided to share his chief executive role. That was enough to knock around 10% off the streaming service\u2019s stock in after-hours trading on Thursday. But even after a 60% share price rise this year, well ahead of Facebook, Alphabet and Apple, Netflix is still the sharpest FAANG.  The $230 billion firm added more than 10 million subscribers during the second quarter, compared with analyst estimates of 8 million, according to Refinitiv. The problem is that momentum is flagging as people emerge from lockdowns. Netflix reckons it will hook just under 3 million more net subscribers by the end of September. That made Thursday a poor time to announce the elevation of Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos to the clunky position of co-CEO. What\u2019s arguably sensible succession planning \u2013 Sarandos is one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood \u2013 can also look from the outside like a founder getting ready to follow other pursuits.  Still, it\u2019s mainly a story of high expectations. Netflix\u2019s stock this year has surpassed other high-flying tech kin Facebook, Apple and Alphabet, whose search engine Google gives the FAANGs their \u201cG\u201d. Only Amazon.com, which has proved an essential service during the pandemic, rivals Netflix\u2019s rise. And some correction may be healthy. The company trades at 67 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months. If Covid-19 hadn\u2019t virtually stopped production, Netflix would have burned cash this quarter, and for at least the next year.  True, customers have expanding choice, which makes it harder to garner new eyeballs. Sport franchises are preparing to get back into action. The U.S. National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball intend to air games soon. And rival services are finally getting off the ground. Comcast launched its streaming service Peacock on Wednesday. AT&T unveiled HBO Max in May. Unlike other FAANGs, Netflix hasn\u2019t aroused the ire of antitrust watchdogs, but that\u2019s because it lacks their obvious dominance.  Even so, Hastings\u2019 firm has gained ground that it\u2019s unlikely to give up. A looming recession, or slow recovery, could lead consumers to cut back on spending, but it\u2019s not Netflix that will lose from that. A survey conducted for MoffettNathanson found that tight finances are the top reason people ditch pay-TV \u2013 and pick up streaming services like Netflix. Hastings\u2019 creation still hasn\u2019t lost its bite.","170":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Netflix Inc, Amazon.com Inc and technology companies poised to benefit from U.S. corporate tax cuts are attracting fresh attention on Wall Street after their shares shrugged off recent market turbulence.  FILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is pictured on a television in this illustration photograph taken in Encinitas, California, U.S., on January 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Amazon on Wednesday rose over 2 percent and touched $1,500 for the first time, while Netflix rose also rose over 2 percent and nearly hit its own record high.  Investors, left nervous after major indexes slumped into correction territory at the start of the month but still confident about the health of the U.S. economy, are doubling down on already popular companies expected to post above-average earnings growth. Many of those are businesses poised to benefit from consumers and companies with more money to spend and invest as a result of U.S. tax cuts enacted this year.  Among such stocks, Amazon has climbed 2.7 percent since the end of January and Netflix has increased 4.9 percent, both outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 3.3 percent decline.  \u201cInvestors are willing to pay a premium for go-go tech stocks that can deliver returns in any environment,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. \u201cPeople are going to stay home and eat popcorn and watch movies on Netflix no matter what.\u201d  Analysts on average expect Amazon to increase its adjusted, non-GAAP earnings per share by 82 percent this year. Netflix\u2019s earnings per share are expected to more than triple, according to Thomson Reuters data.  That compares with expectations for S&P 500 aggregate earnings to expand by an unusually strong 19.1 percent in 2018, helped by a tax cuts and a stronger economy, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  In terms of their earnings valuations, Amazon and Netflix appear exceptionally expensive compared with most stocks. Amazon recently traded at 155 times earnings expected over the next 12 months, while Netflix traded at 94 times expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.  As the dust settles from the sell-off earlier this month, investors also remain optimistic about the technology sector. After leading last year\u2019s stock market rally, the S&P 500 information technology index in 2018 is in a neck-and-neck lead with consumer discretionary, both about 4.9 percent higher year to date. Amazon is the most heavily weighted stock in the consumer discretionary index and accounted for much of its gain.  Following earnings growth of 20.5 percent for 2017, the S&P information technology sector is expected by analysts to expand its earnings by another 17.1 percent this year.  Overall S&P 500 earnings grew about 12.8 percent in 2017 and are seen increasing another 17.9 percent this year.  While analysts have increased their earnings estimates for hundreds of companies to account for new tax cuts, investors still lack a clear picture of how companies will spend their windfalls. Some companies may reinvest it, including spending on technology like cloud computing and cyber security.  Wedbush trader Joel Kulina said many clients who rode last year\u2019s rally in semiconductor stocks are turning to cloud and cybersecurity sellers.  \u201cRight now, they are the most favored pick in tech, whether it\u2019s Salesforce or Workday or IT security names like Proofpoint or New Relic,\u201d Kulina said. \u201cPeople think that no matter what happens, these companies are still going to benefit from more companies spending from the tax cuts.\u201d  King Lip, chief investment strategist at San Francisco-based Baker Avenue Asset Management, said Salesforce.com, which sells customer relationship management software, is his top pick in cloud computing, as well as a central technology at his own company.  \u201cWe can\u2019t imagine having to change our CRM system. They have built a business that is so sticky that once you are on Salesforce, you\u2019re almost not going to ever change,\u201d Lip said.

The streaming service, which films TV shows like crime drama \u201cOzark\u201d and supernatural thriller \u201cStranger Things\u201d in the U.S. state, said it would work with groups fighting the Georgia law through the U.S. courts.  It was the first major Hollywood producer to publicly comment on calls by some for an industry boycott of Georgia, a hub for film and television production.  \u201cWe have many women working on productions in Georgia, whose rights, along with millions of others, will be severely restricted by this law,\u201d Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, said in a statement.  \u201cIt\u2019s why we will work with the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) and others to fight it in court. Given the legislation has not yet been implemented, we\u2019ll continue to film there - while also supporting partners and artists who choose not to. Should it ever come into effect, we\u2019d rethink our entire investment in Georgia,\u201d Sarandos added.  Georgia\u2019s Republican governor signed into law on May 7 a ban on abortion after a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat - about six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. The law is due to take effect on Jan. 1.  Georgia is one of eight states to pass anti-abortion legislation this year for the purpose of inducing the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark case that established a woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy.  Some Hollywood figures have called for a boycott of Georgia while others have said they will donate money to local groups fighting the abortion law. Most Hollywood studios and platforms have not commented on their plans.  According to the Georgia film office website on Monday, 38 movies or TV shows are currently in production in the state. Past productions include TV series \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d  The makers of an upcoming comedy starring Kristen Wig decided last week not to shoot in Georgia in the light of the abortion law.  Work on \u201cOzark\u201d season three began in Georgia earlier this month. Star and executive producer Jason Bateman said that if the abortion bill became law he would not work in Georgia \u201cor any other state that is so disgracefully at odds with women\u2019s rights.\u201d (Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)","172":"(Adds remarks from the stage; Obamas not in attendance)  LOS ANGELES, Feb 9 (Reuters) - \u201cAmerican Factory,\u201d a Netflix film from Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s nascent production house chronicling what happened to a group of Ohio autoworkers laid off during the 2008 recession, won the Oscar for best documentary feature on Sunday.  The documentary, directed by filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar, was the first release from Higher Ground Productions, a company the former U.S. president and first lady formed in 2018 in a multi-year collaboration with the Netflix streaming service.  \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d was acquired by Netflix in association with Higher Ground out of the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, where it was awarded the U.S. documentary directing prize.  The film, examining themes of economic dislocation and clashing cultures, traces the experience of workers in Moraine, Ohio, who lost their jobs at a shuttered General Motors factory only to be rehired six years later after the facility was converted into a Chinese-owned automotive glass plant. \u201cOur film is from Ohio and China ... but it really could be from anywhere that people put on a uniform, punch a clock, try to make their families have a better life,\u201d Reichert said in accepting the award.  \u201cWorking people have it harder and harder these days, and we believe that things will get better when workers of the world unite,\u201d she added, evoking the famed Marxist rallying cry from \u201cThe Communist Manifesto.\u201d  Neither of the Obamas attended Sunday\u2019s ceremony, but Bognar mentioned Higher Ground Productions in his thank-yous from the stage.  \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d triumphed over a field of contenders that included \u201cThe Cave\u201d and \u201cFor Sama,\u201d two documentaries about the civil war in Syria, as well as \u201cThe Edge of Democracy,\u201d which chronicles the unraveling of two Brazilian presidencies, and \u201cHoneyland,\u201d about ancient beekeeping traditions in the mountains of Macedonia.  The production deal between the Obamas and Netflix is a first for any former occupant of the White House.

FILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is pictured on a television in this illustration photograph taken in Encinitas, California, U.S., January 18, 2017.

But like other U.S. entertainment firms, it has identified the need to create local content as important in winning viewers in some of the big emerging markets which are likely to dominate growth over the next decade.  A Hindi-language thriller set in Mumbai, \"Sacred Games\" launches less than a month after the success of its Indian film \"Lust Stories\" and comes at a time when fellow U.S. heavyweights Comcast Corp CMCSA.O and Walt Disney Co DIS.N are vying for control of Indian pay TV network Tata Sky as part of their fight for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O.  Both \u201cLust Stories\u201d and \u201cSacred Games\u201d seek to marry the Western styles and values that exposure to Netflix and Amazon has brought to younger Indians with the rich and varied output of the country\u2019s massive domestic film industry.  Netflix is spending $8 billion this year on original content and has said that figure will rise as it seeks to cement its position at the head of the streaming industry globally. The company\u2019s international streaming revenue grew over 58 percent last year, according to latest filings. With China\u2019s heavily censored market proving a hard nut to crack, India is at the heart of that growth. Netflix plans to release another three original shows there this year compared to Amazon\u2019s planned 10 while both have also been battling to sign some of the country\u2019s leading stand-ups for specials.  An action-driven police procedural that will also be familiar to foreign viewers, \u201cSacred Games\u201d is anchored by Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan as a policeman with 25 days to head off a terrorist threat to Mumbai. It is directed by Bollywood veteran Anurag Kashyap and also stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte.  \u201cSacred Games\u201d outlines the life of a police officer, Sartaj Singh, tipped by an anonymous call one morning promising him an opportunity to capture the powerful criminal Ganesh Gaitonde.  As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that there is a lot more at stake in the game than initially seemed.  The film\u2019s stars and directors, all well known veterans of India\u2019s huge Bollywood film system, greeted more than 250 specially invited Netflix fans and celebrities outside tech capital Bengaluru\u2019s Forum Mall for the premiere.","174":"(Reuters) - Viacom Inc VIAB.O on Friday announced a multi-picture deal with Netflix NFLX.O, and promised to make more films and TV shows for other companies, further signaling that it will not directly take on big tech rivals that stream to consumers and will instead supply them with content.  The Viacom office is seen in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, April 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  This strategy and the strength of the Tom Cruise-helmed \u201cMission: Impossible - Fallout\u201d at the box office helped Viacom beat profit and revenue expectations in the quarter ended Sept. 30.  As media giants Walt Disney Co DIS.N and AT&T Inc T.N mobilize their extensive film and TV libraries to launch rivals to Netflix and Amazon.com's AMZN.O Prime, smaller companies such as Viacom and sister company CBS Corp CBS.N are redoubling efforts to become original content resources for other distributors.  \u201cAll of the recent activity around vertical integration only serves the demand for high quality producers,\u201d Viacom Chief Executive Bob Bakish said on a post-earnings conference call. His comments were similar to those of CBS interim CEO Joe Ianniello earlier this month.  Viacom\u2019s new film deal with Netflix expands upon other work it has done for the world\u2019s biggest streaming video service, including TV series \u201cThe Haunting of Hill House\u201d and \u201cManiac,\u201d which stars Emma Stone and Jonah Hill.  Jim Gianopulos, CEO of Viacom\u2019s Paramount Pictures, said the company saw plenty of opportunities to expand the size of its film and TV production business as buyers\u2019 \u201cappetite continues to increase.\u201d Its slate of TV shows will grow by close to 50 percent next year to 13 shows.  Revenue from TV production across Viacom, owner of cable networks MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, is expected to double to about $1 billion in a couple of years, executives said.  They also said overall company revenue in fiscal 2019, which began Oct. 1, will rise by mid-single digit percentages, driven by growth from both TV and films. Adjusted operating income will rise in the low-single digital percentage range, they said.  Merger?  The upbeat quarterly results and the Netflix deal boosted the company\u2019s shares, which were up 2.1 percent at $32.50 in mid-day trading on the Nasdaq.  The results are a welcome respite from two years of turmoil over Viacom\u2019s future as a stand-alone company or part of a larger player in a merger with CBS.  An attempted merger of Viacom and CBS earlier this year fell apart over disagreements about executive management. Shari Redstone and National Amusements Inc, controlling shareholders of the two companies, ultimately settled a lawsuit brought by CBS to block the merger, with Redstone agreeing to refrain from proposing a merger of CBS and Viacom for two years.  However, people close to the companies expect others to rekindle merger discussions well before the standstill expires.  Long-time CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves, who led opposition of a merger, stepped down in September following allegations of sexual harassment.  Since taking charge in 2016, Viacom\u2019s Bakish has focused on Paramount and the company\u2019s cable TV business, which like its peers has been losing subscribers in the face of competition from Netflix and Prime.  On an adjusted basis, Viacom earned 99 cents per share on revenue of $3.49 billion.  Analysts on average expected a profit of 95 cents per share and revenue of $3.37 billion.","175":"Jan 14 (Reuters) - NBCUniversal, a unit of U.S. cable group Comcast Corp, said on Monday it planned to launch a streaming service in early 2020, stepping into a market dominated by Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.

The British actress spent time with pregnant women and those who had suffered stillbirths or miscarriages while preparing for a role that she said scared her with the weight of its responsibility. One woman allowed Kirby to be present at the birth of her child.  \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about labor. And I definitely didn\u2019t know anything about losing a baby.

But that growth has come at the cost of a rising debt pile - its long-term debt at the end of 2018 rose to a staggering $10.36 billion from $3.36 billion in 2016.  Wedbush analysts, however, said that if \u201cNetflix is able to improve its free cash flow by $1 billion per year, it will see its debt peak at $13 billion, and will be debt free in 2026\u201d.

From the movie version of rap-infused musical \u201cHamilton\u201d to LGBTQ musical \u201cThe Prom\u201d and director nods for three women, the nominations - which kick off the Hollywood awards season - recognized social justice issues and performers of color in an industry that critics have long complained is dominated by white men.  The contest for the best drama movie will also include modern Great Recession story \u201cNomadland,\u201d 1960s Vietnam War protest drama \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7,\u201d #MeToo revenge fantasy \u201cPromising Young Woman,\u201d and family drama \u201cThe Father\u201d about aging.  Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s satire on former President Donald Trump\u2019s America, \u201cBorat Subsequent Moviefilm;\u201d \u201cHamilton;\u201d \u201cThe Prom;\u201d autism story \u201cMusic\u201d and time-loop comedy \u201cPalm Springs\u201d will compete in a separate category for musicals and comedies.  For television, British royal family series \u201cThe Crown,\u201d whose season focused on the late Princess Diana, led the way with six nods including for most of its main cast, followed by quirky small-town comedy \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek.\u201d  Netflix Inc beat all comers in both film, with 22 nods, and television, with 20. The tally followed a year in which the coronavirus pandemic led Hollywood studios to push back dozens of their film releases or put them on streaming services.  Amazon Studios got seven nominations in the movie field.  Three of the five directors nominated on Wednesday were women, including Regina King for the story of a meeting of four Black icons in the 1960s in \u201cOne Night in Miami,\u201d Britain\u2019s Emerald Fennell for \u201cPromising Young Woman\u201d and Chinese-born filmmaker Chloe Zhao for \u201cNomadland.\u201d  Variety calculated that a record 30% of the acting nominees in the film categories were non-white.  They included Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman, in his last film role, in jazz period piece \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom,\u201d British-Pakistani actor Riz Ahmed as a drummer going deaf in \u201cSound of Metal,\u201d Andra Day for her role in \u201cThe United States Vs Billie Holiday,\u201d and Dev Patel for the modern twist on Charles Dickens \u201cThe Personal History of David Copperfield.\u201d  \u201cWithout question, things are changing,\u201d said actor Leslie Odom Jr., who was involved in \u201cHamilton,\u201d \u201cMusic\u201d and \u201cOne Night in Miami\u201d where he played Black singer Sam Cooke.  \u201cThe table is getting longer, the room is getting larger, and the lens is finding new people and new interesting stories to tell,\u201d Odom said in a phone interview.  The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which selects the nominees and winners, is known for its sometimes quirky choices and this year was no exception. Spike Lee\u2019s Vietnam War drama \u201cDa 5 Bloods\u201d was shut out completely, the little-seen \u201cMusic\u201d got two nods and perennial favorite Meryl Streep was excluded while her \u201cThe Prom\u201d co-star James Corden was among the nominees.  The Golden Globes are to be handed out at a virtual ceremony on Feb. 28, hosted by actors Tina Fey in New York and Amy Poehler in Los Angeles.  \u201cDespite a stressed pandemic year, there is a comfort of sorts in embracing traditions,\u201d said \u201cMank\u201d star Gary Oldman of the ceremony.  It was a good day for Baron Cohen, who won nominations both for his \u201cBorat\u201d sequel and for his supporting role as a counter culture leader in \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7.\u201d  \u201cThese two films are different, but they share a common theme: sometimes we have to protest injustice with our own farce,\u201d Baron Cohen said in a statement.

FILE PHOTO: 2017 MTV Movie and TV Awards - Show \u2013 Los Angeles, U.S., 07\/05\/2017 \u2013 Cast of \"13 Reasons Why\" presents Show of the Year. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni\/File Photo  The researchers said the study had limitations and they could not make a direct causal link between \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d and the increase in suicide rates or rule out other factors. Another, previous study had found watching the program was associated with a reduced risk of self-harm for some young adults.  The rate of suicide in April 2017 was 28.9 percent higher among U.S. youth ages 10 to 17 than would be expected based on suicide counts and trends observed in previous years, the National Institutes of Health-supported (NIH) study said on Monday.  It found rates of suicide for 10- to 17-year-olds were also higher in the rest of the year, resulting in an additional estimated 195 suicide deaths from April to December 2017 versus expectations based on past data. The increase was driven primarily by young boys, they said.  A Netflix spokesman said the company had just seen the study and was reviewing it.  \u201cIt\u2019s a critically important topic, and we have worked hard to ensure that we handle this sensitive issue responsibly,\u201d the Netflix spokesman said.  The spokesman also said the research conflicted with a recent finding by a team at the University of Pennsylvania.  In a survey of 18- to 29-year-olds, the Pennsylvania researchers found students who watched all of season two of \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d were less likely to report self-harm and suicidal thoughts than others who did not watch the series at all.  The show tells the story of a teen who leaves behind a series of 13 tapes describing why she decided to take her own life. The first season\u2019s final episode depicted her slitting her wrists in a bathtub.  The graphic scene caused a backlash among parents and health professionals, prompting Netflix in 2017 to put up additional viewer warnings and direct viewers to support groups.  A second season was released in May 2018 and a third season has been ordered by Netflix.  Chief Executive Reed Hastings defended the third season renewal at a shareholder meeting in June 2018.  \u201c\u201813 Reasons Why\u2019 has been enormously popular and successful. It\u2019s engaging content. It is controversial. But nobody has to watch it,\u201d Hastings said.  The NIH-backed researchers said their findings \u201cshould serve as a reminder to be mindful of the possible unintended impacts of the portrayal of suicide, and as a call to the entertainment industry and the media to use best practices when engaging with this topic.\u201d  The study was conducted at several universities, hospitals, and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), part of the U.S. government\u2019s National Institutes of Health. NIMH also funded the study.","189":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Netflix Inc NFLX.O on Monday announced plans to launch a new Top 10 feature that will allow users to see the most popular TV series and films in their country.  The Los Gatos, California, company has guarded its viewership data for years and only recently started revealing information about how many people watch its shows.  Director of Product Innovation Cameron Johnson wrote in a company blog post here that Netflix will update the Top 10 feature daily. It will include an overall top 10 list as well as lists for the most popular TV series and films.  Shows that make these lists will be designated with a \u201cTop 10\u201d badge elsewhere on the platform. The streaming giant has been experimenting with top 10 lists in Mexico and the United Kingdom for the last six months, wrote Johnson.  Netflix uses an algorithm to serve up content based on a user\u2019s viewing history, but still faces criticism that it is difficult to browse. The Top 10 list addresses that criticism, and also reflects a trend by the company to be more transparent about how its shows are performing.  In December Netflix released a list of its most popular shows and films of 2019 in the United States, based on the number of households watching at least two minutes of a series, movie or special during its first 28 days on the service.

Netflix shares fell about 11% on worries about its earnings report on Wednesday that showed lower-than-expected global growth and signs of trouble in its U.S. base ahead of Walt Disney Co's DIS.N much-awaited launch of a rival service later this year.  Netflix, whose price-to-earnings ratio is by far the largest of the five big U.S. tech companies making up the so-called FAANG group, has quadrupled in value since 2015 but at $321 per share is down $100 from 2018 peaks. The other FAANG companies are Facebook Inc FB.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O and Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O.  The April-to-June period tends to be seasonally weak for Netflix in the United States, where warmer weather and longer days keep viewers outdoors.  Brokers Cowen & Co said Netflix had missed expectations for second-quarter subscriber numbers three times in the last four years. This year, however, the Los Gatos, California-based company set a series of aggressive price hikes, and lost U.S. subscribers for the first time in eight years.  \u201cThey raised prices in the U.S. by an average of $2 per month, and most subscribers learned about their increase during Q2,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.  \u201cI think that was a much bigger driver of churn than a dearth of content.\u201d  STILL A BUY  Ten Wall Street brokerages cut their share price targets to reflect Thursday\u2019s fall, but did not downgrade the stock, still seen by a majority of Wall Street firms as a high-potential growth business and a clear \u201cbuy\u201d.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  The relatively small price drop in the company\u2019s $12.6 billion of junk bonds affirmed the view that the second-quarter results are a blip. While all Netflix debt weakened on Thursday, the biggest price moves were just 2.5%, like on the 6.375% bond coming due in May 2029 worth $800 million, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cWe\u2019re not concerned. We\u2019re still keeping to our forecast,\u201d said Neil Begley, senior vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service.  The credit market\u2019s faith in Netflix has allowed it to borrow at very cheap rates to fund content creation and acquisition. That is unlikely to change based on the disappointing second-quarter results, said Begley.  Netflix bond prices did not fall enough to attract bargain hunters. \u201cI\u2019d be looking for a 300 basis point spread or so in a new 10-year deal as fair value,\u201d said John McClain, portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management. The spread on the 6.375% bond due in 2029 is around 275, he noted, \u201cso I\u2019d want a 325 basis point spread to get interested.\u201d  While competition is set to heat up with the upcoming launches of Apple TV and Disney+, several analysts said Netflix\u2019s global reach is likely to give it an edge.  Netflix added just 2.83 million international paid streaming subscribers, compared with Street expectations of 4.8 million, but it now has 151.6 million worldwide, dwarfing its nearest rivals Amazon Prime and HBO.  \u201cBy 2025, based on Disney projections, it looks like Netflix will be spending at least five times as much on content as Disney+,\u201d said Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak.  \u201cI also think Disney+ is likely to help accelerate consumers away from traditional Pay TV toward OTT (content over an internet connection) which should benefit Netflix.\u201d  The company raised prices in Britain, Switzerland, Greece and Western Europe in the quarter, testing the waters in some of its wealthiest markets at a time when it is still spending massively more than it earns to win the content battle.  Netflix began the third quarter with the release of its 1980s-set smash-hit \u201cStranger Things\u201d and will follow with new seasons of \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d and \u201cThe Crown,\u201d as well as the eagerly awaited Martin Scorsese movie \u201cThe Irishman.\u201d  \u201cWe would note Netflix misses have been followed by strong quarters, and, along those lines, we expect Netflix\u2019s very strong 2H slate will lead to a rebound in sub growth,\u201d Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a client note.","191":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix NFLX.O divorce drama \"Marriage Story\" on Monday led a Golden Globes nominations list dominated by movie stories about white men and marked by snubs for actor Robert De Niro and television shows \"Game of Thrones\" and social justice drama \"When They See Us.\"  \u201cMarriage Story\u201d scored six nods, including best drama and for actors Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson and Laura Dern.

The move, which the company said was aimed at funding a broad spread of activities including paying for new content, spurred falls in both the prices of its bonds and its shares as investors worried about the growing costs of its huge planned investments in years to come.  Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings has been explicit about the Los Gatos, California-based company\u2019s plan to fund content acquisition by raising debt. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to finance our capital needs in the high-yield market,\u201d Hastings wrote in his second-quarter shareholder letter.

The company had already spent $6.9 billion on TV shows and movies by the end of its third quarter, suggesting that if they continue apace, their 2018 spending is likely to be closer to $9 billion.  Netflix in April sold $1.6 billion in debt, after raising $1.9 billion in November 2017, bringing their total debt to $8.4 billion, the majority of which has been raised in the past three years. Its long-term debt as a percentage of total capital has roughly doubled to 65 percent since the end of 2014.  Bumper quarterly results last week, driven by gains in international subscribers, again eased concerns that the leader in global streaming is running out of space to expand in developed markets where it can target a mass audience at profitable prices.  But while Netflix still has huge potential in emerging markets like India, some brokerages have begun to draw attention to the overall high cost it is paying as an enterprise to gain more users.

Prices on Netflix\u2019s existing debt dropped across the board on Monday, with the biggest drops in a bond coming due in 2026, down by about 3 cents to 91.5 cents on the dollar.  Its eurobond coming due in 2028 also dropped nearly 3 cents to 91.95 cents on the dollar.

That shows most have now given it the benefit of the doubt on a shortfall in subscriber numbers in the second quarter, and the company has also cut its projection for negative cash flow to closer to $3 billion from a previously projected minus $4 billion.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Moody\u2019s Investors Service has assigned a rating of Ba3 to the new notes, three notches into junk territory, which is the same rating the agency has given the company as a whole.  Standard & Poor\u2019s rated the proposed debt issue at \u2018BB-\u2019 and \u20183\u2019 recovery rating. The recovery rating indicates a meaningful recovery of about 65 percent of principal in the event of a payment default.  It said the rating reflected the company\u2019s improving underlying profit margins over the last 12 months, driven in part by price increases and subscriber growth.  \u201cThese factors demonstrate the strength of the company\u2019s business model and its ability to expand globally, increase margins and manage its increasing debt burden,\u201d S&P said.

But in India, Hastings said, \u201cwe see the typical mix across these three plans that we see in many other countries like the U.S., which would indicate that we don\u2019t have a pricing issue. Because if it was, everyone would be on the lower price plan.\u201d  When asked directly if that meant the company had no plans for lower prices in India, he said: \u201cCorrect.\u201d  Hastings\u2019 comments followed a Singapore event where the company introduced 17 new original productions for Asia, including nine for India. He said local production was a key driver of new subscribers in India and elsewhere, but he declined to provide specific figures on Asia subscriber numbers and growth.  Netflix launched in India two years ago and has won fans among a young, tech-savvy middle class in a country where video consumption of all kinds is soaring. It scored a big hit in July with the release of \u201cSacred Games\u201d, a hard-boiled thriller built around Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan.  Local industry players, however, say Netflix\u2019s prices will make it hard to compete against domestic competitors like 21st Century Fox-backed Hotstar DIS.N, Amazon's AMZN.O Prime Video and satellite TV provider Tata Sky.  But Hastings said Netflix could still thrive amid cheaper options.  \u201cNow it is true that Youtube is free, and Amazon is basically free, and cable is extremely inexpensive because it\u2019s ad-supported. To some degree that creates a consumer expectation,\u201d he said. But he added that the cost of Netflix in India was \u201clike going to the movie theater 2-3 tickets a month, but you get to watch a lot more.\u201d  PRICING EXPERIMENTS  Following Netflix\u2019s October earnings announcement, chief product officer Greg Peters said: \u201cWe\u2019ll experiment with other pricing models, not only for India, but around the world that will allow us to broaden access by providing a pricing tier that sits below our current lowest tier.\u201d  That was widely understood to signal that a low-price plan was coming to India. But Hastings said that was not the case.  \u201cIt got misunderstood as a decision that we are going to have lower prices in India, which is not something we are particularly contemplating,\u201d he said.  Hastings acknowledged the limitations of the current pricing strategy in a country where per-capita income is a tenth of that in the United States.  \u201cIt\u2019s true that if you\u2019re trying to get to a billion households, that probably wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re focused on English-language, English-entertainment households, there is a much higher income.\u201d  He called the high-end focus \u201ca practical, realistic\u201d place to start and that the company eventually hoped to target a broader audience.  Netflix currently has more than 130 million subscribers worldwide. Hastings has said the India market could deliver the next 100 million subscribers.","199":"(Reuters) - The annual Emmy Awards, celebrating the best in television, were handed out on Sunday in a virtual ceremony hosted by Jimmy Kimmel from Los Angeles.

REUTERS\/Gonzalo Fuentes  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Netflix has managed to pull off the double axel of retail. The $145 billion streaming-video company has both the scale of shopping giant Walmart and the pricing power of luxury-jewelry outfit Tiffany. Chief Executive Reed Hastings\u2019 next trick is to work out how to maintain both labels.  Netflix added just over 1 million new U.S. subscribers last quarter, compared with an estimated 674,000, according to I\/B\/E\/S\/ data from Refinitiv. Its worldwide tally is 130 million members. Such success comes despite occasionally hiking the price of its monthly streaming service \u2013 most recently a year ago. It\u2019s also a sign Netflix is turning out a desirable collection of its own movies and TV series. And the increase is reassuring after Netflix missed its target in the second quarter, which sent its stock plummeting.  There are lingering concerns, though. Netflix is spending billions of dollars on content that appeals to its subscribers. The firm signaled it will burn around $3 billion in cash this year and last week bought a production studio in New Mexico to ramp up its own series like critically acclaimed \u201cStranger Things.\u201d  The competition continues to intensify, too. Rival media firms like Walt Disney wised up to the competitive threat and have pulled fare like the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise from Netflix as it readies its own direct-to-consumer products.  Even Walmart is looking to capitalize on the on-demand video service that it acquired in 2010, recently striking a partnership with MGM. Chief Executive Doug McMillon told Walmart investors on Tuesday that it was an opportunity to improve customer offerings without forking over a ton of money.  Keeping a tight hold on the purse strings will be tough in the current media environment. Disney is spending a whopping $71 billion for Twenty-First Century Fox\u2019s entertainment and international assets after Rupert Murdoch realized it was better to sell than to try to compete against Netflix. AT&T is another case study, having spent $85 billion for Time Warner.  In fact it was the telecom firm\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, who at a different investor conference last month first drew the comparison between jewelers, mega-stores and entertainment. He called AT&T\u2019s newly acquired HBO the Tiffany of streaming video due to quality shows like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d while describing Netflix as Walmart. He\u2019s half right.","201":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In March, noted short-seller Andrew Left took a swipe at Netflix Inc\u2019s stock, calling the online video company\u2019s aggressive spending on content acquisition \u201cunsustainable.\u201d  The Netflix logo is seen on their office in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  The stock took a brief dive on the Citron Research chief\u2019s assertion, but the volume of bets against it has since dropped to the lowest in at least half a decade.  Netflix bonds are a different story.  Bearish bets against the company\u2019s $8.4 billion of junk-rated bonds have more than tripled this year to an all-time high of $347 million, according to data from Samuel Pierson, analyst at IHS Markit.  \u201cThe short balance in the actual bonds reflects a view that (the bonds) will decline in value if or when they issue more debt,\u201d he said.  That is likely with growing competition between video-streaming services. Such platforms, including deep-pocketed rivals like Amazon Prime, AT&T Inc\u2019s HBO Go and Hulu - whose biggest backer is Walt Disney Co - have spent billions to acquire the rights to TV shows and movies and to make their own.  In 2017, Netflix spent $7 billion on content and has estimated an increase to $8 billion in 2018. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to finance our capital needs in the high-yield market,\u201d Chief Executive Reed Hastings wrote in his second-quarter shareholder letter.  A Netflix spokesman declined to comment.  Even debt investors with long positions in the bonds agree the short-sellers have a case.  \u201cThere is money to be made in the short-term\u201d by betting against Netflix debt, said John McClain, portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital, who is long the debt.  Those bets appear to be paying off.  The two most shorted of Netflix\u2019s bonds - $2.9 billion of paper maturing in 2026 and 2028 - hit record low prices last week, with the November 2026 bond dropping below 92 cents on the dollar. Their yields, which move in the opposite direction, have risen above their coupon rate.  Bonds can be shorted, or bet against, in much the same way as stocks. The short-seller borrows the securities from a bondholder and then sells them, hoping they can be bought back later at a lower price and returned to the original owner, pocketing the difference as profit.  Still, short-selling bonds - as opposed to betting against them in derivative markets such as credit default swaps - is far less common than shorting stocks, largely because bonds are far less liquid than stocks. They can also be pricey to trade because the short seller must pay interest to the securities\u2019 lender and pay any scheduled interest and principal payments owed to the bondholder.  Short positions in the U.S. high-yield market total about $28.5 billion, according to IHS Markit, a fraction of the $980 billion of shorted equities.  A FANG IN BONDLAND  Netflix, one of the so-called FANG stocks alongside Facebook Inc, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet Inc, has a relatively new but hefty presence in the high-yield bond market.  \u201cNetflix is the highest quality business that\u2019s ever been in high yield,\u201d said McClain, adding he did not believe the short positions have anything to do with credit fundamentals.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service earlier this year upgraded its rating one notch to \u201cBa3,\u201d three notches into junk territory. It is rated \u201cB+\u201d by Standard & Poor\u2019s, four notches into junk.  Netflix, which went public in 2002, had a modest debt load in its early years, but it has issued a net $7.5 billion of bonds in less than three years. Its long-term debt as a percentage of total capital has roughly doubled to 65 percent since the end of 2014.  More is likely to come. Netflix will have $14 billion in debt by 2020, Jason Kim, senior analyst at Goldman Sachs, estimated, making it one of the largest issuers in the high-yield market.  \u201cWe expect the next capital raise to come in the fourth quarter of 2018,\u201d Kim said.  Netflix is likely to be pressed on its issuance plans by Wall Street analysts on Tuesday when it reports third-quarter earnings.  Investors are also betting that Netflix bonds will fall because they are expensive compared with similarly rated companies. The yields on its two most shorted bonds are as much as 70 basis points below the average yield in the Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch BB-B High Yield Index.  \u201cNetflix bonds are trading well above their credit rating,\u201d said Neil Begley, senior analyst at Moody\u2019s. Their implied credit rating, based on Moody\u2019s analysis of the trading data, went up to investment grade in 2016. On average, the bonds have traded three or four notches above their credit rating for the past two years.","202":"April 16 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc added more international subscribers than expected in the first quarter as a slate of original shows including \u201cAltered Carbon\u201d kept viewers hooked to the video streaming service provider.

Speaking at a media conference in New Delhi, Hastings also said the company\u2019s first animated series from India, \u201cMighty Little Bheem\u201d, had been watched by 27 million households worldwide, in a sign of the country\u2019s importance to Netflix\u2019s plans for global expansion.  The producer of original series such as \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cSex Education\u201d, Netflix has nearly 160 million paying users worldwide, but has not disclosed subscriber figures for India.  The trial 3-month plans will be offered at a 20% discount to original prices, while users will get a 30% discount for six-month plans, the source said.  The Economic Times daily reported earlier on Wednesday that Netflix was testing longer subscription plans in India.

Nickelodeon will produce the films \u201cThe Loud House\u201d and \u201cRise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,\u201d which are based on its hit television franchises. The company hopes those films on other platforms will send viewers back to Viacom-owned networks.  The announcement, made on a morning conference call with Wall Street analysts, underscored the significance of its multi-pronged strategy, as it delivered a quarter when ticket sales of \u201cTransformers\u201d reboot \u201cBumblebee\u201d helped it beat profit estimates but revenue fell slightly short of expectations on weaker ad sales at its cable networks.  As Netflix and other existing and upcoming streaming service providers from Walt Disney Co and AT&T Inc\u2019s WarnerMedia will shake up the traditional U.S. cable industry, Viacom and sister company CBS Corp are redoubling efforts to become original content resources for other distributors.  Both companies, controlled by National Amusements, are expected to rekindle merger talks in the coming months.  The latest production deal follows an earlier multi-picture deal with Netflix.  Viacom also played up its $340-million purchase of Pluto TV and said it had high hopes to build an international advertising-supported streaming TV service that will include programming from its archive. It will launch a Spanish-language version this year, Viacom chief executive Bob Bakish said.  The Viacom office is seen in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, April 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  \u201cIt will be the next step in the evolution of this company,\u201d Bakish told analysts.  MIXED RESULTS  Net income attributable to Viacom fell to $321 million, or 80 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Dec. 31 from $537 million, or $1.33 per share, a year earlier.  Revenue for the year-end quarter was $3.09 billion, below estimates of $3.12 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  That reflected lower advertising revenue and a hit from currency swings at a time when the company is fighting for its place in a hugely competitive and changing U.S. media landscape.  Domestic affiliate revenue, or the fees collected from U.S. cable and satellite operators and online distributors, rose 5 percent to $969 million. Analysts expected a 2.4 percent rise, according to research firm FactSet.  The company, which owns MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, said total affiliate revenue rose 3 percent to $1.17 billion, beating estimates of $1.11 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue from filmed entertainment division, which includes Paramount Pictures, rose 14 percent to $621 million.  Since taking charge in 2016, Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish has focused on Paramount and the company\u2019s cable TV business.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.12 per share, above the average estimate of $1.03 per share.  Viacom said it expected full year revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis. It also expects advertising growth in 2019.","213":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hollywood period drama \u201cMank\u201d led a list of Golden Globe nominations on Wednesday that were strong on diversity and dominated by Netflix in a reflection of the upheaval wrought by the coronavirus pandemic on the movie world.  From the movie version of rap-infused musical \u201cHamilton\u201d to LGBTQ musical \u201cThe Prom\u201d and director nods for three women, the nominations - which kick off the Hollywood awards season - recognized social justice issues and performers of color in a U.S. entertainment industry that critics have long complained is dominated by white men.  The contest for the best drama movie will also include modern Great Recession saga \u201cNomadland,\u201d 1960s Vietnam War protest drama \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7,\u201d #MeToo revenge fantasy \u201cPromising Young Woman,\u201d and family drama \u201cThe Father\u201d about aging.

For television, British royal family series \u201cThe Crown,\u201d whose season focused on the late Princess Diana, led the way with six nods, including for most of its main cast, followed by quirky small-town comedy \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek.\u201d  Netflix Inc beat all comers in both film, with 22 nominations, and television, with 20. The tally followed a year in which the pandemic led Hollywood studios to push back dozens of their film releases or put them on streaming services.  Amazon Studios got seven nominations in the movie field.  Three of the five directors nominated were women, including Regina King for \u201cOne Night in Miami,\u201d about a meeting of four Black icons in the 1960s; Britain\u2019s Emerald Fennell for \u201cPromising Young Woman\u201d and Chinese-born filmmaker Chloe Zhao for \u201cNomadland.\u201d  Variety calculated that a record 30% of the acting nominees in the film categories were nonwhite.  They included Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman, in his last film role, the jazz period piece \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom;\u201d British-Pakistani actor Riz Ahmed as a drummer going deaf in \u201cSound of Metal;\u201d Andra Day for her role in \u201cThe United States vs. Billie Holiday;\u201d and Dev Patel for his modern twist on Charles Dickens\u2019 \u201cThe Personal History of David Copperfield.\u201d  \u201cWithout question, things are changing,\u201d said actor Leslie Odom Jr., who performed in \u201cHamilton,\u201d \u201cMusic\u201d and \u201cOne Night in Miami\u201d where he played singer-songwriter Sam Cooke.  \u201cThe table is getting longer, the room is getting larger, and the lens is finding new people and new interesting stories to tell,\u201d Odom said in a phone interview.  Foreign language film nods went to \u201cMinari, about a South Korean family trying to make it in the United States; elder love story \u201cTwo of Us\u201d from France; \u201cThe Life Ahead\u201d starring Italian legend Sophia Loren; Danish drinking comedy \u201cAnother Round\u201d and \u201cLa Llorona,\u201d a ghostly drama from Guatemala and France.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  QUIRKY CHOICES  The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which selects the nominees and winners, is known for its sometimes quirky choices, and this year was no exception. Spike Lee\u2019s critically acclaimed Vietnam War drama \u201cDa 5 Bloods\u201d was shut out completely, the little-seen \u201cMusic\u201d got two nods and perennial acting favorite Meryl Streep was excluded while her \u201cThe Prom\u201d co-star James Corden was among the nominees.  The Golden Globes are to be handed out at a virtual ceremony on Feb. 28, hosted by actors Tina Fey in New York and Amy Poehler in Los Angeles.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  \u201cDespite a stressed pandemic year, there is a comfort of sorts in embracing traditions,\u201d said \u201cMank\u201d star Gary Oldman of the ceremony.  It was a good day for Baron Cohen, who won nominations both for his \u201cBorat\u201d sequel and for his supporting role as counterculture leader Abbie Hoffman in \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7.\u201d  \u201cThese two films are different, but they share a common theme: Sometimes we have to protest injustice with our own farce,\u201d Baron Cohen said in a statement.  Aaron Sorkin, who was nominated for directing and writing \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7,\u201d said the film had struck an even greater contemporary chord than he envisaged after a year of political unrest in the United States.  \u201cThis has been a film 15 years in the making,\u201d Sorkin said in a phone interview. \u201cI always wanted the film to be about today and not 1968.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  BENGALURU (Reuters) - Amazon.com on Wednesday launched a lower-priced mobile-only subscription plan for its video streaming service in India, undercutting a similar plan by Netflix Inc to woo price-sensitive subscribers.  The Amazon Prime Video plan, meant for single users and available in standard definition quality, will cost 89 rupees ($1.22) per month initially, the company said.  In India, where data packages are among the cheapest in the world, mobile-only plans are likely to gain more traction given the large number of smartphone users. Such plans also help over-the-top (OTT) players tap into larger audiences, specially those who like to consume content on the go.

The auto probe, ordered on Wednesday, added to worries of another potential trade conflict when tensions with China simmered.  Early Thursday, Trump canceled the June 12 meeting citing Pyongyang\u2019s \u201copen hostility,\u201d even after North Korea followed through on a pledge to blow up tunnels at its nuclear test site.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  The telecoms industry, from world No. 2 mobile operator Vodafone to Deutsche Telekom, has in recent days reported a spike in data traffic on networks as thousands of people switched to home working or watched endless videos.  Telecoms providers can take measures to prevent gridlock for as long as necessary but must not block, slow down or prioritize traffic, the EU executive said, citing the bloc\u2019s net neutrality rules.  The Commission, which issued the pre-emptive warning on Thursday, wants to ensure a level playing field for all, even as it worries that crucial services such as healthcare and online learning for thousands of children may be slowed by traffic congestion.  Some companies are already taking steps to address those concerns.  Netflix said it would reduce bit rates, which determine the quality and size of its audio and video files, across all its streams in Europe for 30 days after EU industry chief Thierry Breton spoke to its Chief Executive Reed Hastings.  \u201cWe estimate that this will reduce Netflix traffic on European networks by around 25%, while also ensuring a good quality service for our members,\u201d the company said in a statement.  Netflix had over 42 million subscribers in Europe, Africa and the Middle East at the end of the first quarter of 2019, according to a filing, with the bulk estimated to be in Europe.  The Commission said in a joint statement with the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) that while operators are authorized to apply exceptional traffic management measures, \u201cthis must be done without discriminating individual content providers\u201d.  Large tech companies and consumer groups are fervent supporters of net neutrality rules which prevent telecoms operators from blocking or throttling traffic, or offering paid fast lanes.  The telecoms industry however has long campaigned for looser rules so they too can rake in lucrative revenues. They are likely to put pressure on regulators as new streaming service Disney+ launches in Europe next week.","218":"LONDON\/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry and his American-born wife Meghan have signed an exclusive multiyear production deal with Netflix Inc NFLX.O, a major step in their plan to make a living for themselves outside the royal family.

The couple moved to Southern California with their infant son Archie this year after stepping back from royal duties in January and announcing plans to be more financially independent.

In June, the couple signed with the Harry Walker Agency in New York, which serves as an agent for lectures by clients such as former U.S. Presidents Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as Oprah Winfrey. Harry and Meghan are expected to speak together and individually on issues such as racial justice, gender equity, the environment, and mental health.

Thatcher enters the Netflix television series portraying the British royal family as it moves into the 1980s, when the polarizing Conservative Party leader was at the height of her power.  Anderson said she used no prosthetics, not even teeth, but relied on body language and vocal idiosyncrasies to capture Thatcher\u2019s appearance.  \u201cIt came down to holding my mouth in the right way,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThen she had very specific mannerisms in terms of how she cocks her head, and how she leans forward.  \u201cYou start putting those things together and at some point you end up in the realm of Margaret Thatcher,\u201d said Anderson.  Thatcher was Britain\u2019s first female prime minister and her 11-year-term in office was the longest of the 20th century. She died aged 87 in 2013.  The new season of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d released on Netflix on Sunday, covers the escalation of conflict in Northern Ireland and the Falklands War. It will also portray the unhappy marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, who will be played by Emma Corrin.

In an 8-K filed on Monday, the company provided details on its international business ahead of its January fourth-quarter earnings report, which will disclose revenue and membership by region for the first time.  Netflix provided a benchmark for investors, releasing historical streaming revenue, membership and average revenue per paying streaming membership by region for each quarter of 2017 and 2018; for the first three quarters of 2019; and for the twelve-month periods ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2018 and the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, 2019.  In the Asia-Pacific region - the company\u2019s smallest - revenue was up 153% from the end of the third quarter of 2017 to the end of the third quarter of 2019. Membership grew 148% in the period.  Growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa also accelerated. Membership in the region increased 132% from the end of the third quarter of 2017 to the end of the third quarter of 2019, and membership revenue increased 105% in the period.  In Latin America, where the company says it is in 33% of broadband homes, streaming revenue increased 71% from the end of the third quarter of 2017 to the end of the third quarter of 2019. Membership in the period grew 61%.  Netflix is focusing on its international business as the streaming landscape becomes more crowded, with Walt Disney Co\u2019s Disney+ and Apple\u2019s Apple TV+ entering the market and two other services - HBO Max, from AT&T-owned WarnerMedia, and Comcast-owned NBCUniversal\u2019s Peacock - set to launch next year.","228":"April 6 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc is attempting its largest acquisition, offering more than $300 million to acquire a company that owns billboards across Los Angeles, including West Hollywood\u2019s famed Sunset Strip, according to people familiar with the matter.  The move illustrates how one of the most successful streaming media companies values physical advertising assets as it steps up its marketing efforts. Billboards are holding their own compared to other forms of traditional advertising, such as ads in newspapers or TV that are easy to skip.  Netflix is just one of the bidders for the Los Angeles-based company, called Regency Outdoor Advertising, and there is no certainty that its offer will prevail, the sources said this week, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Netflix declined to comment. Regency Outdoor did not respond to a request for comment.  Regency Outdoor is owned by two brothers, Drake and Brian Kennedy. Some of its billboards are on the Sunset Strip, a portion of Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles known for its live music and night clubs. The area is filled with splashy billboards often promoting upcoming TV shows and movies.  Regency Outdoor also owns billboards at Los Angeles International Airport, on major freeways, near the UCLA campus, and close to the Los Angeles Angels baseball stadium, according to its website.  Netflix has already advertised several of its series on Regency billboards including \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown.\u201d  Netflix is increasing its spending on marketing for its original shows and movies to $2 billion this year as it competes for subscribers with technology companies such as Amazon.com Inc , Hulu and Facebook Inc and traditional media companies such as Walt Disney Co.  Netflix said in a letter to shareholders earlier this year that its marketing spending was growing \u201ca little faster\u201d than its revenue.  As a result of the bigger marketing expenditure, Netflix\u2019s expenses per subscriber will jump around 25 percent to $16 per subscriber, up from $13 per subscriber, according to a recent MoffettNathanson report. The company reported it had 117.6 million worldwide streaming subscribers at the end of 2017.  \u201cAs the marketplace for original content becomes more crowded, Netflix is turning up the volume to promote the increasing number of Netflix originals,\u201d Michael Nathanson, a MoffettNathanson analyst, wrote in the research note.

FILE PHOTO: Traffic moves on a road past hoardings of Netflix's new television series \"Sacred Games\" in Mumbai, India, July 11, 2018. REUTERS\/Francis Mascarenhas  In a few short months, the world leader in video streaming has launched a blockbuster Mumbai-based crime thriller, been sued over comments about a former Indian Prime Minister and seen the future of two of its hit shows threatened by the #MeToo movement in India.  Helped by a roster that includes top-grossing movie franchise \u201cBaahubali\u201d, it has won fans among a young, tech savvy middle class and Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings has said India could deliver the service\u2019s next 100 million subscribers.  Local industry players, however, say Netflix\u2019s strategy of pricing close to rates it charges in developed markets will see it struggle against domestic competitors like 21st Century Fox-backed Hotstar and one of the country\u2019s top satellite TV providers, Tata Sky - a joint venture between the Tata Group and Fox.  Amazon, with a trove of original Indian content like crime drama \u201cBreathe\u201d, also offers movies and shows free to members of its Prime service.  \u201cWith the existing model that we have, the prices that we\u2019re at, we\u2019ve got a long runway still ahead of us,\u201d Netflix chief product officer, Greg Peters, said in a video interview after Tuesday\u2019s third-quarter results.  \u201cNow we\u2019ll experiment with other pricing models, not only for India, but around the world that will allow us to broaden access by providing a pricing tier that sits below our current lowest tier. We\u2019ll see how that does in terms of being able to accelerate our growth.\u201d  HARD-BOILED  The streaming giant launched in India two years ago. It has a library of local content comparable to rivals and scored a big hit in July with the release of \u201cSacred Games\u201d, a hard-boiled thriller built around Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Like other U.S. entertainment companies, it has identified the need to create local content as important in winning viewers in the big emerging markets likely to dominate growth over the next decade.  It has run into trouble, however, with the Bollywood studio that produced \u201cSacred Games\u201d disbanding earlier this month in a cloud of sexual harassment allegations against one of its partners, Vikas Bahl, and the show\u2019s lead writer Varun Grover.  Both men have denied the claims but Netflix said last week it was evaluating its options on the show - having earlier said it would be renewed.  At a time when India\u2019s average per capita income is one tenth of the United States\u2019, the service\u2019s monthly fees are almost identical - 500 rupees ($6.80) for a basic plan, 650 ($8.85) for a standard plan and 800 rupees ($11) for premium.  Hotstar in comparison offers its premium streaming service, including \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and English Premier League soccer, at 999 rupees for the whole year.  None of the companies mentioned in this report provide detailed paying subscriber numbers for the Indian market, but media executives say Netflix\u2019s figures are probably still less than a million.  \u201cThe current price point is prohibitively expensive for India,\u201d said one senior Indian media executive, asking not to be named because of potential business dealings with Netflix.  \u201cAs long as they remain at that price point they will remain within this 2-3 million, 4 million kind of zone. If they indeed aspire to get to 50 and 100 million, that is not going to happen at 600, 700 rupees (a month).\u201d  One analyst asked Hastings on Tuesday how much Netflix will have to tweak the model to achieve success.  \u201cWe\u2019ll go from expanding from English to Hindi to many more languages to more pricing options, more bundling, all of those things are possible,\u201d he said.  \u201cThere are over 300 million ... households and almost twice that in mobile phone subs. We\u2019ll take it a million at a time and figure out how to expand the market as we grow.\u201d","230":"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Netflix Inc is showing more African-made content and working with telecoms operators to make it easier for potential subscribers to make payments, a senior executive told Reuters ahead of its third-quarter results on Tuesday.  The online content streaming giant, which has 193 million subscribers globally, is keen to expand in Africa and is seeking ways to overcome challenges including slow and expensive internet and the lack of proper payments infrastructure in the 55-nation continent.  \u201cGiven the low credit card penetration across the continent ... we have partnered with local telcos ... for their customers to be able to add Netflix subscriptions to their bills,\u201d said Netflix\u2019s head of original programming for Africa, Dorothy Ghettuba.  She said they already have partnerships with Vodacom and Telkom South Africa, adding that Netflix is looking for further tie-ups.  Expensive high-speed internet in some countries is also a key challenge, Ghettuba said, adding that Netflix is trying to address that by allowing wi-fi downloads for later viewing rather than use pricey mobile data for streaming.  Netflix, well established in South Africa and Nigeria, is now looking towards the Kenyan market, Ghettuba said.  The pay TV market in Africa is dominated by South Africa\u2019s Multichoice Group, which has an edge over Netflix from its dozens of channels dedicated to news and live sports events.  The South African group, in addition to its entertainment channels showing films, series and documentaries, has also started online streaming service Showmax to compete directly with Netflix.  To improve its appeal in the market, Netflix has been boosting its library with African productions. [nL8N2H637P]  \u201cThe business is excited about Africa and is putting every effort behind it,\u201d said Ghettuba, who joined Netflix last year after a decade running a Kenyan production house.

Foreign stream firms, which have combined revenues of nearly one trillion dong ($43.15 million) from one million subscribers, according to the information and communications ministry\u2019s calculations, have never paid tax in Vietnam.  \u201cDomestic companies have to abide by tax and content regulations while foreign firms do not, which is unfair competition,\u201d the minister, Nguyen Manh Hung, told a government meeting.  \u201cSome content on Netflix has flouted regulations related to the history and sovereignty of the country, violence, drug use, and sex,\u201d he added.  Vietnam introduced a cyber security law two years ago that requires all foreign businesses earning income from online activities in Vietnam to store their data in the country.  But Netflix has yet to share any plans to place its servers locally or open an office in Vietnam.  The firm said in a statement last month that it was working with Vietnamese authorities to set up a mechanism for tax collection.  Netflix had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters and said it would provide a response later.  Hung said the information ministry, finance ministry and tax department were working together to facilitate tax collection by calculating foreign streaming firms\u2019 revenues in Vietnam since their entries into the market.  Tech giants are increasingly facing tougher fiscal regimes in Southeast Asia, where regulators held talks last year on a regional push to tax tech giants more.

It is not the first time that Diana\u2019s life has been dramatized since her death at age 36 in a Paris car crash in 1997.

Emma Corrin, 24, the newcomer who plays the young Diana, was not even two years old when the princess died, acknowledged that it was daunting to take on such a beloved figure.  Nick Bullen, editor-in-chief of True Royalty TV, said that for many young people Diana \u201cis a character from history.\u201d  But he added, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to watch my parents\u2019 marriage play out on television.\u201d  As much as she enjoys \u201cThe Crown,\u201d Junor has reservations about the show\u2019s seamless blend of factual events and imagination.  \u201cI think it\u2019s brilliant drama, but it is drama, and my greatest fear has always been that people would come to view it as fact (and that) in the future it will be seen as a historical record of these years, and it\u2019s not,\u201d she said.  Bullen said shows like \u201cThe Crown\u201d lead to increased interest and research in the British royal family.  \u201cI think that will be even more the case in this season because the (Diana) story is so readily available,\u201d he said.

Real estate stocks, utilities and consumer staples - commonly considered defensives - led declines following a rebound sparked by bargain hunters looking for stocks likely to weather an economic slump.  Another set of gains for Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc , Apple, Netflix Inc and Google-parent Alphabet Inc, known as the FAANG group of stocks, helped the Nasdaq jump 1% on Tuesday.  \u201cStocks have been on a wild ride ... (and) not surprisingly, investors are split on whether to lean in to or fade the current rally,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse Securities in New York.  An unprecedented round of fiscal and monetary stimulus had helped equity markets stabilize last week following wild swings that sent the benchmark S&P 500 up 9% one day only to slump 12% in the next session.  Wall Street\u2019s volatility index has retreated from 12-year highs, but is still at levels rarely seen since the global financial crisis as the outbreak deepens in the United States and disrupts supply chains.  Sliding from the record highs of mid February, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes are now set to end the quarter more than 18% lower from the start of the year.  The declines have erased more than $5 trillion from the value of S&P 500 firms in the first quarter, and investors fear corporate defaults and more mass layoffs going in to the second quarter.  The blue-chip Dow is on course for its biggest quarterly percentage decline since 1987 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq is set to close out its worst first three months of the year since 2008.  \u201cWhile the majority of people want to remain optimistic that we\u2019ve seen the lows ... that optimism is merely based on a lot of hope,\u201d said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.  At 10:17 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 39.30 points, or 0.18%, at 22,366.78, the S&P 500 was up 0.54 points, or 0.02%, at 2,627.19. The Nasdaq Composite was up 51.60 points, or 0.66%, at 7,825.75.  Shares of Carnival Corp, already by hammered by plunging global travel demand, tumbled 12% after it said it was raising about $6 billion in combination debt and equity and suspend its dividend payouts.  The energy index jumped 4%, boosted by a rebound in prices from 18-year lows after the United States and Russia agreed to discuss stabilizing energy markets.  Advancing issues almost matched decliners on the NYSE and on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded one new 52-week high and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded seven new highs and 13 new lows.

Starring Viola Davis as Black blues singer Ma Rainey and the late Chadwick Boseman as a hot-headed trumpet player, the movie comes to Netflix on Friday as Hollywood and the United States grapple with systemic racism.  \u201cThe reason why (the film) resonates today is because racism hasn\u2019t been destroyed. It has just evolved,\u201d said Davis.  \u201cYou can\u2019t go through 400 years of systemic racism and policies and practices and not have it resonate today in education, in how women are paid and how Black people are paid, and how worthy we\u2019re seen,\u201d she added.  \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d takes place on a hot Chicago day in 1927 during a tense recording session where the diva-like singer engages in a battle of wills with her white manager and her band over money and control of her music.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Davis, who won a supporting actress Oscar in 2017 and is widely expected to be nominated next year, said she saw Ma as a liberated woman \u201cmeaning she was not a woman of her time because she was a woman who unapologetically knew her worth.\u201d  Adapted from August Wilson\u2019s play of the same name, \u201cMa Rainey\u201d was filmed in July 2019, a year before street protests broke out nationwide over the killings of Black people by police.  \u201cTo me, (the movie) is a conversation about how can we have a future until we come to terms with, and heal, and address the sins and scars of the past? That to me is the American conversation,\u201d said director George C. Wolfe.  Davis said the same conversation also applied to the entertainment industry, which is under pressure to increase diversity behind and in front of the camera.  \u201cA lot of our artistry, a lot of our imagination, a lot of our ideas are not seen as good as our white counterparts.

FILE PHOTO: Gamers and visitors take a rest at the booth of Netflix during Europe's leading digital games fair Gamescom, which showcases the latest trends of the computer gaming scene in Cologne, Germany, August 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Wolfgang Rattay\/File Photo  Turkey last month granted its radio and television watchdog sweeping oversight over all online content, including streaming platforms and news outlets, a move that raised concerns that the state was tightening its control over the media.  Ebubekir Sahin, president of Turkey\u2019s television watchdog RTUK, announced Netflix\u2019s application on Tuesday, and said on Twitter that over 600 institutions, including local streaming platforms Puhu TV and Blu TV, had also applied for licenses.  As part of obtaining the license, the Los Gatos, California-based subscription streaming service will set up a local entity and pay 0.5% of revenue generated in Turkey to the government. The company said it is in discussions to pay similar levies in Spain and Italy.  Netflix serves 1.5 million subscribers in Turkey and only reaches about 10% of the country\u2019s broadband households, the company said, making the Turkish market a potentially important and lucrative source of new subscribers as competition mounts.  The company operates one of the world\u2019s largest streaming services and has sustained its position at the top by courting new subscribers outside the United States as its U.S. home market matures.  To date, Turkey has not attempted to censor Netflix content, a source familiar with the matter said.  Turkey\u2019s new regulation stipulates that content providers should get a fresh license to continue operating in Turkey, and comply with RTUK guidelines.  If they don\u2019t respect the guidelines, they will be given 30 days to change their content, or face having their licenses suspended for three months and later canceled. The announcement last month did not specify what standards RTUK would expect.  Critics have said the move will allow the government to tighten its grip on Turkish media, which is largely owned or controlled by supporters of President Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party.  GROWTH MARKET  Netflix and the Saudi Arabian government were widely condemned when the company pulled an episode of the comedy show, \u201cPatriot Act with Hasan Minhaj\u201d from its Saudi Arabia service in January, after officials complained. The show was critical of Saudi Arabia after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  Unlike other popular internet-based content providers and services, including Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O YouTube and Twitter Inc TWTR.N, which were banned at one time in Turkey, Netflix is generally not a platform for news or current affairs.  Netflix is hoping a proactive approach to working with local regulators, such as by bolstering parental controls, would help it address potential censorship issues down the line, the source said.  \u201cOur goal is to protect children from content that may be inappropriate for their age, while ensuring our members can continue to watch the shows and films of their choice,\u201d a Netflix spokesman said on Monday.  Netflix declined to comment about potential censorship concerns beyond its statement.  In the quarter ended June 30, it lost subscribers in the United States for the first time in eight years and fell short of targets for new subscriber growth overseas. Netflix executives said it would still meet its annual target.  In Turkey, it has invested in local programing and some of its TV series have attracted international audiences, including \u201cThe Protector,\u201d about an Istanbul shopkeeper who battles immortal enemies.  Netflix has ordered two seasons of \u201cThe Gift\u201d - another Turkish supernatural drama - and has commissioned the Turkish series, \u201cLove 101.\u201d  Shares of Netflix were down 1% to $290.86 on Nasdaq.","247":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada on Tuesday unveiled plans to make U.S. tech companies such as Netflix Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc pay for domestically produced content but will not make them collect local taxes, officials said.

The finance ministry said Monday it is in talks to levy the charge on foreign online businesses, and the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sent a bill to Congress to legislate for the tax.  \u201cIf we approve the initiative, the Mexican state could obtain around 3.6 billion pesos a year,\u201d Ricardo Monreal, Senate leader of MORENA, told a news conference.  \u201cI\u2019m not talking about Uber, I\u2019m not talking about Airbnb,\u201d Monreal added. \u201cI\u2019m only talking about the audiovisuals.

AT&T-owned HBO, however, will bring its formidable \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which scored 22 of the premium cable network\u2019s 108 nods.  The two will compete for the television industry\u2019s highest honors with basic cable network FX, broadcast channel NBC and online services Hulu and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Prime Video, just part of the crowd fighting to shine a light on their shows in a large sea of programming.  \u201cIt means a lot to all of these players, all of whom are in hyper-competition right now to attract our attention,\u201d said Peter Csathy, founder and chairman of consulting and business development firm Creatv Media.  HBO and Netflix have fought for viewers since 2013 when the streaming service launched \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d a political thriller that established it as a home for top-quality TV programming. HBO had long dominated that space with acclaimed series such as \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cSex and the City.\u201d  Netflix has since expanded into a wide range of genres, which helped boost its nominations count with shows such as reality series \u201cQueer Eye.\u201d  HBO has argued that its focus on a smaller, curated slate of programming ensures quality.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Randall Stephenson, chairman and chief executive of HBO owner AT&T Inc, on Wednesday called Netflix the WalMart of video subscription services, while he likened HBO to luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very premium, high-end brand for premium content,\u201d Stephenson said at an investor conference.  So far, the race is neck and neck after dozens of this year\u2019s Emmys were handed out at events in Los Angeles earlier this month. HBO won 17 trophies, including best documentary for \u201cThe Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling.\u201d Netflix collected 16.  The major awards will be unveiled in a nationally televised show on Monday.  According to awards experts, HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is the biggest competition to Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d for the prestigious best drama award. Netflix\u2019s entries in the category are \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown.\u201d  Another streaming service, Amazon Prime, has a shot at the best comedy trophy with \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d as does basic cable channel FX with \u201cAtlanta.\u201d  IndieWire executive editor Michael Schneider predicts Emmy voters will spread the awards among several streaming services and traditional networks, but that HBO will continue to reign as the most-honored outlet overall.  \u201cHBO has more front runners,\u201d he said.","251":"The Netflix logo is seen on their office in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc, the world\u2019s dominant streaming service, will not make its TV shows and movies available through Apple Inc\u2019s upcoming video offering, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on Monday.  \u201cWe prefer to let our customers watch our content on our service,\u201d Hastings told reporters at the company\u2019s offices in Hollywood. \u201cWe have chosen not to integrate with their service.\u201d  Apple is expected to unveil a television and video service at an event on March 25, a move that will amp up competition for Netflix and others that deliver entertainment programing online.  Sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that the service may resell subscriptions from CBS Corp, Viacom Inc and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp\u2019s Starz among others, as well as Apple\u2019s own original content.  Walt Disney Co and AT&T Inc\u2019s WarnerMedia also plan to offer subscription streaming services.  Asked about the looming competition, Hastings said the biggest challenge for Netflix is to \u201cnot get too distracted\u201d by rivals but still \u201clearn lessons\u201d from them.  \u201cThese are amazing, large, well-funded companies with very significant efforts,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cThey are going to do some great shows. I\u2019m going to be envious. They\u2019re going to come up with some great ideas. We\u2019re going to want to borrow those.\u201d  But, he added, \u201cwe will make this a better industry if we have great competitors.\u201d  Hastings also said he expected Netflix, like other U.S. technology companies, to be blocked in China \u201cfor a long time.\u201d","252":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - As Hollywood studios unleash their summer blockbusters into theaters, Netflix Inc is trying to give film buffs a reason to stay home.  The streaming service is on track to release at least 86 Netflix original films in 2018, the company told Reuters. That exceeds the scheduled output of the top four traditional studios combined, as well as Netflix\u2019s previous record of 61 films last year.  The aggressive strategy is aimed in part at addressing complaints that the service\u2019s movie library is stale, an issue likely to be exacerbated by Walt Disney Co\u2019s decision to stop supplying Netflix with new films for its U.S. customers in 2019. Buying movies from other studios also has become more expensive as streaming competition has intensified.  Having more of its own films is paying off, Netflix said. The company told Reuters that the 33 Netflix films released so far this year have been watched more than 300 million times by more than 80 million account holders worldwide. That\u2019s an average audience of more than 9 million viewers per film.  Executives said the large number of movies is a response to the wide range of tastes they are trying to satisfy, and that data they collect on subscriber viewing habits provides insight that helps them choose movies.  Fifty-five percent of Netflix\u2019s 125 million customers live outside the United States, and the company is counting on foreign markets to drive future growth.  \u201cIt\u2019s art and science,\u201d said Ian Bricke, who oversees Netflix\u2019s independent film licensing and production. \u201cOur global audience is more and more diverse. We are constantly learning and trying to get smarter.\u201d  SPENDING SPREE  The company would not say how much it is spending on its film push, but it has budgeted $8 billion for programming in 2018, a figure that includes original TV series and films as well as content licensed from others.  A scene from the Netflix original \u201cMudbound,\u201d which earned four Oscar nominations. Netflix\/via REUTERS  The heavy spending will lead to negative free cash flow of up to $4 billion this year, the company has said. Investors have so far endorsed the strategy as Netflix subscriber rolls keep booming, sending shares soaring 70 percent this year to $326.13.  The Netflix film slate features everything from low-budget family fare to higher-brow independent dramas such as last year\u2019s \u201cMudbound,\u201d which earned four Oscar nominations, and an expensive mobster tale due out next year starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.  About one-third of Netflix viewership is for movies, company executives have said, while the rest is for television offerings, including the company\u2019s highly acclaimed original series such as \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cStranger Things.\u201d  The critical reception for Netflix original films has been mixed, and some prominent directors balk at the idea of making movies that will be seen mainly on the small screen.  \u201cMy entire life has been spent trying to give audiences something in a large, large forum,\u201d Steven Spielberg told Reuters. \u201cI love the whole feeling of social interaction outside. You leave your house, you park your car, you go somewhere. Those are the kinds of audiences I like to talk to.\u201d  Unlike traditional studios, which have increasingly focused resources on expensive action spectacles and sequels, Netflix is producing and acquiring movies across genres, from teen dramas and romantic comedies to horror flicks and sci-fi adventures.  At least 17 of this year\u2019s Netflix films will be in languages other than English, including French, Arabic, Hungarian, Japanese and Russian. Eight or more will be in Spanish.  The company has promised more big-budget films like 2017\u2019s Will Smith action flick \u201cBright,\u201d with former Universal Pictures executive Scott Stuber leading that effort.  THE BIG-SCREEN OPTION  Some Netflix films also go to a limited number of theaters. In 2017, Netflix released 33 movies in theaters in 40 cities around the world, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos told Reuters, and some played for as long as seven weeks. \u201cBright\u201d opened in 12 locations while action adventure film \u201cOkja,\u201d from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho, was shown in about 50.  Theater screenings help allay concerns of some filmmakers and actors. But the company insists its movies be available to streaming subscribers the same day they debut in theaters, prompting most large theater chains to reject Netflix films.  Some in Hollywood worry their films will get lost in the sheer volume of new Netflix movies.  \u201cI don\u2019t yet have clarity on how they are going to make a splash with 80-plus films,\u201d said one agent who asked to remain anonymous because of ongoing business with Netflix. \u201cIt has led me, in setting up films at Netflix, to question whether that\u2019s the right move.\u201d  Netflix argues that its trove of viewership data allows it to market films directly to customers most likely to appreciate them, and to pull together a large audience from around the world.  Some big stars and directors have embraced the Netflix model. The company\u2019s most ambitious movie gamble to date is \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d the coming De Niro and Pacino film directed by Martin Scorsese. The movie cost at least $125 million to make, a price tag that others rejected.  De Niro said he was thrilled that Netflix opened its checkbook for the movie, which includes costly special effects to make the actors appear as younger versions of themselves in parts of the film.  \u201cThey could afford it and do it properly,\u201d De Niro told Reuters. \u201cThe main thing is to make the movie the way it should be made.\u201d  To view a graphic on Netflix far outpaces its rivals in new film releases, click: tmsnrt.rs\/2IkWI5f","253":"LOS ANGELES, Sept 20 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc\u2019s HBO network dominated Sunday\u2019s Emmy Awards with 30 wins, including best drama \u201cSuccession\u201d and limited series \u201cWatchmen,\u201d while Apple Inc took home its first award for the iPhone maker\u2019s dive into streaming television.  Online video pioneer Netflix Inc, which headed into the ceremony with a record 160 nominations, earned 21 honors. The Pop cable network, owned by ViacomCBS Inc, took the top comedy prize for offbeat series \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d which swept comedy categories to collect nine awards overall.  Winning the highest honors in television bestows a mark of prestige that networks can tout in their marketing to attract audiences in a crowded entertainment landscape. AT&T, Walt Disney Co, Apple and others have launched streaming video services to compete with Netflix.

The exception was in 2018, when Netflix and HBO tied in Emmy wins.  This year, HBO\u2019s alternative-reality drama \u201cWatchmen\u201d was the most honored program overall with 11 awards, while the network\u2019s media dynasty drama \u201cSuccession\u201d scored seven honors.

The Pop network landed the best comedy award for the sixth and final season of \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d a series about a once-wealthy family forced to live in a rundown motel in an out-of-the-way town. The show was filmed in Toronto and aired on the CBC network in Canada.  \u201cThanks to CBC and Pop for broadcasting this without hesitation,\u201d creator and star Daniel Levy said as he accepted his award.  The wins for \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d also were a victory for Netflix. The series has streamed on Netflix since 2017, helping to boost the audience.

Netflix has surged 35 percent since its previous quarterly report on Jan. 22, making it one of Wall Street\u2019s best performers as the S&P 500 has slipped into correction territory and investors worry a nine-year bull market may be ending.  Netflix\u2019s March-quarter report after the bell on Monday will be the first from the so-called FANG stocks, which also includes Facebook Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc, that have powered the market higher in recent years.  Investors will track how Netflix shares react in extended trade for clues about the market\u2019s willingness to push valuations higher.  Netflix\u2019s popularity with investors has put its stock price at 100 times expected earnings, down from a multiple of 117 times earnings in January but far higher than the S&P 500\u2019s earnings multiple of 16, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Investors on the Robinhood stock trading app, which is popular with young people, were buying Netflix shares 7 percent more than they were selling them ahead of Netflix\u2019s report. That compares to a buy\/sell ratio of 20 percent ahead of Netflix\u2019s previous report, Robinhood said in an email.  Global Google searches for Netflix in the first quarter rose 32 percent year over year, slightly more than the 26 percent increase in the prior quarter, suggesting solid growth but no big upside surprise, wrote B.

REUTERS\/File Photos  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A wave of quarterly reports from Netflix NFLX.O and other top-tier, high-growth companies starting on Wednesday will test Wall Street's willingness to extend a recent rally driven by expectations of lower interest rates.  Facebook FB.O, Amazon AMZN.O and Google-owner Alphabet GOOGL.O, all part of the so-called FANG group of widely held stocks, have jumped over 5% so far in July, with investors increasingly willing to bet on the volatile names thanks to expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates later this month by as much as half a percentage point to support economic growth.  The FANG companies, combined with investor favorites Apple AAPL.O and Microsoft MSFT.O, account for about 17% of the S&P 500's $26 trillion market capitalization, making reaction to their quarterly results key to Wall Street sentiment.  Netflix has been the FANG group's poorest performer this month, up just 0.2% as investors worry that looming competition from Walt Disney Co DIS.N in video streaming could limit its already cooling subscriber growth.  Still, the leading video entertainment company is up 2% since its weaker-than-expected quarterly report in April, and up 37% year to date.  The reports by Netflix, scheduled for after the bell on Wednesday, followed by Microsoft MSFT.O on Thursday, and Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet next week could fuel gains on Wall Street, or put an end to the market's recent strength.  \u201cThe FANG stocks have done well because of overall market sentiment. But we\u2019ve come a long way in a hurry, and a little bit like a baby, you\u2019ve got to worry if there has to be a little burp,\u201d said John Brady, managing director at R.J. O\u2019Brien & Associates in Chicago.  Netflix in April forecast weaker-than-expected growth in new subscriptions, and concerns since then have only increased following announcements that Netflix will lose its two most-watched shows in the United States - \"Friends\" and \"The Office\" - to upcoming rival services from AT&T Inc T.N and NBC Universal in 2020 and 2021, respectively.  Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, said his Diversified Equity Fund ADX.N is overweight Netflix due in part to its strong original content. The fund is underweight Facebook on expectations that the company has not fully recognized the regulatory challenges it faces, including in relation to its plan to launch a cryptocurrency, which has faced a backlash from governments and central bankers since it was unveiled last month.  \u201cWho at Facebook thought it would be a good idea to bring up this Libra cryptocurrency right now? The nicest way to say it is that it was ill-advised, given everything that\u2019s on their plate,\u201d Stoeckle said.  Netflix predicted in April it would pick up a softer-than-expected 5 million new streaming subscribers in the June quarter. Analysts expect Netflix\u2019s second-quarter revenue to rise 26% to $4.93 billion, while its net income is seen falling 34% to $255 million, according to Refinitiv. Earnings per share are is expected at 56 cents.  \u201cNetflix is going to be interesting when it comes to guidance,\u201d said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research in Chicago. \u201cThey are going to have lot of competition, and I think they\u2019re going to have to give us some guidance on whether they believe they can fight it off.\u201d  Since 2002, Netflix\u2019s second-quarter reports on average have been followed by a 5.9% decline in its stock the following day, according to Bespoke Investment Group. That compares to an average increase of 0.6% in the following trading day across all quarters for Netflix.  Facebook is to post its results on July 24, followed by Amazon and Alphabet on July 25. Facebook and Alphabet face challenges including calls for increased regulation, while investors worry that Amazon's race to expand one-day shipping will cut into its profits just as competitors including Walmart WMT.N and Target TGT.N improve their own online sales and deliveries.  Year-to-date, Amazon has surged 35% and is less than 2% below its record high set last September.  Facebook has rallied 56% in 2019 and is 6% short of the record high it set a year ago, just before it warned of a multi-year squeeze on its business margins, sending its stock into months of decline as investors worried about fallout from the company\u2019s mishandling of users\u2019 personal information.  Even after their rallies this year, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are trading at forward price\/earnings multiples below their two-year averages.  Analysts expect Amazon\u2019s quarterly revenue to grow by 18% to $62.4 billion, with non-GAAP net income growing 10% to $2.78 billion.  Facebook\u2019s June-quarter revenue is seen jumping 25% to $16.3 billion, with net income up 6% to $5.4 billion.

This leaves Multichoice free to fend for itself in an increasingly competitive market where Netflix is already supplying thousands of viewers with original TV content and Hollywood hits such as \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d.  \u201cThe intention is to basically have absolutely minimal debt going to Multichoice to provide them with flexibility to make any strategic move they want to make,\u201d said Naspers\u2019 chief executive Bob van Dijk. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to suck any cash out of Multichoice.\u201d  Although streaming is still rare on a continent hobbled by slow internet speeds, reaching fewer than 2 million of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s billion citizens, it is increasingly challenging more popular satellite-TV services.  Multichoice\u2019s fledgling internet-streaming service, Showmax, is betting a blend of Hollywood blockbusters and local content such as \u201cReal Househelps of Kawangware\u201d and \u201cThe Bachelor South Africa\u201d will set it apart from rivals. It launched Showmax in 2016.  Naspers does not provide subscriber numbers for Showmax, but London-based Digital TV Research estimates it had 334,000 at the end of last year, fewer than half as many as Netflix and mostly in South Africa.  SHOWMAX  Multichoice had 7.5 billion rand ($503 million) cash at the end of the latest financial disclosure period in March, generated largely from subscription fees of as much as 809 rand a month from some of its 13.5 million households across the continent.  \u201cThe listing of Multichoice Group will create a leading entertainment business on the JSE that is profitable and cash generative,\u201d Patel said in e-mail reply to questions.  The company did not provide details on how it would deploy the money but said its balance sheet would allow it to pursue growth opportunities in African video entertainment and pay a \u201cmeaningful dividend\u201d to shareholders. Analysts also expect it to scale up Showmax.  \u201cI expect them to be quite a good dividend paying stock but on the other hand it is an industry that is facing structural change so I expect them to continue to invest in Showmax to defend the position,\u201d said Renier de Bruyn, a portfolio manager at Sanlam Private Wealth.  Multichoice\u2019s dominant position in most of its markets makes it unlikely to seek to acquire rivals.  Founded in 1915, Naspers has transformed itself from an apartheid-era newspaper publisher into a $100 billion behemoth thanks largely to cash flow from Multichoice that enabled it to pursue private-equity style investments in e-commerce platforms across the world.  According to Digital TV Research the number of pay TV users in sub-Saharan Africa - a region of more than a billion people - is expected to jump by three quarters between 2017 and 2023 to nearly 41 million, with more than half of that signing up for satellite TV offerings.  Over the same period, subscriptions for streaming services - which also include Kwese, Cell C\u2019s Black and Vodacom\u2019s VideoPlay - are forecast to grow more than six-fold to nearly 10 million.  CUTTING EDGE  \u201cWe\u2019re quite confident. The combination of Multichoice\u2019s reach, Showmax and DSTV Now cutting edge internet television services will provide unique and unmatched offering,\u201d said Multichoice Chief Executive Imtiaz Patel.  DSTV Now is an app that allows Multichoice subscribers to live stream channels on the satellite platform.  The company has invested heavily in infrastructure that allows it to beam television content since its launch more than 20 years ago.  Video offering via satellite is expected to remain at the heart of video entertainment for the majority of Africans for at least the next five years despite a rapid uptake of video on demand offerings from internet streaming services.  The bulk of internet users rely on mobile phones to connect but hardly use their data to stream videos because of the cost. In South Africa, for example, a 1GB data bundle costs around 149 rand, a stiff price in a country where the minimum wage is 20 rand an hour.  The listing of Multichoice is likely to fetch between 9 and 12 times its $627 million annual core earnings, or EBITDA, valuing it at least $5.6 billion, bankers and analysts said and making it a blue-chip Top-40 stock on the Johannesburg bourse similar in size to drugmaker Aspen Pharmacare.  \u201cWe endorse this decision. Naspers recently raised 140 billion rand, twice the size of Multichoice, by selling 2 percent of Tencent and 33 billion rand from the sale of their Flipkart stake,\u201d said Byron Lotter, a portfolio manager at Vestact, which owns shares in Naspers.  \u201cHistorically Naspers used the Multichoice cash cow to fund new acquisitions. They no longer need the cash from Multichoice.\u201d  ($1 = 14.9056 rand)  (1 South African rand = $0.0670)","262":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in an Eikon news window.)  * Netflix jumps after raising U.S. subscription rates  * Weak results from JPM, Wells Fargo weigh on bank stocks  * Investors monitoring vote on PM May\u2019s Brexit deal  * UnitedHealth contributes most to Dow\u2019s rise  * Indexes gain: Dow 0.56 pct, S&P 0.94 pct, Nasdaq 1.56 pct (Changes comment, adds details, updates prices)  Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday as Netflix spurred a rally in technology and internet stocks and UnitedHealth posted strong results, while hopes of more stimulus for China\u2019s slowing economy encouraged buying in risky assets.

The result underscored the rise of Netflix in Hollywood, which matched HBO\u2019s total just five years after starting a big push into original programing. Before Monday, HBO had won the most Emmys of any single network for 16 straight years.  This year, HBO\u2019s fantasy series \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d won the best drama honor for a third time and was the most-honored show with nine awards in total.  Best comedy went to \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d on Amazon Prime Video. It marked the first time a streaming service had won in the category. The show collected eight trophies overall.  The wins give networks and streaming services bragging rights to use in marketing to try to make their shows stand out in a crowded TV landscape where hundreds of scripted shows, reality series and other programing fight for viewers.  For Amazon AMZN.O, Hollywood awards also draw people to online shopping, according to Jeff Bezos, chief executive of the online retailer. \"When we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes,\" Bezos said at an industry conference in 2016.  The Emmy battle between HBO and Netflix has raged since 2013 when Netflix launched \"House of Cards,\" a political thriller that established it as a home for top-quality TV programing. HBO, now owned by AT&T Inc T.N, had long dominated that space with acclaimed series such as \"The Sopranos\" and \"Sex and the City.\"  Netflix\u2019s trophies on Monday included five for historical drama \u201cThe Crown,\u201d including best drama actress Claire Foy, four for \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d and three for limited series \u201cGodless.\u201d  \u201cThank you to Netflix for your support of artists,\u201d Jeff Daniels, a supporting actor winner for \u201cGodless,\u201d said as he accepted his award.

A star performer in the quartet of the so-called FANG stocks that have fueled the market\u2019s gains in recent years, Netflix has surged 106.2 percent year-to-date, leading the S&P 500 and making it one of Wall Street\u2019s most closely-watched stocks.

The S&P 500 tech index, which led last year with a 37-percent rise, is up more than 15 percent so far this year.

Netflix shares jumped 6.3 percent after the video streaming company said it was raising prices for its U.S. subscribers. Other internet stocks, including shares of Alphabet Inc , Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc, also rose following the announcement.  The S&P 500 communication services index, which includes Netflix and Alphabet, climbed 1.5 percent. S&P 500 technology stocks advanced 1.4 percent.  Stocks also found support from hints by Chinese officials at more stimulus in the near term, easing concerns about a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had good news today overall,\u201d said J.J.

Earlier in the day, gains were capped by disappointing earnings reports from big U.S. banks.  JPMorgan Chase & Co, the largest U.S. bank by assets, missed quarterly profit estimates due to a slump in bond trading revenue, while Wells Fargo & Co said its loan book shrank and quarterly revenue fell in all of its major businesses.  JPMorgan shares erased the early losses and were last up 0.8 percent.  Health insurer UnitedHealth Group jumped 3.1 percent and was the top gainer on the Dow after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit.  Analysts expect S&P 500 profits to have grown 14 percent in the fourth quarter, much lower than the 20.1 percent growth forecast in October, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

While Wall Street remains overwhelmingly positive on Netflix and its role in video streaming globally, the second quarter figures did raise question marks over future growth and six brokerages cut their price targets on the company\u2019s shares.  \u201cThe quarter is a reminder that Netflix\u2019s cadence of net adds is not linear, but lumpy in nature,\u201d said Justin Patterson, an analyst with Raymond James and Associates in San Francisco, while pointing to the absence of a new hit series as a driver.  \u201cThe company had lots of new content during the quarter; what it did not have was a major new breakout series.\u201d  Riding on the success of its original shows such as \u201c13 Reasons Why,\u201d \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d Netflix had beaten subscriber growth expectations in seven out of last 10 quarters.

What is not clear is where the hurdles to that unbroken run of growth will come from, be it stronger competition from Amazon Prime or the changes in control of major film and TV franchises heralded by Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp\u2019s bid for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.

Olson and several others pointed to the World Cup as a possible distraction in the quarter that might have encouraged subscribers to hold off or freeze subscriptions for a month.  The 2018 soccer tournament that is among the most-watched TV events started on June 14 and has just finished.  \u201cNetflix is in a business that varies by quarter anyway and perhaps the company shouldn\u2019t have gotten too enamored with the crazy success of the last two quarters, which was invigorating but not sustainable,\u201d Forrester analyst James McQuivey said.","277":"FILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is seen on their office in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 16, 2018.

According to the ministry of culture, the surcharge, dubbed \u201cNetflix tax\u201d by Polish media, will be paid directly to the Polish Film Institute (PISF), a state cultural agency.

FILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is seen on their office in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Investors should watch for how Netflix responds to competition, its subscriber count and forecast, and any comments about global pricing, its shrinking library of licensed programming and its original-content strategy.  NEW COMPETITORS  Although the coming entry of Walt Disney Co DIS.N, AT&T Inc T.N and Apple Inc AAPL.O into the streaming wars could dampen Netflix's U.S. growth, experts do not see this as a zero-sum game.  Subscribers are likely to choose multiple online video options instead of picking just one. The Disney+ streaming service is expected to share 80% of Netflix\u2019s customers, said analysts at Raymond James and Associates.  \u201cNetflix forms the central piece of the digital bundle,\u201d the analysts said.  Netflix\u2019s wide range of content keeps the company safe from being replaced, said Cowen analyst John Blackledge, who called fears of new competitors \u201coverdone.\u201d  SUBSCRIBERS  The larger share of Netflix\u2019s growth is coming from markets outside the United States. The company forecasts that it added 5 million paid streaming customers from April through June, with 4.7 million coming from international markets.  Some analysts believe that as more well-funded streaming services enter the market, Netflix\u2019s subscriber growth rate will slow. The third-quarter forecast will be a key metric for shareholders.  INTERNATIONAL PRICING  Netflix raised prices in Britain, Switzerland, Greece and Western Europe during the second quarter.  With more cash from higher prices, Netflix could use the money to secure new deals for original content or licensing contracts. Analysts said language options and localized content will have a huge impact on growth in international markets.  SHRINKING LIBRARY  Hit shows \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d will leave Netflix in 2020 and 2021, respectively, putting more pressure on the company to entice fans with original programming such as \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cWhen They See Us.\u201d  Investors should watch for the amount Netflix plans to spend on original programming and whether the company plans to close fewer licensing deals.  ORIGINAL CONTENT  More original projects are coming to Netflix including partnerships with \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d creator Shonda Rhimes.  \u201c2020 will see the fruit of Netflix\u2019s production deals,\u201d said Justin Patterson, an analyst at Raymond James.

Goldman Sachs raised its price target by $50 to $480. The brokerage had earlier cut the price target to $430 from $470.  Netflix shares have gained about 81 percent this year and are worth six times what they were at the start of 2015, a reflection of the overwhelming faith investors have in the company\u2019s lead in video streaming.  Some have begun to question, however, whether Netflix\u2019s business model is as durable as the share price action suggests, given the huge investments the company has begun to make in its own content, and burgeoning competition.  Analysts from U.S. financial group Keybanc downgraded their rating on Netflix to \u201csector weight\u201d from \u201coverweight\u201d, questioning whether the company was capable of improving investment returns and margins in years to come.

Analysts pointed to \u201csolid trends\u201d in India, where the success of homegrown shows like Sacred Games and Ghoul have helped raise its profile and hopes for future growth in the developing world\u2019s most populous markets.  \u201c(Netflix) shies away from talking about any one international market too specifically, but it called out growth in Asia, and we believe India is becoming a bigger factor,\u201d said JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth.  \u201cTraction in India for Sacred Games has been strong, along with additional local content Lust Stories, & Ghoul,\u201d he added.

HBO Max launches to a captive audience stuck at home without access to theater, live music, shopping excursions or live or televised sporting events. That situation helped Netflix Inc sign up 15.8 million new paying customers in the first three months of the year, more than double what it expected to attract.  But with film and TV productions halted across the globe, HBO has postponed dozens of releases - most notably a \u201cFriends\u201d reunion special originally planned for launch. If HBO Max does not resume production by this fall, the service could start to see a shortage of original content as early as January, according to a source familiar with the company.  At $15 per month, the service is more expensive than both the $7 per month Disney+ streaming service and the $13 per month standard Netflix plan. Still, WarnerMedia hopes to reach about 80 million global HBO Max subscribers by 2025.  Many existing HBO subscribers in the United States will not need to do anything to get the new service, as WarnerMedia revised deals with distributors including Apple Inc, Charter Communications Inc, Hulu and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and YouTube TV.  But subscribers of HBO through Comcast Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Roku Inc are out of luck as WarnerMedia has yet to strike new agreements.

The telecoms industry has in recent days reported a spike in data traffic on networks as thousands of people were forced to stay home in an attempt to curb the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus, which has infected more than 274,800 people globally and led to the deaths of 11,389 people worldwide.","290":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc NFLX.O scored its first nomination for the prestigious best picture Oscar on Tuesday for \"Roma,\" a milestone that will test whether Hollywood's film establishment is ready to award its top prize to a streaming service.  \u201cRoma\u201d received 10 Academy Award nominations in total, tying \u201cThe Favourite\u201d as the year\u2019s most-nominated film.  A Spanish-language movie, \u201cRoma\u201d chronicles the life of a housekeeper and the family she works for in 1970s Mexico. The movie was filmed in black and white, and was named after the neighborhood in Mexico City where writer, director and cinematographer Alfonso Cuaron grew up.  Awards experts consider \u201cRoma\u201d a front-runner to win best picture at the Oscars ceremony on Feb. 24, though they say it has hurdles to overcome.  After disrupting television, Netflix has stirred unease in the traditional movie industry by encouraging people to skip the theater and watch films at home. Major theater chains refuse to show Netflix films, and some top directors have balked at making films that will be seen primarily on the small screen.  A portion of Oscar voters may be reluctant to honor Netflix, said Hollywood Reporter awards columnist Scott Feinberg, but he believes that group is shrinking. Many actors, writers, producers and others have now worked on Netflix TV shows or movies, and they are happy that the Silicon Valley company has deep pockets and a willingness to fund arthouse fare, he said.  \u201cAt this point they are accepting that they are here, and they are not going away, and they are not the big, bad wolf they were made out to be,\u201d he said.

The company hired a top awards strategist who worked previously for The Weinstein Company, which was known for its masterful Oscar campaigns. Actress Angelina Jolie and other A-list fans of \u201cRoma\u201d have attended screenings, part of an effort to lure voters to see the film on a big screen.  Netflix also showcased the movie on the home screen of its streaming service, something its rivals from traditional studios could not do.  \u201cThere has never been a foreign-language Oscar hopeful that has had the support that this one has,\u201d Feinberg said. \u201cThey have left no stone unturned.\u201d  Cuaron said he was thrilled with Netflix\u2019s backing of an unusual movie with no recognizable stars.  \u201cThey are giving a huge, huge, huge international push for this film, really in both streaming but also theatrical,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cNot any company does that.\u201d  The \u201cRoma\u201d nominations should help Netflix achieve its ultimate goal of adding to its global membership of 139 million streaming customers, particularly overseas where the company is looking for growth, Feinberg said.  \u201cI would imagine in Spanish-speaking countries around the world, it\u2019s been a big point of curiosity to see what this is about,\u201d Feinberg said. \u201cThat will only increase.\u201d  Netflix also received three nominations for Coen brothers Western anthology comedy \u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs\u201d including one for best original song.  \u201cThank you to the Academy for recognizing all those who took creative leaps this past year,\u201d Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in a statement.","291":"(Adds background)  Oct 23 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc said it would stick with the team behind Indian hit show \u201cSacred Games\u201d for a second season after an independent investigation into allegations of sexual harassment against two individuals involved with the show.  In a statement emailed to Reuters, Netflix said it would continue to work with the show\u2019s lead writer Varun Grover, one of two men called out in a wave of #MeToo allegations in India in recent weeks.  It said it would continue to work with directors Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap, whose production house Phantom Films was behind the Mumbai-set thriller and who have not been mentioned in the allegations.  Netflix announced a second season of Sacred Games in September, but ran into trouble earlier this month when Phantom Films disbanded in a cloud of allegations against one of its partners, Vikas Bahl, and Grover.  Both men have denied the allegations.  Bahl was not listed as a producer on the first season.  Netflix gave no details of the outcome of the investigation.  \u201cAfter an independent investigation, the results helped inform Netflix\u2019s decision to continue with Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap on season 2 of Sacred Games,\u201d the company said.  \u201cWe continue to collaborate with our production partners to ensure and maintain a safe and respectful working environment.\u201d  Kashyap, who directed the first season, said in a statement this month on his Twitter account that he regretted not acting on allegations of sexual misconduct made against his partner and producer Bahl in 2015.  The streaming giant launched in India two years ago. It has a library of local content comparable to rivals and scored a big hit in July with the release of \u201cSacred Games\u201d, a hard-boiled thriller built around Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan.

Netflix put the show on hold this month on order of a state court where Sahara alleged violation of Roy\u2019s privacy rights.  Roy is currently on bail in a case where he was ordered by court to repay billions of dollars to investors in a scheme which was found to be illegal. Roy denied wrongdoing in the case and has already repaid investors, his counsel said.  Arguing for free speech in an appeal at the High Court of eastern Bihar state, Netflix said the docuseries was an assimilation of information available in public domain. The filing has not previously been reported.  The pre-publication injunction granted by the court \u201cfreezes free speech,\u201d Netflix said in the filing earlier this month, which was reviewed by Reuters. It argued it has a right to free speech \u201con a matter of public interest.\u201d  Some Netflix shows in India have faced court challenges and police complaints for obscenity or for hurting sentiments. The ongoing legal spat is among the most high-profile ones Netflix has faced in India, one of its key growth markets.  The court in Bihar that gave the injunction earlier had said the series \u201cwould certainly damage the reputation\u201d of Roy. Sahara and Netflix declined to comment. Roy could not be reached for comment.  The U.S. streaming giant has argued it had invested large sums and done worldwide publicity on the series. The injunction, Netflix argued, resulted in irreparable monetary loss, as well as affected its goodwill and reputation.  Netflix describes \u201cBad Boy Billionaires\u201d as an \u201cinvestigative docuseries (which) explores the greed, fraud and corruption that built up - and ultimately brought down - India\u2019s most infamous tycoons.\u201d  Netflix is locked in a legal spat not just with Sahara, but also another businessman Raju whose story was to appear in the series.  Raju, accused of a $1-billion accounting fraud more than a decade ago, had secured a separate state court order against the show\u2019s release, but Netflix has challenged it in a higher court, said A. Venkatesh, a lawyer representing Raju.  Raju will continue to argue against the show\u2019s release, said Venkatesh.  Both Netflix\u2019s appeals are likely to be heard in coming days. It was not clear if the other two tycoons - Modi and Mallya - have filed petitions against the release of the series.  Modi is facing extradition attempts by India after his arrest in London last year over his alleged involvement in a $2 billion bank fraud. Mallya, too, is in Britain fighting India\u2019s extradition bid for alleged fraud at his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.  Modi and Mallya have denied any wrongdoing.  Zulfiquar Memon of Indian law firm MZM Legal, who is part of team representing Modi in his extradition case, said they hadn\u2019t filed any case to halt the release of the series, but were \u201csitting on the fence\u201d tracking the ongoing proceedings.

Investors may have been hoping for more after Netflix announced a price hike for U.S. subscribers earlier this week, usually a sign that demand is strong.  \u201cResults won\u2019t push its stock higher from here, with most of the good news already priced in after a massive rally earlier this month,\u201d said Investing.com senior analyst Haris Anwar.  The company released its massively popular dystopian movie \u201cBird Box\u201d in late December, which helped attract a record 8.8 million new paid streaming customers in the fourth quarter.  Investors, however, appear to have factored that, and the price hike, into their valuation, pushing Netflix shares up more than 50 percent since late December.  The company has staked its future on global expansion and creating original TV shows and movies to hook new customers and keep them paying monthly subscription fees.  But it faces increasing competition from established TV and movie producers such as Walt Disney Co DIS.N, which has stopped supplying new movies to Netflix in order to stock its own streaming service planned for later this year.  AT&T Inc T.N and Comcast Corp CMCSA.O also have digital offerings in the works.  \u201cThe worry is that international bruisers like Disney and Amazon aren\u2019t going to go down without a fight, and both have the financial clout to counterpunch pretty hard,\u201d said George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cThe battle for viewers\u2019 eyeballs is only just getting started.\u201d  Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings played down such competition in a livestreamed interview after the company\u2019s earnings report, as his company now competes with many rivals.  \u201cAny one provider entering only makes a difference on the margin,\u201d he said.

The company estimated that 80 million households will have watched the movie starring Sandra Bullock in its first four weeks, sparking a viral reaction online.  The buzz came during the Christmas holiday season, when sales of phones and internet-connected TVs typically lift Netflix subscriptions.  Netflix said its programming now accounts for about 10 percent of television screen time in the United States, a sign of its popularity but also the room for growth. Total paid streaming subscribers reached 139 million worldwide.  It added an unprecedented 781 hours of U.S. original programming in the United States during the quarter, according to Cowen & Co analysts, including drama series \u201cNarcos: Mexico\u201d and holiday films such as \u201cThe Christmas Chronicles.\u201d  For the fourth quarter, Netflix reported revenue of $4.19 billion for the quarter that ended in December, slightly below the $4.21 billion that Wall Street analysts had forecast, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  It forecast first-quarter revenue of $4.49 billion, slightly below analysts\u2019 average estimate of $4.61 billion. It sees net income of $253 million for the first quarter, well below analysts\u2019 average estimate of $371 million.  Wall Street has come to expect fast-growing Netflix to handily beat forecasts. Without a blowout quarter or ambitious forecast, shares fell 4 percent in after-hours trading to $339.40.  Netflix recently traded at about 83 times expected earnings for the next 12 months. By comparison Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O recently traded at about 60 times earnings and the S&P 500 is trading at around 15 times expected earnings. Stocks trading at high earnings multiples are more prone to sell off if growth targets are missed.  Netflix reported earnings of 30 cents per share for the quarter, lower than a year earlier due to higher spending, but above Wall Street analysts\u2019 average estimate of 24 cents, according to Refinitiv.","302":"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE\/ or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Dow up 0.83%, S&P 500 up 1.39%, Nasdaq up 1.97%  * FAANGs jump after Netflix results beat estimates (Adds closing details; updates prices to close)  Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed at record highs on Wednesday as Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th U.S. president, while solid results from Netflix sparked a rally in shares of \u201cstay-at-home\u201d beneficiaries.  Shares of the world\u2019s largest streaming service Netflix surged 16.85% after the company said it would no longer need to borrow billions of dollars to finance its TV shows and movies.  The rest of the FAANG group, due to report results in the coming weeks, jumped with Google parent Alphabet Inc rising 5.36%. The NYSE FANG+TM index gained 4.77%.  \u201cIt\u2019s a tech outperformance day which is pretty rare over the past two or three months as the cyclical rotation has kind of gotten underway,\u201d said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He added a lot of the move can be traced to Netflix.  \u201c(Today was) just a reminder that the tech run had gotten extended... the FAANG names and some of the other S&P 500 tech names are still incredible operators and are going to be putting out incredible earnings quarters for the foreseeable future,\u201d Mayfield added, referring to Biden\u2019s proposed $1.9 trillion spending plan.  Biden will waste little time turning the page on the Trump era, aides said, signing 15 executive actions in the afternoon on issues ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to the economy to climate change.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure that the politics of inauguration day did much but certainly the expectation for a trillion plus in stimulus,\u201d Mayfield added.  The Dow has gained about 57% and the S&P 500 advanced about 68% since Donald Trump assumed office on Jan. 20, 2017, which compares with a 65% jump in the Dow and 75% gain in the S&P during the first term of the Obama administration.  Wall Street\u2019s main indexes scaled record highs in the past few months, with the blue-chip Dow jumping about 13% since the presidential elections in November, as investors bet on a strong economic recovery in 2021 on the back of COVID-19 vaccine rollout and a bigger pandemic relief plan.  Nearly all of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced in afternoon trading, with communication services, consumer discretionary and technology among the biggest gainers.  Wrapping up results from major U.S. banks, Morgan Stanley slipped 0.2% despite posting quarterly profit that blew past estimates driven by strength in its trading business.  The broader banks index shed about 1.34%, declining for the third day.  With stock market valuations sitting near a 20-year high, investors are hoping corporate results and profit outlooks will help them determine to what degree the valuations are justified.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 257.86 points, or 0.83%, to 31,188.38, the S&P 500 gained 52.94 points, or 1.39%, to 3,851.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 260.07 points, or 1.97%, to 13,457.25.  Procter & Gamble Co raised its full-year sales forecast for a second time as it benefited from sustained coronavirus-driven demand for cleaning products. Its shares, however, fell 1.25% after it warned that the pace of sales might slow as vaccines roll out.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government created the six-member panel in 2018 to examine Canada\u2019s decades-old broadcasting and telecoms laws, and advise the government on how to bring the legislation up to date with the current digital landscape.  The report stated that it was not recommending a so-called \u201cNetflix Tax\u201d by charging consumers an extra levy. Instead, the report recommended requiring online streaming services such as Netflix to \u201cinvest in Canadian programming that they believe will attract and appeal to Canadians.\u201d  Netflix said it looks forward to working with the government as it modernizes Canada\u2019s broadcasting laws.  Facebook said it has long supported \u201ccreation and discoverability\u201d of Canadian content and would continue to invest in the Canadian news ecosystem. The company was reviewing the panel\u2019s recommendations and welcomed \u201congoing dialogue with the Government of Canada on these important subjects,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said.  Amazon declined to comment.  Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, whose department shares responsibility for Canada\u2019s digital laws, said in a statement that \u201creforms are needed to level the playing field on which conventional broadcasters and digital media companies compete.\u201d  He reiterated the government\u2019s commitment on Wednesday to introduce a bill modernizing the country\u2019s broadcasting and telecoms laws before the end of the year.  The Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA) applauded the panel\u2019s recommendations, adding that they would help producers \u201cbring Canadian stories to audiences both at home and around the world,\u201d CMPA President and CEO Reynolds Mastin said.  The report recommended that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) - which regulates media and telecoms companies in Canada - be given a much broader mandate, to include three classes of companies: curation, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime; news aggregators including cable companies and sites like Yahoo! News; and sharing platforms such as Facebook and YouTube.  The panel\u2019s recommendations are not binding.  Canadian companies are legally required to spend a proportion of programming budgets and allocate a set portion of airtime to Canadian content. Curation companies would have to do the same, under the recommended changes, while aggregators and sharers would contribute to Canadian content in a similar way as domestic companies, through levies based on a calculation of Canadian-derived revenues.  The requirement for Canadian broadcasters to ensure a minimum amount of their content is domestic was brought in during the 1970s, to ensure Canadian artists had equal footing on home airwaves with British and American acts.","307":"Oct 6 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc is facing a criminal charge in a Texas county for promoting lewd visuals of a child in the French film \"Cuties\", Texas representative Matt Schaefer said in a tweet here on Tuesday.

That has stirred the first outright concerns among financial investors about the company\u2019s ability to fight deep-pocketed rivals, a feeling that was exacerbated by a shock slide in subscribers last quarter - the first in eight years.  Shares in the company have fallen 22% since that report in mid-July.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Netflix\u2019s advantage is Facebook\u2019s weakness. Subscriptions give the video-streaming service an edge \u2013 and an incentive for boss Reed Hastings to keep customers\u2019 data close by. Cash burn is always a risk but for now Netflix is handily outperforming its FAANG associate.  Netflix is part of the gang of stocks that includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet, but lately it stands out from the pack. The stock was up 60 percent this year as of Monday\u2019s close, more than double second-place Amazon\u2019s rise. Zuckerberg\u2019s dorm-room creation has declined nearly 7 percent over the same period.  The shares jumped another 5 percent following the closing bell after the company reported it added more than 8 million paying customers in the first quarter, giving it a total of nearly 119 million worldwide. Crucially, the company is showing it can boost prices without denting customer growth. For example, it hiked the cost of its mid-level tier subscriptions by $1 to $10.99 in the United States last year.  Netflix\u2019s subscription model contrasts sharply with Facebook, which depends on advertising for nearly all of its $40 billion in annual revenue. Facebook argues that the vast amounts of information it collects on its 2 billion members helps Madison Avenue better target companies\u2019 products and services. A recent data leak that exposed the accounts of 87 million Facebook members suggests that the trade-off may not be fair. While Zuckerberg parried calls for regulation at congressional hearings last week, the risk of political interference continues to hang over the business.  Netflix is a data hound too. It mines the viewing habits of subscribers to suggest other TV shows or produce certain types of movies. That gives Hastings a reason to keep data close to the vest. Netflix doesn\u2019t release ratings.  The producer behind \u201cStranger Things\u201d is not without challenges. Hastings warned that the company is on track to burn up to $4 billion in cash this year and will be cash-flow negative for several more years as it spends heavily on original content. If Netflix fails to attract more people to the service or maintain its ability to raise prices, the model could fray. For now, though, Zuckerberg would love to have Hastings\u2019 problems.","312":"July 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened lower on Thursday as shares of streaming pioneer Netflix tumbled, kicking off earnings for the FAANG group of stocks on a sour note.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Mark Thompson, chief executive of the biggest U.S. newspaper by subscribers, warned that relying on third-party distribution can be dangerous for publishers who risk losing control over their own product.  \u201cWe tend to be quite leery about the idea of almost habituating people to find our journalism somewhere else,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re also generically worried about our journalism being scrambled in a kind of Magimix (blender) with everyone else\u2019s journalism.\u201d  Thompson, who took over as New York Times CEO in 2012 and has overseen a massive expansion in its online readership, warned publishers that they may suffer the same fate as television and film makers in the face of Netflix\u2019s Hollywood insurgence.  \u201cIf I was an American broadcast network, I would have thought twice about giving all of my library to Netflix,\u201d Thompson said in response to questions about any talks with Apple to participate in the iPhone maker\u2019s new news service.  Thompson declined to comment on any conversations with Apple. But he used the tale of how Netflix made huge inroads into Hollywood to explain why the Times has avoided striking deals with digital platforms in which it had little control over relationships with customers or its content.  \u201cEven if Netflix offered you quite a lot of money. ... Does it really make sense to help Netflix build a gigantic base of subscribers to the point where they could actually spend $9 billion a year making their own content and will pay me less and less for my library?\u201d he asked.  In 2007 the answer for Hollywood was yes. In exchange for billions of dollars, studios helped Netflix launch a fledgling streaming video service by licensing their libraries of shows and movies, but that decision may have sown the seeds of their own demise.  By 2016, Time Warner Inc was forced to sell itself to AT&T Inc and Rupert Murdoch sold his 21st Century Fox film and TV studios to Walt Disney Co.  Apple is the latest company to offer a direct-to-consumer streaming video, along with a news subscription service, by leveraging the power of its more than 1 billion devices.  Through its subscription news service, Apple will charge about $10 monthly for access to a variety of magazine and newspaper content, according to media reports. Apple is expected to take 50 percent of the revenue. The Wall Street Journal has agreed to join Apple\u2019s service, according to a recent New York Times report. News Corp, owner of the Journal, was not immediately reachable for comment.  A monthly digital subscription to the New York Times costs $15, and Thompson said he has no plans to give that up to participate on other platforms such as Apple\u2019s.  Last year, the Times generated over $700 million in digital revenue, close to the company\u2019s target of $800 million in annual digital sales by 2020. Digital ad revenue surpassed print ad revenue for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Times has plowed investment back into its newsroom, which at 1,550 journalists is now at its largest ever.  Despite the company\u2019s insistence on keeping readers on its own products and platforms, Thompson said it has experimented on other services, highlighting content the Times developed just for Snap Inc\u2019s Snapchat app, which helped reach new, younger readers.

California-based Netflix currently offers three monthly plans in India, ranging from 500 rupees to 800 rupees, but those are still expensive compared with similar offerings from rivals.  Amazon\u2019s Prime service, which offers video streaming, music and faster shipping of purchases, is priced at 999 rupees a year while local rival Hotstar has a free service as well paid plans starting at 365 rupees a year.

Netflix\u2019s Indian roster includes blockbuster originals such as \u201cSacred Games\u201d, global superhits such as \u201cNarcos\u201d as well as Indian cinema.

Netflix added 670,000 subscribers in the United States, well below analysts\u2019 estimates of 1.19 million, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.

Earlier this month, it debuted its first Indian original series, \u201cSacred Games,\u201d part of a slate of new shows aimed at the vast Bollywood entertainment market.  Netflix said operating margins would be narrower than previously expected because of the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which appreciated by more than 5 percent against major trading partners\u2019 currencies in the second quarter. While most of the company\u2019s revenue growth comes from international markets, the vast majority of its costs remain dollar-denominated.

The developments soured the mood among U.S. investors who had propelled the indexes to record highs last week, encouraged by strong data, the signing of the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal and an upbeat start to fourth-quarter earnings.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq, however, hit a record in late morning trade, helped by positive research recommendations on Tesla Inc and Intel Corp.  Netflix Inc was down 1%, while International Business Machines Corp rose 0.5% ahead of results scheduled after markets close.  71% of the 46 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far, have topped Wall Street\u2019s profit estimates, according to Refinitiv IBES data. However, analysts forecast earnings to have dropped 0.9% in the fourth quarter.  Chinese officials confirmed on Tuesday the new coronavirus outbreak took six lives and that it could spread between humans, stoking fears of a global pandemic and reviving memories of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) \u2014 another outbreak that killed nearly 800 people in 2002-03.  With the virus spreading just ahead of the Chinese New Year holidays, the S&P 1500 airlines index fell 2.6%.  Hotel and casino operators Las Vegas Sands Corp and Wynn Resorts Ltd, both of which have large operations in China, dropped about 4%.  \u201cIt\u2019s one of many factors that investors are considering. But I think focus is going to be on earnings season that\u2019s in front of us,\u201d said Gordon Charlop, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York.  \u201cWe\u2019re watching the Davos, impeachment hearings, but at the moment, there\u2019s nothing terribly remarkable about any of those events.\u201d  At 12:59 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.08% at 29,325.01. The S&P 500 slipped 0.04% to 3,328.33 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.02% to 9,390.69.  Another cause for concern was the International Monetary Fund (IMF) trimming its global growth forecasts for 2020 and 2021, mostly due to a sharper-than-expected slowdown in India and other emerging markets.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.42-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.37-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 85 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 118 new highs and 31 new lows.

Netflix increased the cost of its standard subscription by $1 a month to $14, and the price for the premium tier rose by $2 per month to $18. The standard plan, the company\u2019s most popular, enables two streams at the same time, while the premium plan allows for four simultaneous streams.

Combatting Covid-19 has forced them to close their doors for religious services, but \u201call the ministries are continuing to play a vital role in our communities,\u201d said Pence, who describes himself as a \u201cborn-again, evangelical Catholic.\u201d  Many churches already provide free meals, for example. Ramping that up as millions of people lose their jobs should be a moral obligation, and not just on religious grounds: Churches, synagogues and mosques are more or less exempt from paying taxes, so it\u2019s precisely when Americans fall on hard times that they ought to step up.  But religious institutions are less flush than they used to be: Donations were flat in 2017 and declined in 2018 after years of slow growth, according to Giving USA. As many as 10,000 U.S. churches are dying each year, reckons Missio Alliance.  Pence is right that someone has to pay to help those in need.

Ad-dependent industries in the United States will get clobbered as Covid-19 lockdowns take hold. But the pain won\u2019t be doled out evenly. Morgan Stanley reckons that spending on all manner of advertising, including broadcast television and newspapers, will decline 8% to $210 billion in 2020 from last year. That\u2019s after growing 6% and 9% in the previous two years.  The Wall Street firm\u2019s analysts reckon only internet advertising will snap back, rising nearly 5% in 2021. Total broadcast TV ads are likely to fall 9% this year \u2013 and that\u2019s with spending on the U.S. presidential election propping it up. It also assumes the Summer Olympics in Japan go ahead, which now looks highly unlikely. Next year TV ad spending will probably drop 12%.

With millions working from home, broadband service providers are dealing with unprecedented daytime demand. Traffic is so far comfortably below normal evening peaks, driven mainly by Netflix. Britain\u2019s telecoms\u2019 bosses biggest worry on Monday was 800,000 people tuning in to an online workout with fitness guru Joe Wicks.  Unlike supermarkets, whose supply chains have been up-ended by panic-buying, telecoms networks are benefitting from lots of built-in headroom. This month, BT reported record data traffic of 17.5 Terabits per second (Tbps) when a live-streamed Champions League soccer match clashed with two online game releases. That compares to just 4 Tbps during a normal working day. By slowing some of its highest-resolution streaming, Netflix is erring on the side of caution during a global crisis.

Occidental Petroleum is nearing a settlement with activist Carl Icahn to cede control of two board seats and agree mutually on a third, the Wall Street Journal reported. That kind of weak truce could set a pattern for activism during Covid-19.  Oxy chief Vicki Hollub wrecked her reputation buying Anadarko Petroleum last year and cutting the dividend after the oil price slumped. Adding Icahn-istas to the board isn\u2019t the obvious fix. Hollub is a good operator \u2013 her problem was timing and ambition. Icahn\u2019s reputation isn\u2019t pristine either.

Abano said the buyers have indicated they would be willing to consider an alternative transaction if the MAC occurs. They also can terminate the deal following a consultation. Such M&A provisions are famously hard to invoke and very specific to each contract, but the economic consequences of the pandemic will put them to their biggest test yet, including in the Asia-Pacific region, as Breakingviews noted earlier this month. The toughest questions relate to how severe the crisis impact will be and how long it might last. For dealmakers everywhere, that will make MAC clauses as scary as a root canal.

But despite the plunge in oil prices which has left Brent crude futures trading at little more than $25 a barrel, they left their dividends intact.

Bernstein analysts reckon Shell last cut its dividend during the Great Depression of the early 1930s, though the Anglo-Dutch giant suspended distributions around the period of World War Two and offered shareholders scrip after the 2008 financial crisis.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc T.N in May will launch its HBO Max streaming service with a new \"Game of Thrones\" series at the current HBO price of $15 a month in an aggressive move to battle Netflix, Disney and Apple for the future of TV.  The logo for WarnerMedia's new HBO Max service is seen in this handout photo obtained on October 25, 2019. WarnerMedia\/Handout via REUTERS\/File Photo  The price, which many expected to be higher, surprised the financial analysts and investors attending the WarnerMedia presentation on Tuesday.  HBO Max is expected to reach 75 million to 90 million global subscribers by 2025, with about 50 million of these coming from the United States. The new service is expected to generate about $5 billion in U.S. revenue by 2025.  The stakes are high for AT&T, which is saddled with debt from a $134 billion acquisition spree to combine media conglomerate Time Warner and satellite TV provider DirecTV with the second-largest U.S. wireless phone company by subscribers.  The success of HBO Max is in many ways a referendum on a strategy to merge content with the means to distribute it.  HBO, which invented high-end, subscription programming, is playing catch-up in the streaming era dominated by Netflix.  To compete, AT&T has committed to invest up to $4 billion in additional HBO Max content by 2025, executives said, just a day after reporting tepid media results for the third quarter.  The investment falls far short of its biggest rival Netflix Inc NFLX.O, which has earmarked $15 billion in cash on content spending in 2019. But AT&T and WarnerMedia executives believe they have content and ways to get it in front of consumers that are lacking at Apple Inc AAPL.O, Walt Disney Co DIS.N and Amazon.com AMZN.O.  WarnerMedia Chief Executive John Stankey this month told Reuters that HBO Max will be available this spring to 10 million current AT&T customers in the United States -- a mix of wireless, satellite TV, and some HBO Now subscribers -- at no extra charge.  \u201cThe price point of $14.99 for HBO Max strikes a good balance between not cannibalizing HBO\u2019s existing revenue base, while also addressing the competitive environment in streaming television,\u201d said Sam Hendel, president of Levin Easterly Partners and a portfolio manager at the firm, which owns about 3.5 million shares of AT&T. \u201cThe HBO Max content offering is extremely robust and I think it will be well received by investors and consumers.\u201d  NOT WALMART  From Stage 21 on the Warner Brothers Studio lot in Burbank, California, executives demonstrated the breadth of new original programming and the depth of WarnerMedia\u2019s extensive library of films and TV series. They included the entire collection of DC Universe superhero film franchises from the last decade such as \u201cBatman\u201d and recent box office hits such as \u201cJoker\u201d that will be available within the first year of its launch. WarnerMedia also secured the U.S. streaming rights to \u201cSouth Park.\u201d  To court new viewers, WarnerMedia executives said they will introduce 88 original series in 2021, 38 from HBO and 50 under the category it called \u201cMax Originals\u201d that will target younger audiences.  Executives announced a batch of new shows from high-profile producers and directors including \u201cRaised by Wolves\u201d by \u201cAlien\u201d filmmaker Ridley Scott about androids raising human children and \u201cCollege Girls\u201d from comedian, actress and writer Mindy Kaling.  Ahead of the presentation, HBO canceled a much-anticipated prequel to the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d starring Naomi Watts, one source familiar with the matter said, confirming reports in Hollywood media.  Instead, WarnerMedia executives announced 10 episodes of a new \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d prequel called \u201cHouse of Dragons.\u201d The series will be set 300 years before the events of the just-concluded series and is based on author George R.R. Martin\u2019s book \u201cFire & Blood.\u201d  Although the Warner Brothers library includes popular content like \u201cThe Shining\u201d and \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d -- and the HBO brand is known for edgy, high-quality programming -- it does not have the same brand awareness as Pixar, Marvel or Disney properties that will be included in the Disney+ streaming service that launches Nov. 12.  And as one of the latest entries in the streaming wars, HBO Max will be competing for household dollars that may have already been allocated to rivals.  WarnerMedia is hoping that with HBO Max, it can continue serving HBO\u2019s core over-40 audience, and expand to include younger viewers who may prefer to stream content and do not want to pay for cable.  \u201cThis is not Netflix. This is not Disney. This is uniquely HBO Max,\u201d AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said.","328":"LONDON (Reuters) - Oscar winner Gary Oldman goes back to 1930s Hollywood in Netflix film \u201cMank\u201d, playing screenwriter Herman J.

Under the name Higher Ground Productions, the Obamas have the option to produce scripted and unscripted series, documentaries and feature films, Netflix said in a statement.  The Obamas will have hands-on involvement in producing content and will appear personally in some of the shows while curating others, said a person familiar with the deal.  Terms of the multi-year deal were not disclosed and the first of the programming is not expected to reach viewers until about May 2019, the person said.  The agreement between the Obamas and Netflix, which boasts some 125 million subscribers worldwide, is a first for any occupant of the White House.  The closest comparison is former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, whose global warming documentary \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d won an Oscar in 2007. Gore also launched a youth-oriented cable TV network, Current TV, in 2005 but it was sold to Middle-East based Al Jazeera in 2013, which later shut it down.  The Obamas gave no details of the topics they planned to cover but the content is not expected to be directly political.  Barack Obama in a statement recalled the \u201cfascinating people\u201d from all walks of life that he had met during his eight years in office, ending in January 2017.  \u201cWe hope to cultivate and curate the talented, inspiring, creative voices who are able to promote greater empathy and understanding between peoples, and help them share their stories with the entire world,\u201d he added.  Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said in a statement that the Obamas are \u201cuniquely positioned to discover and highlight stories of people who make a difference in their communities and strive to change the world for the better.\u201d  The deal with the Obamas also marks one of the biggest coups for Netflix in drawing top-level talent away from traditional Hollywood studios and television networks.

Lowe said last summer that he was closing Wynewood under pressure from animal rights activists and inspectors and had moved some 160 big cats his new facility.  The federal court on Jan. 15 found that two tiger cubs had died less than a week apart because of a failure by the Lowes to provide proper nutrition and veterinary care.

REUTERS\/Monica Almeida  Netflix, which films TV shows like crime drama \u201cOzark\u201d and supernatural thriller \u201cStranger Things\u201d in the U.S. state, said it would work with groups fighting the Georgia law through the U.S. courts.  The company was the first major Hollywood producer to publicly comment on calls by some for an industry boycott of Georgia. The industry is responsible for more than 92,000 jobs in Georgia, according to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), and some 455 film and TV shows were shot in the state in 2018, according to then-Governor Nathan Deal.  Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, said Netflix had many women working on productions in Georgia and their rights would be restricted by the new law.  \u201cIt\u2019s why we will work with the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) and others to fight it in court. Given the legislation has not yet been implemented, we\u2019ll continue to film there - while also supporting partners and artists who choose not to. Should it ever come into effect, we\u2019d rethink our entire investment in Georgia,\u201d Sarandos said in a statement.  Georgia is one of eight states to pass anti-abortion legislation this year seeking to induce the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark case that established a woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy.. The Georgia law comes into effect on Jan. 1.  Calls by some in Hollywood for a boycott of Georgia have so far failed to gain widespread support, with most studios and platforms remaining silent. That contrasts with a boycott of North Carolina over its transgender bathroom law that was supported by businesses, sports leagues and celebrities like Bruce Springsteen and led to the repeal of the law in 2017.  A number of producers and actors have said they will donate money to local groups fighting the abortion law, rather than boycott and cause people in Georgia to lose work.  However the makers of an upcoming comedy starring Kristen Wiig decided last week not to shoot in Georgia. While work on \u201cOzark\u201d season three began in Georgia earlier this month, star and executive producer Jason Bateman said that if the abortion bill became law he would not work in Georgia.  According to the Georgia film office website on Monday, 38 movies or TV shows are currently in production in the state. Past productions include the TV series \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and scenes from the 2018 superhero movie \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d","336":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Netflix Inc on Tuesday appointed Bozoma Saint John as the streaming giant\u2019s chief marketing officer, starting in August, adding a high-profile Black executive to senior management.

Investors should watch for how Netflix responds to competition, its subscriber count and forecast, and any comments about global pricing, its shrinking library of licensed programming and its original-content strategy.  NEW COMPETITORS  Although the coming entry of Walt Disney Co, AT&T Inc and Apple Inc into the streaming wars could dampen Netflix\u2019s U.S. growth, experts do not see this as a zero-sum game.  Subscribers are likely to choose multiple online video options instead of picking just one. The Disney+ streaming service is expected to share 80% of Netflix\u2019s customers, said analysts at Raymond James and Associates.  \u201cNetflix forms the central piece of the digital bundle,\u201d the analysts said.  Netflix\u2019s wide range of content keeps the company safe from being replaced, said Cowen analyst John Blackledge, who called fears of new competitors \u201coverdone.\u201d  SUBSCRIBERS  The larger share of Netflix\u2019s growth is coming from markets outside the United States. The company forecasts that it added 5 million paid streaming customers from April through June, with 4.7 million coming from international markets.  Some analysts believe that as more well-funded streaming services enter the market, Netflix\u2019s subscriber growth rate will slow. The third-quarter forecast will be a key metric for shareholders.  INTERNATIONAL PRICING  Netflix raised prices in Britain, Switzerland, Greece and Western Europe during the second quarter.  With more cash from higher prices, Netflix could use the money to secure new deals for original content or licensing contracts. Analysts said language options and localized content will have a huge impact on growth in international markets.  SHRINKING LIBRARY  Hit shows \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d will leave Netflix in 2020 and 2021, respectively, putting more pressure on the company to entice fans with original programming such as \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cWhen They See Us.\u201d Investors should watch for the amount Netflix plans to spend on original programming and whether the company plans to close fewer licensing deals.  ORIGINAL CONTENT  More original projects are coming to Netflix including partnerships with \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d creator Shonda Rhimes.  \u201c2020 will see the fruit of Netflix\u2019s production deals,\u201d said Justin Patterson, an analyst at Raymond James.

Chief Executive Tim Cook unveiled a dizzying array of new subscription services on Monday that cover news, television and gaming. The $880 billion tech firm introduced a credit card too. The offerings ranged from confusing to mildly innovative.  The bar for Apple launches was set high more than a decade ago by the iPhone. It was revolutionary and destructive. Nearly all the leading handset makers at the time \u2013 Blackberry, Nokia, Motorola \u2013 saw their businesses upended.  The slowdown in iPhone sales justifies switching from device sales \u2013 which still make up almost $9 of every $10 Apple makes \u2013 to subscriptions. That\u2019s where the new products come in. News Plus offers 300 magazine titles like People and Cosmopolitan and a smattering of newspapers for some $10 a month. Nice, but hardly comprehensive. The New York Times and the Washington Post are notably absent. Separately, Apple is also getting into gaming.  Where Cook has his work cut out is in taking on Netflix, the video streaming company. After 10 years of tinkering, Apple has now gone all-in with a service endorsed by Hollywood stars like Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg. But Apple TV Plus is a mashup of different tiers, channels and partnerships \u2013 far from simple.  More promising is the Goldman Sachs-backed credit card. Apple is touting ease, security, convenience and cash incentives to lure in customers. It comes with novelties like having no card number. It could at least push entrenched financial players JPMorgan, Capital One, Bank of America and Citigroup to up their game. But it\u2019s hardly industry-changing, or likely to unseat the oligopoly. Those four already have more than half the U.S. market, according to Accenture data.  The trouble is nothing that was revealed in Cook\u2019s two-hour event on Monday was a must-have for consumers. That\u2019s reflected in the market response \u2013 neither Apple\u2019s shares, nor those of targets like Walt Disney, Netflix or the big banks, moved much.

Based on the book by John Preston, the Netflix film, released on Friday, recounts the 1939 Sutton Hoo archaeological discovery, described by Britain\u2019s National Trust as a find that \u201cwould revolutionise our understanding of early England\u201d.  Set at the onset of World War Two, it follows Edith Pretty, a widowed landowner in the eastern county of Suffolk, as she employs amateur archaeologist Basil Brown, played by Fiennes, to excavate mounds on her property both suspect are Viking burial grounds.  Instead, Brown unearthed the shape of a 27-metre long Anglo-Saxon ship with a burial chamber filled with treasures.  Mulligan, known for \u201cFar From the Madding Crowd\u201d and \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d, said she had not been looking for another period drama role but was moved by the script and keen to work with \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d actor Fiennes.  That came with great responsibility. In one scene, Brown is buried under thick mud when a trench he is excavating collapses. Pretty, played by Mulligan, uses her bare hands to dig him out.  \u201c(I felt) terror. Ralph didn\u2019t want to use a stuntman, which I totally get, but it just did leave me with the terrible task of trying to stop him from suffocating,\u201d Mulligan told Reuters.

So it was really stressful.\u201d  Fiennes came out unscathed.  Adding a sense of authenticity, Stone asked the crew to bury mock-up treasures to replicate the excitement around the original discovery.  \u201cWe buried the treasure that they find and we hid it from them ... And so they went on a treasure hunt,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took hours and we were just rolling and rolling and rolling and sometimes there\u2019d be long periods where no one found anything.\u201d  Fiennes actually unearthed some medieval pottery while digging on set outside London.  \u201cIt was like a bit of clay,\u201d he said, adding he hoped audiences would be inspired by the film\u2019s small details.  \u201cWe live in a world of mass production ... some of these (Sutton Hoo) treasures ... are stunning pieces of craftsmanship.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Nearly a decade ago, former Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes derisively called Netflix the \u201cAlbanian army,\u201d implying the video-streaming service would never take over the world. \u201cThe mouse that roared\u201d is more like it.  Like the fictional European duchy in the 1959 film that declared war on the United States with a ragtag army, and won, Netflix outfoxed far-bigger rivals to achieve dominance. Now chief Reed Hastings is claiming his booty. The company on Tuesday bumped up the cost of its domestic subscriptions by as much as 18 percent. It\u2019s the third hike in five years for its most popular plan, now priced at $12.99 a month.  Sure, the increase amounts to only $1 to $2 a month, but Netflix has stumbled in the past with such tactics. Nearly three years ago it missed its subscriber growth forecast after lamely trying to pass off a price hike as a move to \u201cun-grandfather\u201d longtime customers.  That Hastings feels comfortable to charge more just as competition is heating up says something. On Monday, Comcast\u2019s NBC Universal announced plans for its direct-to-consumer offering. AT&T and Walt Disney are preparing to launch their own streaming services. Hulu, with its hydra-headed owners the Mouse House, Comcast and AT&T, announced it has more than 25 million subscribers in the United States \u2013 approaching half of Netflix\u2019s count. But it\u2019s losing money too, some $1.7 billion, Breakingviews estimates, based on owners\u2019 filings.  Burning through an estimated $3 billion to $4 billion in 2018 is one reason Netflix wants to get more from its subscribers. Moody\u2019s reckons the company will achieve breakeven cash flow by 2023. It is spending to ramp up its trove of original content like \u201cBird Box\u201d as media giants like Disney withhold TV shows and movies from the service. Still, Netflix is profitable and has more than 135 million customers around the world, giving it an enormous advantage.  There is plenty of room for consumers to subscribe to a few video services. So far though, Netflix is top of mind. It will be the end of this year before traditional media players release competing streaming services. NBC, AT&T and Disney will be fighting for second or third place \u2014 if they place at all. Talk about Albanian armies.","361":"LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - \u201cSocial Distance,\u201d a new Netflix anthology series comprised of short vignettes of life in the early days of the COVID-19 crisis in the U.S., presents critics as well as viewers with a conundrum.  On the one hand, it is, in the main, unimpeachably made: Using isolation-appropriate technology like Zoom and Nest cameras to tell what are generally sweet and thoughtful little tales of human connection, or disconnection, at a time of crisis, the show is a worthy use of Netflix resources. But is it worth watching? Only for those eager to relive what were for most of us months of dislocation and pain. This is simultaneously a creative response to the trauma of the past year and not quite transformative enough to possibly be recommended on grounds other than masochistic completism, a curiosity about how TV is addressing its moment that leaves the viewer\u2019s comfort aside.  To wit: The show\u2019s eight episodes take place entirely in the months of April and May of this year; not that things are good today, but the early days of confusing misinformation and early attempts to come to terms with how we were forced to live now were misery.  This viewer felt a painful, tooth-grinding familiarity at jokes about a relative being accidentally muted in one episode, which takes place during a Zoom funeral. It\u2019s an occasion just loopy enough to look slightly different from the ways all of us used Zoom, and yet not quite removed enough to be novel, or to say something unexpected.  What purpose does simply being true-to-life serve when the truth being depicted, of our society-wide enforced isolation, is still so fresh and so raw? Aspects of the episode (with an ensemble cast led by Oscar Nunez) were funny enough, but there didn\u2019t seem to be enough of a meaningful takeaway -- members of this squabbling family ultimately vow to get together when they can -- to justify the sit.  So it goes throughout the first six episodes: Frank and open-hearted conversations that tend to deliver us to a terminus we might have reasonably expected.  This show is created by \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d writer Hilary Weisman Graham and executive-produced by Jenji Kohan, and it shares \u201cOrange\u2019s\u201d impulse towards wringing something of worth out of national cataclysm. But that prison drama had the good fortune of working with characters we came to know over years: What happened to them felt less didactic, because these were people we knew, not just people getting us to the punchline.  The show\u2019s multifarious curiosity -- about, say, a gay couple (Brian Jordan Alvarez and Max Jenkins) exploring their curiosity about monogamy in quarantine, or about a nurse (Danielle Brooks) trying to balance her elder client with the need to raise her daughter -- is admirable.  But in those cases and others, the show\u2019s unique staging, using footage that might have been captured through these unhappy folks\u2019 smartphones and computers, tends to expose how laboriously built towards a pithy moral lesson these stories are.  Creative though the means of depicting these lives through consumer technology is, it also exposes each story\u2019s every weak spot, up to and including that having done so much work to set up these moral tales, the show tends to have little to say.  Relationships are affirming, when all parties involved put in the work. It\u2019s difficult not to see those we love. COVID-19 has made life really crazy; things are hard. The series moves towards addressing the national uprising around racial justice towards its conclusion, both effectively (through the story of a young man played by Asante Blackk and his coming into consciousness around racial justice) and less so (another character\u2019s travails come to seem vastly less significant to them when they learn of the killing of George Floyd -- a real phenomenon perhaps, but a rather trite and unworthy use of real footage of national upheaval to generate the contrast).  And yet the attempt is admirable. TV as a medium is agile enough to have produced a show that stands as a response to the events of this year, which is a start: The first draft of the prestige-streamer show about the COVID-19 era is now complete, and someone had to do it. (In aspects, this series resembles the remotely-shot HBO series of monologues \u201cCoastal Elites,\u201d although that show was based on work the screenwriter Paul Rudnick had written before the pandemic: This is, then, a first of a sort.)  What lies ahead for TV are shows that integrate the isolation and loneliness of 2020 into the lives of existing characters, or that do so in search simply of the truth rather than the carefully constructed ending notes of each \u201cSocial Distance\u201d episodes.  \u201cSocial Distance\u201d has shown what some first steps towards a culture-wide artistic response to the moment might be, once enough time has passed that we want to relive this past spring and that artists can respond in a deeper way. It also shows us what are the pitfalls of responding too soon.","362":"LAGOS (Reuters) - Indian-Nigerian restaurant owner Hamisha Daryani Ahuja gave up her long-running business to pursue her dream of making movies.

Netflix subscriber churn rates began to rise Sept. 10, the day after the release of \u201cCuties\u201d on Netflix, when the hashtag \u201c#CancelNetflix\u201d was in the top-trending spot on Twitter, according to data compiled by YipitData.  On Saturday, Sept. 12, Netflix\u2019s cancellation rate in the U.S. jumped to nearly eight times higher than the average daily levels recorded in August 2020 -- reaching a multiyear high, the data-analytics provider told Variety. With the #CancelNetflix hashtag continuing to trend on social media, it is possible elevated churn could continue in the coming days, according to the firm.  It\u2019s unclear, however, how big an impact that will have on Netflix\u2019s overall subscriber base; YipitData declined to provide estimates on the number of customers who canceled. Customers regularly drop Netflix and other subscription services (a metric referred to as \u201cchurn rate\u201d), and the YipitData numbers may ultimately reflect a short-term blip in U.S. cancellations that is relatively minor in a grand scheme of things. As of the end of June, the company tallied 193 million paid streaming customers worldwide. That\u2019s after Netflix netted about 25.9 million new subscribers worldwide in the first six months of 2020, with the coronavirus pandemic spurring record signups.  New York-based YipitData, which sells information to institutional investors, aggregates and analyzes data sets that track the behavior of millions of U.S. consumers including from panels for email receipts, online transactions, app data, and web traffic.  Netflix has defended \u201cCuties,\u201d written and directed by award-winning French filmmaker Maimouna Doucoure, arguing that it is a \u201csocial commentary\u201d that makes the case about the dangers of sexualized imagery of young girls. The streamer has urged those who have denounced the film to watch it.  \u201cCuties\u201d follows an 11-year-old Senegalese girl living in Paris who joins a \u201cfree-spirited dance crew\u201d (called \u201cthe Cuties\u201d) to rebel against what she perceives as her Muslim family\u2019s oppressive traditions. In the film, the conflicted protagonist, Amy, and the Cuties perform dance routines in which they simulate sex, and in the scenes the camera shots focus on their crotch areas. It also portrays preteen characters in other sexual situations. For example, in one scene, Amy takes a picture of her genitals and then posts the photo on social media (although no explicit images are shown); earlier in the same scene, she makes a sexual come-on to her adult cousin to avoid getting punished for stealing his phone.  Doucoure, speaking Monday on a panel hosted by French cinema promotional org UniFrance, said that her film shows why it is necessary to create solutions addressing the \u201chyper-sexualization of children\u201d that occurs via social media across the globe.  \u201cWe need to protect our children. What I want to is to open people\u2019s eyes on this issue and try to fix it,\u201d she said.  The film has been among the top-viewed movies on Netflix since its release, undoubtedly fueled by the controversy surrounding it. On Tuesday, Sept. 15, \u201cCuties\u201d was the No. 4 most popular film in the U.S. on Netflix, behind animated kids\u2019 movie \u201cPets United,\u201d documentary \u201cThe Social Dilemma\u201d and horror film \u201cThe Babysitter: Killer Queen.\u201d That Netflix ranking is based on how many members watched at least two minutes of a title.  \u201cCuties\u201d (\u201cMignonnes\u201d) premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the world cinema dramatic directing award. Netflix acquired worldwide rights (excluding France) prior to its Sundance screening. The movie is rated \u201cTV-MA\u201d (for mature audiences) for explicit language.  In August 2020, Netflix caused an uproar after its released a promotional poster for \u201cCuties,\u201d depicting the young cast members in provocative poses. The company apologized for the \u201cinappropriate artwork\u201d and said it was not representative of the film. \u201cThe controversy started with that artwork,\u201d Doucoure said Monday. \u201cThe most important is to watch the film and understand we have the same fight.\u201d  The anti-\u201cCuties\u201d campaign has been linked to the QAnon conspiracy and disinformation movement. Several right-wing U.S. politicians have stoked the flames of the backlash, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who attacked the film as \u201cchild porn\u201d and called on the DOJ to investigate Netflix for potential violations of U.S. law. The senator has not seen the film, according to a Cruz representative, who added, \u201cThere should be absolutely no place for the filming and distribution of these scenes -- regardless of the purported objective of the filmmaker.\u201d  On Tuesday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) issued a statement calling on Netflix to remove \u201cCuties\u201d from its platform \u201cdue to the movie\u2019s disturbing sexualization of children as well as its offensive and stereotypical depiction of Islam and Muslims.\u201d  Last week, media watchdog group Parents Television Council also condemned \u201cCuties.\u201d In addition, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) said Netflix should either delete the film\u2019s \u201csexually exploitative scenes\u201d or pull the film.  \u201cWhile we commend director Maimouna Doucoure for exposing the very real threats to young girls having unfettered access to social media and the internet, we cannot condone the hyper-sexualization and exploitation of the young actresses themselves in order to make her point,\u201d Lina Nealon, NCOSE\u2019s director of corporate and strategic initiatives, said in a statement. \u201cThe audience does not need to see the very long scenes with close-up shots of the girls\u2019 bodies; this does nothing to educate the audience on the harms of sexualization.\u201d","368":"MUMBAI (Reuters) - A new Netflix show about an Indian matchmaker catering to the high demands of potential brides and grooms, and their parents, has stoked an online debate about arranged marriages in the country.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The eight-part series \u201cIndian Matchmaking\u201d premiered on Netflix on Thursday and is currently among its top ranked India shows. It features Sima Taparia, a real-life matchmaker from Mumbai, who offers her services to families within India and abroad.  Arranged marriages in India see parents leading efforts to find a suitable match for their children. The show has become a subject of memes and jokes, and criticism, on how individuals and their parents are picky and have a long list of demands that centre around factors like caste, height or skin colour.  The show \u201cmakes very clear how regressive Indian communities can be. Where sexism, casteism, and classism are a prevalent part of the process of finding a life partner,\u201d wrote Twitter user Maunika Gowardhan.  Thousands of Twitter and Instagram posts echo that view. \u201cThe show is simply holding a mirror to the ugly society we are a part of,\u201d Vishaka George, another Twitter user, wrote.  Created by Oscar-nominated director Smriti Mundhra, the show focuses on matchmaker Taparia\u2019s visits to the homes of families who need her assistance. After hearing their demands, she presents r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of prospective matches and then arranges for meetings.  \u201cThe two families have their reputation and many millions of dollars at stake. So the parents guide their children,\u201d Taparia says at one point in the show, referring to some of her wealthier clients.  In the first episode titled \u201cSlim, Trim and Educated\u201d, an Indian mother tells Taparia her son is getting a lot of marriage proposals but in most cases the prospective bride\u2019s education or height was not ideal.  Just as Taparia says: \u201cSo you want a smart, outgoing, height ...\u201d the mother interjects, \u201cI won\u2019t even consider (a girl) below 5 feet 3 inches.\u201d  Some have praised the show for its honesty and treating its subjects respectfully.  \u201cThe hate against it is, frankly, baffling ... Indian Matchmaking is well on its way to becoming a cultural phenomenon,\u201d a column in the Mint newspaper said."}}
