euro up  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs\/2egbfVh  By Laila Kearney  NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - World stocks rallied on Friday, with Wall Street opening higher and European indexes recovering from a volatile week pegged to a growing U.S.-led trade battle with other top global economies, with those concerns pushed to the backburner for now.  Bank shares jumped after U.S. lenders cleared the second part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress test, pushing the sector 0.88 percent higher after it broke a 13-day losing streak on Thursday, and helping U.S. stocks to recover some losses.  Nike also pushed U.S benchmark indexes higher after the world\u2019s largest sneaker maker surged as much as 11.5 percent to a record peak on a strong earnings report.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 276.37 points, or 1.14 percent, to 24,492.42, the S&P 500 gained 25.57 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,741.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 66.24 points, or 0.88 percent, to 7,569.92.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.20 percent.  Earlier, the U.S. stock market briefly dipped on a report by the Axios news website that indicated President Donald Trump was keen for the U.S. to withdraw from the World Trade Organization; the market recovered after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business Network the report was wrong. The Axios report cited people involved in talks with Trump.  The market\u2019s wobbling was a reminder of heightened investor sensitivity to trade-related remarks or developments.  \u201cThe markets are very much subject to headlines on trade and tariffs,\u201d said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.  \u201cThey are important from the standpoint that trade globalization has been the cornerstone for growth and when you do something to sort of undermine that cornerstone, that\u2019s a reasonable reason for concern.\u201d  The U.S. administration is due to impose tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion beginning July 6, likely prompting a tit-for-tat response from Beijing.  The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.13 percent.  The euro was set for its strongest day in a month after leaders at an EU summit reached an agreement on migration, rising 0.8 percent to $1.1658. The agreement eased a threat to German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s ruling coalition over the issue.  While Asian stocks rose, the Chinese yuan suffered its worst month on record, losing 3 percent against the dollar in June as investors pulled money from a market likely to suffer from higher barriers to trade.  The U.S. dollar was set for its strongest quarterly gains since the fourth quarter of 2016, helped by the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s move to raise interest rates in June, and expectations of further hikes this year.  The dollar index, tracking it against six major currencies, edged down 0.6 percent to 94.787 as the euro rose.  The yield curve between two-year and 10-year U.S. notes flattened to 31 basis points, the flattest since 2007, after U.S. consumer spending data disappointed some analysts\u2019 expectations. Some investors see its flattening as a sign recession may be around the corner.  Oil prices extended gains to fresh highs on a tighter market as U.S. sanctions against Iran threatened to remove a substantial volume of crude oil from world markets amid rising demand.  Brent crude rose 2 percent to $79.51 per barrel, while U.S. crude added 0.6 percent to $73.90, its highest since November 2014.","1":"Dec 18 (Reuters) - Nike Inc beat estimates for quarterly revenue on Friday, helped by a jump in online demand for sports shoes and apparel as more people engaged in fitness-related activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The world\u2019s largest sportswear maker said revenue rose to $11.24 billion in the second quarter ended Nov. 30 from $10.33 billion a year earlier, while analysts on average had expected $10.56 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (Reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D\u2019Silva)","2":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart\u2019s Jet.com said on Thursday it will sell Nike Inc products and offer more delivery options, beginning in its top market of New York City, in a bid to sharpen its aim for affluent, urban consumers and better compete with e-commerce rivals like Amazon.com Inc.  Walmart Inc acquired Jet for $3.3 billion in August 2016, a deal that was widely considered a watershed moment for its then-struggling e-commerce operation as it got access to both technology and talent through Jet founder Marc Lore and his team.  \u201cWe both had a keen interest in serving that urban affluent customer,\u201d said Jet\u2019s chief customer officer, David Echegoyen. The relationship with Nike, scheduled for kick-off in October, would \u201cbring customers on Jet a set of everything,\u201d he added.  Nike launched a pilot to sell footwear and apparel on Amazon last year, in a dramatic turnaround after long steering clear of the world\u2019s largest online retailer. That partnership was a signal that Amazon was serious about fighting counterfeit goods on its site and was courting once weary fashion brands. This summer, Nike\u2019s chief executive officer told analysts on a conference call that the partnership was \u201cprogressing well.\u201d  Jet\u2019s relationship with Nike is less about the Nike product and more about how consumers go about discovering a sneaker or running shoe, Jet executives said.  Jet said it is still finalizing the line-up of Nike products to be offered on the site.Jet is separately courting urban millennial customers through initiatives in another category: grocery. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing a grocery experience together with a fashion experience with a home experience that customers can check out in one cart,\u201d Jet\u2019s CEO, Simon Belsham, said.  Through Parcel, the last-mile delivery tech company acquired by Walmart in 2017, most New York City consumers will be able to arrange three-hour scheduled delivery windows for groceries - now including fresh produce - and other merchandise from local shops.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Jet said it is making plans to offer these delivery options nationwide, but will first test them in New York City.  Jet executives said the initiatives were not in response to Amazon Prime Now, the company\u2019s two-hour delivery service that lets customers shop Whole Foods and other local stores in cities around the world.  Many analysts view Amazon as unmatched in handling distribution and delivery for non-perishable goods, meaning other e-commerce players may be challenged to offer the same level of service.  Amazon has more than 150 fulfillment centers around the world, the company has said.","3":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The judge overseeing Michael Avenatti\u2019s extortion trial said the case should not focus on Nike Inc\u2019s alleged corruption or devolve into celebrity name-dropping, as jury selection began for the case against the lawyer and critic of U.S. President Donald Trump.  FILE PHOTO: Attorney Michael Avenatti arrives at United States Court in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., July 23, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  Prosecutors accused Avenatti, 48, of trying to shake down Nike for up to $25 million by threatening to publicize accusations it illegally paid families of college basketball recruits, unless it hired him and another celebrity lawyer, Mark Geragos, to conduct an internal probe.  Avenatti countered that he was simply doing his job representing a whistleblowing coach in negotiations with Nike.  Prosecutors said he also defrauded the coach by concealing a settlement offer made by Nike, because Avenatti was heavily in debt and wanted millions of dollars for himself.  Avenatti has pleaded not guilty. Nike has denied wrongdoing.  Outside the presence of prospective jurors, the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan, made clear that the trial should be about Avenatti and not whether Nike undertook a \u201clarge-scale effort to corrupt college basketball.\u201d  Gardephe also said Avenatti\u2019s lawyers cannot mention by name Colin Kaepernick, who Geragos had represented in separate negotiations with Nike, calling the football quarterback a \u201cdivisive figure.\u201d  The judge also said Avenatti\u2019s lawyers cannot mention several other well-known people at trial, agreeing with prosecutors that jurors might be confused.  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get into R. Kelly, we\u2019re not going to get into Jeffrey Epstein, we\u2019re not going to get into Rudy Giuliani,\u201d Gardephe said, referring respectively to the singer, late registered sex offender, and lawyer for Trump.  Geragos is not expected to testify.  Avenatti has been jailed since Jan. 17 in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan for a suspected bail violation in a separate case.  He was stone-faced and kept his hands behind his back as roughly 120 prospective jurors entered a courtroom to fill out questionnaires for the trial, which they were told should last 2-1\/2 weeks.  Gardephe told jurors that nothing ever written or said about Avenatti \u201cmatters at all\u201d at the trial.  \u201cIn our country, we don\u2019t try people in the press,\u201d he said.  Jury selection continues on Tuesday.  Avenatti became famous representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Trump.  He faces separate criminal trials in April for allegedly defrauding Daniels out of nearly $300,000 from a book contract, and in May for defrauding other clients and lying to the Internal Revenue Service and a bankruptcy court.","4":"(Reuters) - Sportswear maker Under Armour Inc UA.NUAA.N on Tuesday cut its full-year revenue forecast for North America as demand at its stores and online faced pressure from relentless competition from bigger rivals Nike and Adidas.  Shares of the company fell as much as 20% as it struggles to stand out in the United States, its biggest market, where it has been introducing products such as new Curry sneaker and HOVR shoes at a faster pace to shore up market share.  Under Armour has also been opening more company-owned stores and beefing up its online business, but the strategy failed to deliver in the quarter, with North America sales falling 3%. In contrast, Nike reported a 7% rise in sales from the region in the last reported quarter.  \u201cWith the sports apparel space becoming increasingly crowded, Under Armour needs to carve out a more distinct and edgy position,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director at research firm GlobalData.  Chief Operating Officer Patrik Frisk said in a post earnings call that while more customers visited its app and website, that did not translate into sales.  \u201cIn direct-to-consumer, we\u2019re experiencing softer than anticipated demand,\u201d Frisk said, adding that sales volume at its stores were also weak.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work that we\u2019re putting into getting better from an e-commerce digital perspective.\u201d  Nike and Adidas have pumped money into its online businesses, which have been driving their strong results.  While online sales for Adidas grew 40% in the latest reported quarter, Under Armour\u2019s direct-to-consumer unit grew just 2% in the quarter.  The Baltimore-based firm said it now expected a slight decline in North America revenue for fiscal 2019 compared with a prior forecast of flat revenue.  However, it stuck to its overall growth target on higher demand for shoes and apparel abroad as higher spending in international markets powered growth in Europe and Asia Pacific.  The company\u2019s net loss narrowed to $17.3 million in the quarter ended June 30. Excluding certain items, Under Armour posted a loss of 3 cents per share, while analysts were expecting a loss of 5 cents.  Net revenue rose about 1% to $1.19 billion roughly in line with analysts\u2019 expectation.  Class A shares of the company have risen 55% so far this year and were trading at $23.69, down 13%.","5":"March 22 (Reuters) -  * BILL ACKMAN CASHES OUT OF NIKE INVESTMENT WITH ROUGHLY $100 MILLION PROFIT - SOURCE Further company coverage:","6":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Monday rejected Michael Avenatti\u2019s claim that they overwhelmed him with large amounts of material for the Jan. 21 trial accusing the celebrity lawyer of trying to extort Nike Inc, and that the material should be excluded or the trial delayed by 30 days.  FILE PHOTO: Attorney Michael Avenatti exits the United States Courthouse in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 8, 2019.

In response, Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said there was no delay in delivering the documents, even \u201cto gain some kind of advantage.\u201d  He also accused Avenatti of seeking to use the documents as part of \u201can improper effort to blame the victim,\u201d Nike, and \u201cdistract the jury from the only question before it: the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d  U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe oversees Avenatti\u2019s case and will decide what should be done.  Avenatti became known for representing porn star Stormy Daniels and criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump.  He was charged with threatening to hold a news conference discussing Nike\u2019s alleged improper payments to college basketball recruits unless the athletic wear company paid his client, youth basketball coach Gary Franklin, $1.5 million and paid Avenatti up to $25 million to conduct an internal probe.  Prosecutors also charged Avenatti with failing to tell Franklin that Nike offered to settle the coach\u2019s claims without paying Avenatti, costing the lawyer money.  Avenatti has pleaded not guilty. Nike has denied wrongdoing.  In his filing, Avenatti also said evidence to support prosecutors\u2019 claim he was at least $15 million in debt when he dealt with Nike, giving him a possible motive to extort, could \u201coverwhelm the trial\u201d and should be excluded.  He cited, among other things, prosecutors\u2019 plan to call a former divorce lawyer for his estranged wife as a witness.  Prosecutors countered that Avenatti made his own finances an issue, in part by offering his biography as part of his defense.  \u201cIt is apparent that the defendant fully intends at trial to suggest-if not outright argue-that he was a successful lawyer who had no reason to commit a financially-motivated offense,\u201d Podolsky wrote. \u201cThat suggestion would be false.\u201d  Avenatti has denied owing millions in debt.

Still, shares of the company were down about 1.5% in early trade as investors worried about its weak margins and growing competition in North America from Adidas ADSGn.DE, Skechers SKX.N and VF Corp's VFC.N Vans.  In efforts to win market share from rivals, Nike has collaborated with celebrities, launched limited edition sneakers, spent on technology and increased marketing around major sporting events.  The company\u2019s sales have also got a boost in recent years from its \u201cConsumer Direct Offense\u201d strategy that includes focus on online sales, product launches and supply chain improvements to bring new products to shelves faster.  Overall, quarterly sales rose a better-than-expected 10.2%, with its famous Jordan brand hitting $1 billion in sales for the first time. North America sales rose 5%, but came in slightly below expectations.

Adidas has put a big focus on the U.S. market in recent years, teaming up with celebrities such as Kanye West and Pharrell Williams, poaching designers from Nike and pushing retro styles that have proved more popular than Nike\u2019s basketball shoes.  But Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said on Wednesday its suppliers - mostly in Asia - have not been able to keep up, especially as the company has expanded from high-end products into more mid-priced clothing ranges in the U.S. market.  \u201cThe volume grew quicker than anticipated and we didn\u2019t respond quickly enough to that demand signal,\u201d Rorsted told a news conference as Adidas presented 2018 results.  Those supply issues will knock 200 to 400 million euros, or 1-2 percentage points, off currency-neutral group sales growth in 2019, which is likely to slow to between 5 and 8 percent in 2019 from 8 percent in 2018.  In contrast, Nike has forecast sales growth for 2019 approaching low double digits as it rolls out a steady stream of popular new products, and German rival Puma a currency-adjusted 10 percent.  Shares in the German sportswear brand, up 22 percent in the last year, initially fell more than 5 percent but pared loses to trade down 2.2 percent by 1512 GMT.

Rorsted said the shortages had nothing to do with U.S. trade tensions with China.  YEEZY BOOST  The company expects sales growth of just 3-4 percent in the first half of the year, speeding up in the second half as it ramps up supplies by reallocating factory capacity and prioritizing the U.S. market.  Rorsted removed Gil Steyaert as head of the Adidas global supply chain last month after just over a year in the role, and replaced him with Martin Shankland.  \u201cThe overall outlook is very solid for 2019, although top line growth will be rather back-end-loaded and this might be a temporary drag on Adidas shares,\u201d wrote Macquarie analysts.  Currency-neutral sales rose 9 percent in North America in October to December to account for about a quarter of the total, helped by the launch of new \u201cYeezy\u201d shoes designed by Kanye West.  Until recently, Adidas has only produced small quantities of Yeezy sneakers, but it is now increasing production and Rorsted said it expects to launch about 20-30 Yeezy products a year, with the partnership becoming more commercially relevant.  Adidas said it should reach an operating profit margin of between 11.3 percent and 11.5 percent in 2019, up from 10.8 percent in 2018, with the return of the Reebok brand to profit helping it hit a target originally set for 2020 a year early.  Fourth-quarter sales rose by a currency-adjusted 5 percent to 5.234 billion euros ($5.91 billion), ahead of average analyst forecasts for 5.2 billion, while attributable net profit came in at 108 million, versus consensus for 88 million.  Sales rose 13 percent in greater China, but fell 6 percent in Europe, where Nike has been growing fast.  Adidas said it expected to revive growth in Europe in the course of 2019, forecasting a slight increase in currency-neutral revenues for the region.  Rorsted said that Adidas had relied too much in Europe on a short-term trend for fashion shoes, like its retro Stan Smith and Superstar, with global sales of those models down half a billion euros in 2018 from the previous year.  To recover in Europe, he said Adidas is investing heavily in marketing, including with sponsorship deals like the one it struck with English soccer side Arsenal.  \u201cWe want to be the best sports company in the world, not the best fashion company,\u201d Rorsted said.","11":"(Reuters) - Nike Inc NKE.N on Thursday signaled an end to revenue declines in North America as the world's largest footwear maker reaps the benefits of its efforts to sell directly to customers and focus on new launches.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  The company said it expected revenue in North America to be flat in the fourth quarter and return to growth in the first half of fiscal 2019.  Shares of the Dow component rose about 3 percent in extended trading. They had closed down 3 percent at $64.42 in regular trading on reports that William Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square had exited the company with a profit of about $100 million.  \u201cAs we close Q3, we now see a significant reversal of trend in North America,\u201d CEO Mark Parker said in a statement.  North America has been a weak spot for Nike as the company battled tough competition from a resurgent Adidas ADSGn.DE and as the bankruptcies of sporting goods retailers Sports Authority and Sports Chalet weighed on its supply chain.  Revenue in the region has declined for three straight quarters, including a 6 percent drop in the latest quarter.  In response, Nike has pivoted toward selling directly to customers and has partnered with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  Nike is also banking on its strength in innovation.  With more innovation in the Nike Air range, Parker said on a post-earnings call that he expected to grow the business by \u201cseveral billion dollars over the next few years.\u201d  \u201cThe greater scale of these platforms will create greater impact on our business into Q4 and beyond.\u201d  The company\u2019s international business continued to perform well, with all three regions reporting growth in the third quarter.  China sales jumped 24.3 percent and the company plans to maintain the momentum through the launch of NikePlus membership in the Asian country in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  Nike reported a net loss of $921 million, or 57 cents per share in the three months ended Feb. 28, compared with a profit of $1.14 billion, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier.  The company recorded a one-time charge of $2 billion in the reported quarter related to the recently enacted U.S. tax law.  Excluding the charge, the company earned 68 cents per share, beating expectations of 53 cents.

FILE PHOTO: Nike CEO Mark Parker speaks during a launch event in New York, United States March 16, 2016. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Donahoe, who has been on Nike's board since 2014, will join the sneaker maker from cloud computing firm ServiceNow Inc NOW.N, where he was CEO for more than four years. Prior to that, he led online retailer eBay EBAY.O for the seven years through 2015.  Nike\u2019s Parker had said last year he would remain CEO and chairman of the footwear maker beyond 2020, with his remarks coming in the midst of a series of executive departures and probes on workplace complaints.  The move comes days after the world\u2019s biggest footwear maker shut down its Nike Oregon Project training group, following the recent four-year ban of the center\u2019s founder and coach Alberto Salazar by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA).  Nike did not give any reason for Parker\u2019s exit from the top job. In an interview to CNBC, Parker said the change was unrelated to the Oregon Project or any other issues.  Parker joined Nike as one of its first footwear designers in 1979, and held several roles during his tenure at the company before taking charge as its top boss in 2006.  Credited with creating the popular Nike Air sneakers as well as other pioneering products, Parker, in the past few years, oversaw Nike\u2019s shift to selling directly to customers online and its success in international markets, particularly China.  He will become Nike\u2019s executive chairman and continue to lead the board after Donahoe takes over as CEO.  \u201cWe like that (Donahoe) comes from technology and that he comes from the digital space and we like that he is a strategist and a leader ... things that have made Nike positive have been because of those sort of strengths,\u201d Jane Hali & Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez said.  Nike\u2019s digital revenue surged 35% in the last fiscal year, with the company expecting online sales to account for about a third of its business by 2023.  Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said Donahoe\u2019s e-commerce experience could help with Nike\u2019s online push, while Parker could focus more on product development, one of his key strengths.  HITS AND MISSES  During Parker\u2019s tenure, Nike\u2019s stock surged more than nine-folds. They were marginally higher in extended trading on Tuesday.  Over the past year, however, Parker faced a number of speedbumps as he chased his target of $50 billion in annual sales. He apologised to staff last year after a series of workplace complaints at the company.  Nike also came under fire for featuring an ad with former NFL player Colin Kaepernick, who sparked a national controversy by kneeling during the national anthem.  \u201cNike has had their fair share of scandals and issues ... and they didn\u2019t really go out and look externally. It definitely seems like it could be part of\u201d the Oregon scandal, Yarbrough said, referring to Parker\u2019s departure.  Separately, ServiceNow said it appointed Bill McDermott as its CEO. McDermott helmed software maker SAP from 2014 until recently. ServiceNow shares fell about 16% on the news.  McDermott stood down earlier this month after a decade building up SAP SAPG.DE as the world's leading enterprise software company, handing the task of completing its transition to cloud computing to new co-CEOs Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein.  Earlier in the day, Nike rival Under Armour Inc UAA.N said its founder and CEO Kevin Plank would step down, giving his responsibilities to Patrik Frisk, a company insider, hoping a change in leadership will help battle brutal competition from Nike and Adidas in the United States.","15":"Feb 15 (Reuters) - Nike Inc:  * NIKE, INC.

The Washington Post reported that Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would announce a formal impeachment inquiry of Trump, a Republican, later on Tuesday.  Support amongst Democrats for the start of impeachment proceedings increased after news that Trump may have sought foreign help in smearing a political rival.

He said the released transcript would show the call was \u201ctotally appropriate\u201d and that he had not pressured Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and that there had been no quid pro quo for U.S. aid in exchange for a probe.  \u201cWhat all of that combined is going to do is ensure there is going to be elevated volatility in both directions in the next few days,\u201d said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.

The company's focus on its digital platform and launch of sneakers, such as Air Max 270 and Epic React, not only helped it fight off competition from German rivals Adidas ADSGn.DE and Puma, but also deliver on its promise of a significant reversal in its home market.  The Oregon-based company is also gaining on the resurgence of \u201890s fashion trends that is helping boost sales of its classic sneakers. Industry research shows that sneaker sales rose 10 percent globally last year.  Nike shares rose to $79.98 in early trading, adding $13 billion to its market value of about $115 billion. The stock was the top gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI.  Sales at its North America business rose 3.3 percent in the quarter after having fallen for most of the year.  \u201cThe Nike story is officially back at this point and investors will no longer have an opportunity to \u2018wait for a better entry point\u2019 as all signs point to an acceleration,\u201d McClintock said.  Analysts at Credit Suisse said strong results prove that several years of distribution disruption, bloated inventories, lackluster innovation, and market share losses are in the past.  The company also said it expects 2019 revenue to be in the high single-digit range, compared with its earlier forecast of mid-to-high single-digit growth. It also announced a $15 billion buyback program.  \"Nike's business is beginning to inflect in NA, and we expect the company to continue to recapture the share it has lost to Adidas ADSGn.DE,\" Jefferies analysts said in a note titled 'Share Gains Back = ADI-os!'

A working group at governing body World Athletics has been examining for months what to do about the hyper-advanced footwear, used by elite runners Kenya\u2019s Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei in stunning performances last year.  Competing media reports this week have claimed, without giving sources, that it will either issue a wholesale ban on the shoes or take more limited measures to deal with the carbon plate and foam sole technology it uses to aid runners.  Debate has raged among athletes and commentators on Twitter and other social media sites about whether the shoes should be allowed and if a ban could be implemented effectively beyond heavily-monitored elite racing.  The publicity may only benefit Nike\u2019s bottom line.  \u201cControversy is good for sales,\u201d said Matt Powell, senior sports industry adviser at NPD Group.  \u201cNike has not made a lot of pairs here, so (there is) no real financial impact. Amateur runners can still run in these shoes.\u201d  Kipchoge, who wore Vaporflys when he ran the first sub-two-hour marathon in Vienna last October, told the Telegraph on Wednesday that wearing the shoes was \u201cfair\u201d and that the sport should embrace such technological advances.  Nike says on its website that the shoe, which retails at around $250, has \u201ca built-in secret weapon\u201d. It did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.  Shares in the Oregon-based firm were up 0.5%, while those in rivals Under Armour and Skechers USA gained about 1.5%. Japan\u2019s Asics Corp earlier closed up 2.5%.  Independent studies have concluded that the shoes, which have a curved, carbon-fiber plate embedded in a thick layer of lightweight foam, improve metabolic efficiency by 4%, though that does not necessarily mean a runner will be 4% faster.  Nike, which aims to sell $50 billion worth of sportswear this year, capitalized in the 1980s on the controversy around Michael Jordan wearing red and black sneakers which violated the NBA\u2019s \u201cpredominantly white\u201d rules.  Nike put black censor bars over the sneakers in TV ads and later re-launched its Air Jordan 1 shoes in a \u201cbanned\u201d edition.

The NOP was set up mainly to develop U.S. endurance runners but athletes from other countries, including Britain\u2019s Olympic 5,000 and 10,000 meters champion Mo Farah, also trained there.  \"UKA ... commissioned the independent review to review the processes under which the issues concerning the NOP were investigated in 2015 and 2017 and the subsequent related decisions made by the UKA board at those respective times,\" the national governing body said in a statement here.  \u201cThe independent review will also set out any recommendations to assist UKA ensure its future governance and assurance framework is robust.\u201d  The review aims to address questions such as whether the UKA sought advice from UK Sport, UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) and USADA in relation to the issues that came up and whether informed decisions were made based on evidence available at the time.  UKA said in October that its 2015 investigation, which cleared Farah to work with Salazar, was \u201crestricted to the interaction of the Nike Oregon Project with Mo Farah and not an anti-doping investigation\u201d.

Prosecutors in Manhattan accused Avenatti, 48, of stealing about $300,000 from Daniels, the client who made him famous, to fund an extravagant lifestyle including a Ferrari automobile, after helping her secure a book contract.  The Nike indictment concerns charges announced in March that Avenatti tried to extort more than $20 million from the athletic wear company by threatening to expose what he called its improper payments to recruits for college basketball teams it sponsored.  Avenatti also faces dozens of charges in southern California, where prosecutors on April 11 accused him of stealing millions of dollars from clients to pay for personal and business expenses, and lying to the Internal Revenue Service and a Mississippi bank about his finances.  If convicted on all charges, Avenatti could face more than 400 years in prison, but would likely face a lesser punishment.  Nike has denied wrongdoing, and assisted prosecutors prior to Avenatti\u2019s arrest.

Daniels is identified in court papers as \u201cVictim-1.\u201d A person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly confirmed her identity.  According to the papers, Avenatti spent some of the diverted funds on lease payments for the Ferrari, hotels, airfare, restaurant meals, car service and business expenses.  Prosecutors said Avenatti eventually paid $148,750 to Daniels after obtaining the money from another source, but lied when she asked where the second payment was by telling her the publisher \u201cowes me a payment\u201d and that he was \u201con it.\u201d  Daniels has not received that payment, prosecutors said. She dropped Avenatti as her lawyer earlier this year.  \u201cMichael Avenatti abused and violated the core duty of an attorney--the duty to his client,\u201d U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, who announced Wednesday\u2019s indictments, said in a statement.  \u201cFar from zealously representing his client, Avenatti, as alleged, instead engaged in outright deception and theft, victimizing rather than advocating for his client,\u201d Berman added.  The charges related to Daniels include one count of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft, and carry a maximum combined penalty of 22 years in prison.  Daniels\u2019 book \u201cFull Disclosure\u201d was published in October.  Cohen is two weeks into his three-year prison term after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, including the hush money payment.  Avenatti became a familiar face on cable news channels as his stature grew, and flirted last year with a 2020 White House run. He has had a lower profile since being charged.","25":"(Reuters) - Nike Inc, Lululemon Athletica Inc and Under Armour Inc on Sunday said they would close stores in the United States and other markets, joining a growing list of major retailers moving to help limit the spread of the coronavirus.  The virus, which began in China at the end of last year, has led to school closures and canceled sports events in the United States and beyond. It is widely expected to hit retail sales as shoppers stay home to avoid catching the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that the virus causes.  The United States\u2019 top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said conditions would likely get worse before they get better.

In its attempt to gain market share over rivals, Nike has collaborated with celebrities, ramped up sneaker launches and increased marketing around major sporting events.

Prosecutors accused Avenatti, 48, of stealing about $300,000 from Daniels, about half of which has not been repaid, after helping his former client secure a book contract.  They also said he has been indicted on previously announced charges that he tried to blackmail Nike out of more than $20 million by threatening to expose what he called the athletic wear company\u2019s improper payments to recruits for college basketball teams it sponsored.  The charges were announced by U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan.  Avenatti also faces dozens of charges in California, where prosecutors on April 11 accused him of stealing millions of dollars from clients to pay for personal and business expenses, and lying to the Internal Revenue Service and a Mississippi bank about his finances.  If convicted on all charges, Avenatti could face several hundred years in prison.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Williamson, the reigning college basketball player of the year, dominated in his only season at Duke University, breaking several school records, including most 25-point games by a freshman.  The New Orleans Pelicans signed Williamson after picking him first overall in the National Basketball Association draft.  Williamson, who has drawn comparisons to former NBA great and Hall of Famer Charles Barkley, is known for his athleticism.  With his uncommon blend of leaping ability and wide, muscular build, Williamson churned out a string of highlight plays in his lone season at Duke, including 360-degree slam dunks, towering rebounds and stunning blocked shots.  Terms of the deal were not disclosed by Nike. Its shares rose 1% to $86.81.  The 6-foot-7-inch (2 meters), 285-pound (129.3 kg) forward was involved in a social media storm earlier this year after a Nike sneaker he was wearing split during a game causing him to suffer a mild knee sprain. Nike apologized for the malfunction.  Former U.S. President Barack Obama was in attendance at that game in February against Duke rival University of North Carolina and later wished Williamson a speedy recovery in a tweet.  Willamson\u2019s signing with Nike comes as no surprise given the loyalty and reputation the company has in the basketball community, Jane Hali & Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez said.  \u201cHis signing with Jordan just proves how important the brand is becoming for Nike as they continue to revive it,\u201d she added.

The ad as well as Nike\u2019s efforts to woo younger customers with its new Jordan and React sneakers and its World Cup jerseys had taken expectations to a fever pitch, with most investors and analysts hoping for a raise in its outlook.

Shares of Nike, which have risen 35 percent this year, were down about $2 at $82.51 in premarket trading.  The company said on an earnings call on Tuesday the ad campaign, which included the Kaepernick ad and was meant to mark the 30th anniversary of its \u201cJust Do It\u201d slogan, was driving an uptick in traffic and \u201crecord\u201d customer engagement.  The ad revived a raging debate in the United States that started in 2016 when Kaepernick, then with the San Francisco 49ers, began kneeling to protest multiple police shootings of unarmed black men.  Many protestors burned Nike shoes and called for a boycott of its products. Nike stock fell 3.2 percent, the day after the ad was launched.  In the weeks that followed, several analysts and marketing experts said they expected the new ad to create increased interest in the brand and bump sales.  Nike said it expects full-year revenue to rise in the in the lower end of a high single-digit range due to a stronger dollar.  For the first quarter, the Beaverton, Oregon-based company reported a 10 percent rise in revenue, beating analysts\u2019 estimates. Its profit also came in above estimates despite higher commodity costs dampening margins.  Post earnings, Wall Street remained bullish with at least five analysts raising their price targets on the stock, with Morgan Stanley lifting it to a street high of $103. The median price target on the stock is $87.  \u201cWe advocate buying the dip as its margin expansion story remains in early innings,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note to clients. \u201cNKE remains our top pick.\u201d  The company\u2019s strong fundamentals, market share gains in North America and exciting new products has kept Wall Street bullish, with 22 of 37 analysts rating its stock \u201cbuy\u201d or higher.  In efforts to take back more market share from rival Adidas AG and newcomer Under Armour Inc, Nike has pushed hard with a slew of new product launches and a renewed focus on its digital platform.  \u201cThe underlying fundamentals or the building blocks of the story are still intact,\u201d Svezia said.

FILE PHOTO: Attorney Michael Avenatti exits the United States Courthouse in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 8, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  U.S. District Judge James Selna remanded Avenatti to federal custody at a hearing in Santa Ana, California, where prosecutors had charged him last March with stealing millions of dollars from clients, defrauding a bank and lying to the Internal Revenue Service and a bankruptcy court.  Prosecutors said Avenatti concealed $1 million he received last April, in a client settlement, from his second ex-wife and other creditors to whom he owed more than $11 million, spending some on a Mercedes-Benz.  Avenatti is awaiting trial on three federal indictments, and has pleaded not guilty on all charges.  In the Nike case, Avenatti was charged in Manhattan with threatening to publicly accuse the sportswear company of improperly paying families of college basketball recruits unless it paid him up to $25 million to conduct a probe plus $1.5 million to his client, a youth basketball coach.  U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe, who oversees the Nike case, said Avenatti\u2019s arrest caused an \u201cenormous disruption\u201d requiring an adjournment of the Jan. 21 trial, which Avenatti will be allowed to attend. Gardephe said he would be \u201cvery reluctant\u201d to delay it past Jan. 27.  Jose Quinon, a lawyer for Avenatti, sought a longer delay, saying that because the new accusations involved money his client controlled, they undermined Avenatti\u2019s ability even to pay for witnesses.  \u201cThe rug has been pulled from under us because this was absolutely, totally unexpected,\u201d Quinon said. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to war without weapons.\u201d  Gardephe urged both sides to work out their differences. \u201cI\u2019m asking that people be practical here, given the hand we have been dealt, which is a bad one,\u201d he said.  Avenatti became famous as a self-described Trump nemesis and for representing porn actress Stormy Daniels, who received hush money before the 2016 election not to reveal an alleged sexual encounter with Trump, which the president denies.  Earlier Wednesday, Gardephe refused to dismiss the Nike prosecution, which Avenatti called \u201cvindictive\u201d and payback for his animosity toward Trump.  The judge found no evidence of malice, and noted that it was Nike that alerted prosecutors to the alleged extortion.  \u201cAvenatti is being prosecuted for activities wholly unrelated to the political arena,\u201d Gardephe wrote.  Before his Tuesday arrest, Avenatti faced a possible 335 years in prison in the California case.  He was also charged in Manhattan with stealing nearly $300,000 of Daniels\u2019 proceeds from her book contract.","41":"March 15 (Reuters) - Nike Inc is closing all of its stores in the United States and several other countries in a move to curb the spread of coronavirus, CNBC reported here on Sunday.

Shares in the German sportswear maker, which have risen by a quarter this year, jumped 7 percent to a new record high, with the sector also buoyed by Under Armour Inc raising its full-year earnings forecast on Thursday.  The group\u2019s profitability has long lagged that of bigger rival Nike, but has improved under Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted, who has focused on expanding in North America and Asia and pushing online sales, where margins are higher than wholesale.  In the first quarter, Adidas said its operating margin rose 1.4 percentage points to 14.9 percent, pulling ahead of Nike which recorded an operating margin of 13.5 percent for the December to February period.  \u201cEarnings are much better than guided for the full year \u2013 leaving the door open for margin guidance upgrades in the course of the year 2019,\u201d said Baader Helvea analyst Volker Bosse, who rates the stock \u201chold\u201d.  Adidas is chipping away at Nike\u2019s dominance of the U.S. market, pushing retro styles that have proved more popular than Nike\u2019s basketball shoes, and teaming up with celebrities such as Kanye West, whose Yeezy line has driven recent strong growth.  Adidas announced last month it is partnering with singer Beyonce, which Rorsted said on Friday would have a \u201ctremendous impact\u201d, noting that the deal generated 1 billion online views, with the first products due for launch later in 2019.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  ONLINE BOOM  First-quarter profitability was helped by lower sourcing and marketing costs, favorable currency developments as well as selling more higher priced products and the expansion of online, with ecommerce sales up 40 percent in the quarter.  Rorsted told journalists ecommerce had grown fast in all regions, helped by exclusive launches of new products and the fact the Adidas app has been downloaded 9 million times. He expects online growth to continue at 30-40 percent for years.  Overall, sales growth slowed in the first quarter to a currency-adjusted 4 percent rise to 5.883 billion euros ($6.57 billion), but was still ahead of analyst consensus.  Adidas had already warned in March that supply chain issues would hit sales growth in the first half, citing particular problems meeting North America demand for mid-market clothing.  Adidas said it was working to mitigate the shortages, including using more air freight to ship goods - implying higher logistics costs in the second and third quarters - but Rorsted said the problems should ease by the end of the year.  He also expects a recovery by then in Europe - where revenue fell 3 percent in the first quarter, as Adidas seeks to reduce its reliance on its Originals fashion line and boost sales of sports performance gear, with new product launches.  Sales of soccer jerseys ahead of the 2020 European soccer championship should have their first positive impact in the fourth quarter, Rorsted added.","43":"AMSTERDAM, March 2 (Reuters) - Nike\u2019s will close its European headquarters in the Netherlands on Monday and Tuesday after an employee was infected with the coronavirus, Dutch news agency ANP said.

FILE PHOTO: Nike shoes are seen on display in New York, U.S., March 18, 2019. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/  Shares rose 13% and are set to open on Wednesday at an all-time high of about $132.  Nike\u2019s brick-and-mortar sales have fallen since the COVID-19 pandemic began, as malls and department stores were shuttered around the world. To combat that, the footwear maker has turned its focus to direct-to-consumer sales, especially through its own website and apps.  The brand\u2019s digital sales surged 82% in the first quarter ended Aug. 31, with at least double-digit rises recorded in all regions. In the prior quarter, Nike reported a 75% increase in online sales - nearly a third of total revenue, a goal Nike had previously set for 2023.  \u201cWe know that digital is the new normal. The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back,\u201d Nike Chief Executive John Donahoe said.  Nike said it expected fiscal full-year revenue to rise between high single digits and low double digits versus last year, saying second-half sales would be \u201cup significantly,\u201d even though first-half growth would be flat. Analysts forecast a fiscal 2021 sales rise of 5.9%, according to Refinitiv IBES.  U.S. retailers including Foot Locker Inc and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc - which canceled shipments in the early days of the pandemic - have begun making orders for inventory in the second half of Nike\u2019s fiscal year, analysts say.  Earnings before interest and taxes rose 18% in North America, Nike\u2019s biggest market, with footwear sales up 11% to nearly $3 billion.  \u201cGreat quarter, guidance was better than expected, the stock is priced to perfection,\u201d said Nate Fischer, chief investment strategist at Strategic Wealth Partners, which does not own Nike shares but has the stock on its watchlist. He warned, however, that the stock would be sold off if it misses any quarters coming up.  Tuesday\u2019s results are a far cry from those of just a quarter ago, when Nike reported a surprise loss of $790 million as retailers canceled orders and people kept away from Nike stores in key markets like North America, Europe and China.  Shares in the Portland, Oregon-based company have risen 16% this year. Nike has gained favor among shoppers this year with investments in marketing itself as a socially conscious company, prominently supporting movements like Black Lives Matter and Time to Vote.  First-quarter sales in China, where the economy opened from lockdowns much earlier than in other parts of the world, rose 6%, led by factory stores and online sales.  The company\u2019s net income rose to $1.52 billion, or 95 cents per share, from $1.37 billion, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier.","46":"(Reuters) - Shares of yoga-pants specialists Lululemon Athletica Inc rose 15 percent on Thursday, with several Wall Street analysts raising their price targets for the company after a blockbuster fourth quarter.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Wednesday\u2019s results showed the Vancouver-based athleisure wear maker moving strongly into menswear, improving online sales and potentially challenging bigger rival Nike Inc on its home turf.  Lululemon forecast a strong 2019, said North America was doing well and reported a 37 percent jump in direct-to-consumer net revenue for the three months ended Feb. 3.  The company is reaping the benefits from heavy investments in boosting its online presence, opening more stores and refreshing its clothing line.  Online sales in China were particularly robust, rising more than 140 percent in the quarter, Chief Operating Officer Stuart Haselden said on a post-earnings conference call.  \u201cLulu captured the women\u2019s market, that\u2019s where they started with yogawear being their staple. Now they\u2019ve evolved some of that collection into everyday-wear and that\u2019s been really successful for them,\u201d Jane Hali & Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez said.  Design oriented and fashion forward apparel also allow Lululemon to charge premium prices, Ramirez said.  Its success in North America, which contributes close to 90 percent of its business, stood out in a quarter where Nike, which introduced yogawear at the end of last year, fell short of Wall Street estimates for U.S. sales the first time in a year.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of runway for us to continue to grow our men\u2019s business,\u201d Chief Operating Officer Stuart Haselden said in a post earnings conference call with analysts.  \u201cWe really believe that Lululemon can be a dual-gender brand, and that our men\u2019s business can ultimately be as big as our women\u2019s.\u201d  Allen Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy firm Metaforce, said that Lululemon\u2019s expansion into menswear and fitness will add to headaches for Nike and Adidas, already in a brutal war over market share in their core markets.  \u201cThey play in the same neighborhood but not on the same block,\u201d he said. \u201cLululemon has one foot in the fashion world and one foot in athletics while Nike has both feet in athletics.\u201d  Adamson said Lululemon could pose more of a threat to Nike in newer markets like China where consumers\u2019 definitions of the circumstances in which they can wear fitness, athletics and sports clothing are shifting quickly.  At least 11 brokerages have raised their price targets on Lululemon\u2019s stock, with Stifel raising it the most by $35 to $187. JP Morgan held the highest target price of $197.  \u201cWe expect Lululemon to continue to rise above others who sell active wear, through targeted and nuanced customer engagement both online and in stores,\u201d Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser said.

The company has launched timed, limited-edition sales on its app, often in collaboration with celebrities and athletes, called \u201cdrops,\u201d generating hype around its brands, especially with its Jordan line of basketball shoes.  Nike has also introduced sneakers such as the Air Max 720 and Epic React Flyknit 2 to capture market share in the United States.  The efforts, however, fell short of analysts\u2019 elevated expectations. North America sales rose 7 percent to $3.81 billion in the third quarter, falling short of estimates of $3.87 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cWhile it\u2019s not very clear what caused the domestic weakness, it\u2019s possible that the news of what happened with the Duke University player\u2019s shoe had a short-term negative impact,\u201d said Kian Salehizadeh, a senior analyst at investment firm Blockforce Capital.  College basketball superstar Zion Williamson sprained his knee in February after his Nike sneaker split during a game, prompting an outcry on social media.  Salehizadeh, whose firm owns shares in Nike through ETFs, said overall retail weakness in the United States over the last few months could also have hit sales.  Nike Chief Financial Officer Andrew Campion highlighted timing of launches of some NBA apparel products last year on a post-earnings call. A decline at the Converse brand also weighed.  \u201cConverse is losing out to brands like Vans, while Nike seems to be focusing more on the growth of its Jordan business,\u201d Jane Hali & Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez told Reuters.  Nike said it expects low single-digit reported revenue growth in the current quarter, compared to analysts\u2019 estimates of a 6.1 percent rise.  This comes as analysts have said Nike is likely to gain after German rival Adidas warned that supply chain issues would curb sales growth in the first half of the year, particularly in North America.

But the 36-year-old\u2019s decision to switch to Nike\u2019s Vaporfly trainers before securing her new personal best (PB) time has her wondering whether she cheated herself, or dirtied a sport she\u2019s always loved for its purity.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re running you just want to run for yourself,\u201d Grundon told Reuters during a lunchtime run at her local park. \u201cIt\u2019s just you against the road and the time that you have in mind to beat.  \u201cSo, investing in a pair of trainers that are meant to make you automatically faster - well, there were ethical considerations, and whether it could be cheating, I suppose.\u201d  Scientific studies as well as anecdotal evidence suggest that Nike\u2019s Vaporfly running shoes, equipped with super-springy foam soles encasing a carbon-fibre plate, can increase running efficiency by between 4% and 6%.

She described how she\u2019d been chasing the 1:30 half marathon time for a few years, and \u201cinching closer and closer to it\u201d.  When she entered the Madrid half marathon she decided it was going to be her last shot at a PB for a while before taking a training break. She opted to buy Nike\u2019s Vaporfly shoes after seeing other fast runners wearing them and reading reviews.  \u201cThey feel very strange to walk in, but as soon as you\u2019re racing and you\u2019re running, they really do feel fast,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cI smashed my target actually quite considerably.  \u201cBut even after the event, that made me wonder whether I should have worn them - because I think I probably could have beaten my target just in my ordinary trainer.\u201d (Additional reporting by Stuart McDill and Nivedita Balu; Editing by Mike Collet-White)","49":"(Reuters) - British distance runner Jo Pavey has become the latest female athlete to complain that Nike halted her sponsorship payments when she was pregnant, Sky News reported on Thursday.

Traditional U.S. retailers have been facing relentless pressure from a shift to online retailers like Amazon.com AMZN.O and a resulting drop in traffic at malls. For Foot Locker, a tie-up between the e-commerce giant and Nike launched last year has only added to those pressures.  Industry research, however, shows sneaker sales, crucial to Foot Locker\u2019s bottom line, rose 10 percent globally last year and a dog fight between Nike and Adidas has also seen the big brands spending heavily on U.S. sales and marketing.

Nike has denied wrongdoing.  \u201cWhen the actual evidence is heard at trial rather than the baseless allegations in the indictment, I will be fully cleared because I did nothing wrong,\u201d Avenatti, 48, said in a text message. \u201cI am innocent.\u201d  A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan declined to comment.  Known for representing porn star Stormy Daniels and criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump, Avenatti faces a Jan. 21 trial over his dealings with Nike, and two criminal trials this spring on unrelated charges. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.  Prosecutors accused Avenatti of telling Nike last March he would not publicize his client Gary Franklin\u2019s claims about the payments if the sportswear company would pay Franklin $1.5 million, and him up to $25 million to conduct an internal probe.  They said Avenatti also failed to tell Franklin, who coached a youth basketball team in a Nike-sponsored league, that Nike offered to settle the coach\u2019s claims without paying Avenatti, and instead used those claims to secure riches for himself.  Prosecutors said this fraudulently deprived Franklin of Avenatti\u2019s \u201chonest services.\u201d  Avenatti said the charge should have been thrown out because it did not mention a \u201cbribe\u201d or \u201ckickback,\u201d which he said was necessary under a 2010 Supreme Court case involving former Enron Corp Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling.  Gardephe, however, said the absence of those words had no \u201ctalismanic significance,\u201d and it was enough for the government to accuse Avenatti of violating a \u201cknown legal duty\u201d to Franklin even if Nike never paid Avenatti a cent.  \u201cThe indictment pleads facts sufficient to demonstrate that Avenatti violated the legally cognizable duties a lawyer owes to his client,\u201d Gardephe wrote.

At least 14 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets following Nike\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly results, with Susquehanna the most bullish, raising its target by $14.  \u201cNike delivered the closest thing to a complete game for a public company,\u201d said Barclays analyst Matthew McClintock, who boosted his target to $85 from $80.  The company\u2019s focus on its digital platform and launch of sneakers, such as Air Max 270 and Epic React, not only helped it fight off competition from German rivals Adidas and Puma, but also deliver on its promise of a significant reversal in its home market.  The Oregon-based company is also gaining on the resurgence of \u201890s fashion trends that is helping boost sales of its classic sneakers. Industry research shows that sneaker sales rose 10 percent globally last year.  Sales at its North America business rose 3.3 percent in the quarter after having fallen for most of the year.  \u201cThe Nike story is officially back at this point and investors will no longer have an opportunity to \u2018wait for a better entry point\u2019 as all signs point to an acceleration,\u201d McClintock said.

It will report Reebok as a discontinued operation from the first quarter of 2021.  A banking source said the business could be worth around 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion).  \u201cReebok and Adidas will be able to significantly better realize their growth potential independently of each other,\u201d Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said in a statement .  The company bought Boston-based Reebok for $3.8 billion in 2006, but its sluggish performance led to repeated calls from investors to dispose of the brand.  In the meantime, Adidas managed to eat into Nike\u2019s dominance in the United States with its core brand, helped by partnership with celebrities like Kanye West, Beyonce and Pharrell Williams.  After Rorsted took over as CEO in 2016, he launched a turnaround plan for Reebok, which helped it return to profitability, but its performance continued to lag that of the core Adidas brand and it was then hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Reebok\u2019s net sales fell 7% in the third quarter of 2020 to 403 million euros ($488 million), after falling as much as 44% the preceding quarter. In 2019, Adidas wrote down Reebok\u2019s book value by nearly half, compared with 2018, to 842 million euros.  Options for Adidas include spinning Reebok off as a stand-alone public company, or selling the brand to private equity, another major sports retailer or a multibrand player like VF Corp.  Reebok\u2019s recent collaborations with celebrities like Cardi B and a refreshed focus on women\u2019s apparel have put the brand in a better place, analysts say.  Adidas said in November it was expecting a drop in overall sales for the end of 2020 as the reimposition of lockdowns in Europe offset a return to growth in China and strong demand for running gear and products designed by Beyonce.

Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, said Nike\u2019s move was a \u201cterrible decision.\u201d  Nike recalled the shoe after former NFL quarterback and Nike pitchman Colin Kaepernick asked the company not to sell a shoe with a symbol that he and others consider offensive because of its connection to an era of slavery, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.  Nike had planned to release a new version of the Air Max 1 sneaker ahead of the Fourth of July holiday that featured a version of the U.S. flag with 13 white stars representing the first U.S. colonies. The flag is commonly known as the \u201cBetsy Ross flag.\u201d  \u201cWords cannot express my disappointment at this terrible decision. I am embarrassed for Nike,\u201d Ducey said in a series of tweets on the recall.  \u201cInstead of celebrating American history the week of our nation\u2019s independence, Nike has apparently decided that Betsy Ross is unworthy, and has bowed to the current onslaught of political correctness and historical revisionism,\u201d he said.

In December, Prada pulled products accused of depicting blackface.

Ducey, who was joined by many conservatives including Republican Senator Ted Cruz in expressing his disappointment toward Nike, said he had ordered the state\u2019s commerce authority to withdraw all financial incentives under its discretion for the company\u2019s plant.  Nike was eligible for up to a $1 million grant, a spokeswoman at the Arizona Commerce Authority said, for a $185 million plant in Goodyear, Arizona, that would employ over 500 people.  Kaepernick last year became the face of Nike\u2019s advertisement marking the 30th anniversary of the company\u2019s \u201cJust Do It\u201d slogan.  The ad revived a raging debate in the United States that started in 2016 when Kaepernick, then with the San Francisco 49ers, began kneeling to protest multiple police shootings of unarmed black men.

Gardephe also called it premature to dismiss as vague the two counts, alleging extortion and transmitting interstate communications with intent to extort.  Avenatti is also charged with honest services wire fraud against his client, youth basketball coach Gary Franklin, by concealing how Nike had offered to settle so long as it did not have to hire and pay Avenatti to probe the alleged payments.  Lawyers for Avenatti did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan declined to comment.  Avenatti, 48, became famous representing porn star Stormy Daniels and becoming an antagonist of U.S. President Donald Trump.  He faces a scheduled Jan. 21 trial after pleading not guilty to illegally demanding up to $25 million from Nike last March in exchange for not publicizing the basketball payments, and being hired for the internal probe. Nike has denied wrongdoing.  In letting the case proceed, Gardephe cited the 1997 conviction of Autumn Jackson for trying to extort $40 million from Cosby in exchange for not revealing she was his illegitimate child.  Cosby disputed that claim, but admitted to having an affair with Jackson\u2019s mother, and had quietly made payments to help her and put Jackson through college.  Jackson was sentenced to 26 months in prison. Cosby is serving a three- to 10-year prison sentence following his 2018 sexual assault conviction.  Gardephe said conduct becomes wrongful when people to threaten economic loss or reputational harm to obtain property to which they are not entitled.  Prosecutors alleged that money Avenatti sought for himself was separate from the $1.5 million he sought for Franklin.  \u201cWhile Avenatti\u2019s client may have been in a position to make demands to Nike, Avenatti had no right - independent of his client - to demand millions of dollars from Nike based on confidential information supplied by his client; without his client\u2019s knowledge; and to his client\u2019s detriment,\u201d Gardephe said.  Avenatti has also pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in Manhattan that he cheated Daniels out of proceeds from a book contract, and in California that he defrauded clients out of millions of dollars.

That has persuaded millions of amateur athletes to ditch their old favorites and give them a go.

When she entered the Madrid half marathon she decided it was going to be her last shot at a PB for a while before taking a training break.

In the fiscal fourth quarter, Nike reported a 75% rise in online sales and Wall Street analysts expect this to continue - at least nine have raised their price targets on the stock in the last two weeks.  In the first quarter, 12% of all footwear on Nike.com featured new types of sneakers and shoes, versus 10% in the prior quarter, according to apparel data firm StyleSage. The company sold out 17% of all footwear this year, compared with 6% in the fourth quarter, showing improvements in customer demand and investment in new items online. Online sales for Nike clothing show a similar trend.  E-commerce sales are now nearly a third of Nike\u2019s total revenue \u2013 a goal Nike had previously set for 2023. Nike\u2019s first-quarter adjusted sales in China are also expected to have grown by more than 10% as official lockdowns there all but ended.  Particularly in North America, sales in the global athletic footwear and apparel industry have picked up, and Nike will get a boost from the new back-to-school dynamic, said Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia.

To save costs and target investment online this year, the company said in July it would cut corporate jobs starting Oct. 1 and end nine major retail contracts, including deals with department store Dillard's and Amazon.com-owned AMZN.O shoe retailer Zappos. Nike in July scrapped plans to open a major shoe plant in Arizona in favor of investments elsewhere.  The company has invested this year in marketing itself as a supporter of high-profile social and political movements like Black Lives Matter and Time to Vote, and launched a new maternity line and several inclusive ad campaigns.","73":"FILE PHOTO: Signage is seen at a Superdry store in London, Britain, March 1, 2019.

Dunkerton, Superdry\u2019s biggest shareholder with a 20.3% stake, rejoined the company\u2019s board in April last year after narrowly winning a shareholder vote, prompting the existing directors, including then CEO Euan Sutherland, to resign en masse.

Bonello, who will join the company in March, spent 18 years at Nike and was most recently the VP of operations for Vans EMEA.  The company also said Chairman Peter Williams would be stepping down next year, after less than two years in the role, once a successor is appointed.  His exit comes after the departure of Chief Financial Officer Nick Gresham, who stepped down in October, after only 16 months in the role.  \u201cWith the search for a new CFO well advanced, the completed executive team will be in place early next year and so 2021 is an appropriate time for me to step down,\u201d Williams said.

REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Nike Inc NKE.N, the world's largest sportswear maker, is exploring options for its surfwear brand Hurley International, including its possible divestment, according to people familiar with the matter.  Nike\u2019s potential retrenchment from the surfwear market is emblematic of the stance of most major consumer companies towards the sector. Surf brands have lost their appeal among non-surfing consumers, who now prefer boutique brands and retro streetwear.  Among the options that Nike is considering for Hurley is an outright sale of the Costa Mesa, California-born brand, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the deliberations are confidential.  It is not clear how much Nike could fetch by selling Hurley. Nike declined to comment.  Nike purchased Hurley from founder Bob Hurley in 2002 for an undisclosed sum in an effort to expand beyond athletic-focused apparel and into other sportswear for surfing, skating, and snowboarding.  Bob Hurley founded the company in 1979 and achieved notoriety in the 1970s for shaping the surf board for world champion Wayne \u201cRabbit\u201d Bartholomew.  In the last few years, the burgeoning appetite for clothing associated with the beach lifestyle and culture waned, to the point that former global leader Quiksilver filed for bankruptcy in 2015 before being taken over by private equity firm Oaktree Capital Management OAK.N.  Mainstream fashion has dropped surfwear in favor of athleisure, while emerging fashion is turning toward urban streetwear brands like Carlyle-backed Supreme, and throwback looks like the revived sportswear brand Fila and Champion.  Last year, Boardriders Inc, the company behind Quiksilver, Roxy and DC Shoes that is owned by Oaktree, acquired its struggling Australian rival Billabong, owner of its namesake brand along with other lifestyle brands such as Element and VonZipper.","75":"BERLIN, Nov 17 (Reuters) - German sportswear firm Puma announced on Tuesday that it has signed a collaboration with British singer Dua Lipa.

Avenatti declined to comment after the hearing.  Prosecutors have accused Avenatti, 48, of demanding money from Nike in exchange for agreeing to scrap a threatened news conference to discuss the athletic wear company\u2019s alleged improper payments to elite college basketball recruits.  A trial is scheduled for Jan. 21, 2020, and could last the rest of January. Nike has denied wrongdoing.  Since his March 25 arrest in the Nike case, Avenatti has defended himself against a variety of criminal charges.  Avenatti has pleaded not guilty in Manhattan to stealing about $300,000 from Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, after helping her secure a book contract.  He has also pleaded not guilty in California to wire fraud, bank fraud and other crimes, including stealing from clients.  The amended Nike indictment dropped two conspiracy counts but added a charge of honest services fraud.  Prosecutors said Avenatti failed to reveal that Nike had offered to settle with his client, youth basketball coach Gary Franklin, so long as the Beaverton, Oregon-based company did not have to pay Avenatti himself.  At Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Avenatti\u2019s lawyer, Scott Srebnick, said that charge should be dismissed, citing a 2010 Supreme Court decision involving former Enron Corp Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling limiting the claim to bribery and kickback cases.  \u201cThe government\u2019s whole theory was that Avenatti was shaking down Nike,\u201d but its case has \u201cmorphed\u201d into alleged bribery solicitation, Srebnick said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know from this indictment exactly what this bribery scheme was.\u201d  Gardephe did not rule on the motion.  The judge also said he was \u201cinclined\u201d to let an expert witness testify for the prosecution about legal ethics rules, though not whether Avenatti violated them.  Prospective jurors are expected to receive questionnaires in advance about the case.  \u201cGiven how much press there has been about Mr. Avenatti, it seems obvious to me that a questionnaire is necessary,\u201d he said.

The first-ever shoe ban by World Athletics (WA) last week addressed concerns that technology advances are giving athletes an unfair and unnatural advantage, described by some critics as \u201ctechnological doping\u201d.  New rules state road shoes must have soles no thicker than 40mm and not contain more than one rigid, embedded carbon fibre plate, and limit the use of some track spikes on the Vaporfly models, but permit the continued use of most of the range.  Nike has now duly launched the latest incarnation of the shoe - the Air Zoom Alphafly Next% - with one carbon plate and a sole thickness of 39.5mm, as well as newly added air pockets.  \u201cWe are pleased the Nike Zoom Vaporfly series and Nike Zoom Alphafly NEXT% remain legal,\u201d said the U.S company. \u201cWe will continue our dialogue with World Athletics and the industry on new standards.\u201d  The Vaporfly controversy has ignited a wider sporting debate: where should the line be drawn between advances in sports technology and equipment giving competitors an unfair advantage, be it running shoes, soccer boots or tennis rackets?  Nike has always said it operates within the rules, while exploring the possibilities provided by new technology. Its Vaporfly shoes have led to a slew of world records since their introduction in 2016 but WA ruled last week that most of the versions used for those records, and by thousands of amateur runners, would remain legal.  Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge used a version of the Vaporfly now deemed illegal for his unofficial sub-two hour marathon in October, a model reportedly with extra-thick soles and three carbon plates. He is expected to use the Alphafly in his London marathon showdown with Ethiopian rival Kenenisa Bekele in April\u2019s London Marathon.  After launching the new shoe on Wednesday, Nike CEO John Donahoe said it did not give athletes a \u201cmechanical advantage\u201d.  \u201cIt\u2019s simply using the same materials that go into a shoe and putting them together in an innovative way that allows the athlete to do their very best in a safe way,\u201d Donahoe said in an interview with CNBC.  A Wall Street Journal report said limited numbers of the new Alphafly shoes will be made available to the public online this month, thereby meeting one of WA\u2019s eligibility requirements for the shoe to be used at this year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics.","82":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Nike is seen in a storefront in Sao Paulo, Brazil, May 28, 2015.

Nike reported a 6 percent drop in sales in North America in the quarter to Feb. 28, while Under Armour saw flat sales in the region in the first three months of the year.  Adidas said ecommerce sales growth slowed to 27 percent, which Rorsted said was due to fewer product launches in the quarter.  Net profit rose 17 percent to 542 million euros ($650 million), ahead analysts average forecast of 510 million euros as higher prices helped offset currency headwinds and an increase in marketing spending.  Rorsted also highlighted gross margin improvements at struggling fitness brand Reebok, which saw sales return to growth in North America for the first time in years.

This follows the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to keep raising interest rates on Wednesday, which was an added headache for investors already fearful that trade wars and other geopolitical concerns would grind economic and corporate growth to a halt.  Now all eyes will be on the November consumer spending, which is expected to have slowed from the month before. But the data, due at 10 a.m. ET, is also expected to show that the core PCE index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, edged higher.  Sentiment was weak earlier as investors also fretted over political turmoil in Washington.  There is a chance that the government could be shut down unless President Donald Trump and Congress cut a funding deal, while adding to the air of crisis was the abrupt resignation of U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis after falling out with Trump over his foreign policies.  Volatility may rise again on Friday on account of \u201cquadruple witching\u201d, as investors unwind interests in futures and options contracts prior to expiration.  \u201cFears of a government shutdown, Mattis resigning, all those things I think are weighing on the sentiment. The attitude was already pretty bad and they (news from Washington) are certainly not helping,\u201d said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.  One silver lining was Nike Inc, whose shares jumped 9.1 percent in premarket trading after the company\u2019s quarterly results beat Wall Street estimates on strength in North America.  At 9:07 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 18 points, or 0.08 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 0.75 points, or 0.03 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 10.75 points, or 0.17 percent.  The three main Wall Street indexes are already in correction territory, having fallen more than 10 percent from their record closing highs, and are closing in on bear market territory, when a security closes 20 percent below a recent high.  While the Nasdaq came within a whisker of bear market territory on Thursday, other segments of the market, including the Russell 2000 small-cap benchmark and the Dow Jones Transport Average are already in bear market territory.","93":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Jeweller Pandora has recruited Geena Tok from Nike to head its business in China, where the Danish company has been challenged by a rise in sales on the grey market.  Pandora has 200 stores and employs more than 1,400 people in China but has said it needs to counter China\u2019s grey market, where increasing numbers of jewelry pieces are imported from other markets and sold online.  Last month Pandora, the world\u2019s largest jewelry maker by production volume, said it would lower retail prices in the country by an average of 15 percent.  Chinese resident Tok joins Pandora next month, having spent 17 years with Nike in the United States, Thailand, India and now in China, where she is leading the sports retailer\u2019s stores and e-commerce business.  Tok will replace Anthony Asinas, who taking up a new role as Pandora\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau chief.  Pandora, best known for its charm bracelets, warned in May of a surprise slowdown in China, which accounts for about 12 percent of its total sales.  China is a key growth market for affordable luxury jewelry makers such as Pandora, with the country\u2019s growing middle class willing to spend at a time when mall shopping in other big markets such as the United States and Britain is declining.","94":"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Major global brands Nike, H&M, Burberry and Gap have signed up to an initiative that aims to improve the industry\u2019s record on sustainability after a study found less than one percent of clothing is recycled.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, set up by the record-breaking sailor, announced on Wednesday that the brands were joining its Make Fashion Circular scheme to reduce global waste from fashion by recycling raw materials and products.  The head of the Make Fashion Circular initiative, Francois Souchet, said the aim was to create a \u201cunstoppable momentum\u201d towards an economy in which clothes are never seen as waste.  \u201cOver the past 15 years clothing production has doubled, while the amount of time we wear those clothes before throwing them away \u2013 usually to be landfilled or incinerated \u2013 has fallen dramatically,\u201d Souchet told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  \u201cWe can change this ever faster model into one in which clothes are never seen as waste, through better design and new leasing and resale business models,\u201d he said in an email.  The four brands will join British designer Stella McCartney, who last year became the first to sign up to the initiative, which aims to eliminate waste and pollution and ensure products and materials are reused.  At the time McCartney, a long-time advocate of sustainable fashion, said her industry was \u201cincredibly wasteful and harmful to the environment\u201d, urging other brands to join.  In a report published in November, the Foundation exposed the scale of waste and pollution in the fashion industry, revealing that less than one percent of clothing is recycled.  Half a million tonnes of plastic microfibres are released from washed clothing annually, equivalent to more than 50 billion plastic bottles, exacerbating ocean pollution, the report said.  The participating brands will spend three years developing practical ways in which the industry can move away from polluting materials and processes, working with HSBC bank.  \u201cThere is no single company that can solve the challenge of shifting the whole industry from a linear to a circular business model on its own, that is why a collaborative approach is crucial,\u201d said H&M spokesman I\u00f1igo S\u00e1enz Maestre in an email.  H&M has set a target of only using recycled or other sustainably sourced materials by 2030, he said, and 35 percent of its garments are currently produced that way.","95":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday criticized Nike Inc for its new advertising campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, the NFL quarterback who sparked controversy by kneeling in protest during the national anthem.  Trump, without offering evidence, said in a post on Twitter that the sportswear company was \u201cgetting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts.\u201d He also continued to blast National Football League players for their protests over racial and social injustice.  Representatives for Nike could not be immediately reached for comment on Trump\u2019s tweet. Shares of the company were up less than one percent in midmorning trade on Wednesday; the stock had dropped nearly 4 percent at one point on Tuesday.  The footwear and apparel maker\u2019s campaign this week further stoked a national debate over social justice that Kaepernick and other NFL players sparked with their protests aimed at addressing police brutality against minorities, racial injustice, and reforming the criminal justice system.  Trump has embraced the issue as a political cause, frequently criticizing players for taking a knee at games and questioning their patriotism. Critics have defended their protests as a fundamental American right to free speech.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  On Tuesday, he criticized Nike\u2019s decision but also appeared to defend the right for such movements.  Marketing experts predicted that the brand recognition sparked by the ads would be successful in the long run, despite current calls for boycotts on social media.

FILE PHOTO: A person wearing a protective face mask amid the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) walks past a Nike brand store central in Kyiv, Ukraine December 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Valentyn Ogirenko  Between January and November this year, the Nike Run Club app was downloaded 15.4 million times around the world, up 45.3% versus the same period in 2019, according to data firm Sensor Tower. The Nike SNKRS online store app was downloaded 59.5% times more than last year.  Through its apps, Nike has information ranging from people\u2019s height and weight to locations and browsing habits. Nike can tap into these details to craft ads and attract customers, three investors in Nike and several analysts said.  Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment about how it uses app data.  At a Morgan Stanley conference in November, Nike Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said the retailer added about 55 million new customers to its member database this year.  The company\u2019s practices generally seem to be in line with those of other retailers with advanced ecommerce operations, according to lawyers who advise retailers on how they can use consumer data.  Nike, however, has a \u201csignificant advantage\u201d over rivals because of its workout apps. It likely has several scientists using the data to see if shoppers will tolerate higher prices, said Mary Hildebrand, who heads law firm Lowenstein Sandler\u2019s privacy and cybersecurity practice.  The world\u2019s biggest sportswear company has recently launched pricey sneakers like some Nike Adapt BB 2.0s that sell for $400, or low-top Dior Air Jordan 1s that cost about $2,000. Nike has also spent on technology to make products like its lightweight, roughly $220 Nike Air VaporMax 2020 Flyknits that use recycled polyester yarn.  \u201cEarly in the pandemic, Nike made in-app workouts for its Nike Training Club app free. This was a masterstroke ... They know everything - exactly what you\u2019re searching, where you live, what your credit card details are, how much you\u2019re willing to pay,\u201d said Michael Faherty, a portfolio manager at Nike investor Seilern Investment Management.  \u201cI absolutely think that this increased visibility gives them more pricing power,\u201d Faherty said.  Nike has also this year increased prices of older styles, like the Air Force 1 \u201807 and Air VaporMax Plus, which ran in November for $109.19 and $198.24 respectively, according to StyleSage, which scraped data from Nike\u2019s website.  On Friday, Nike is expected to report a 2.2% increase in second-quarter sales, boosted by another sharp increase in digital sales. Ramiz Chelat, a portfolio manager at Nike investor Vontobel Asset Management, said new products in Nike\u2019s Air Zoom line, for instance, were priced at a premium \u2013 roughly $200 in some cases - that is driving gross margins.  When signing up for the Nike Run Club app, iPhone users have the option to sync their account with their Apple Health app to \u201ckeep close track of all your fitness data.\u201d  Users need to provide information like gender, height and weight before the app allows them to sign up for \u201cguided runs\u201d or \u201cfive-minute runs.\u201d Information like this can help gauge customer demand \u2013 for instance, knowing that more women are watching a particular workout means Nike may also know what products to place in that video.

Managers at five Nike stores in Beijing and Shanghai told Reuters during visits on Thursday they had been told in recent days via a memo from management that all Rockets merchandise had to be removed. Reuters was unable to view the memo.  Although Rockets general manager Daryl Morey has since apologized for his tweet last week, National Basketball Association (NBA) Commissioner Adam Silver further angered authorities when he said the league backed Morey\u2019s right to exercise his freedom of expression.  Despite the controversy, the NBA was pressing ahead with an exhibition game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai on Thursday night. Promotional events earlier in the week had been canceled.  The stakes are high for NBA, whose league business in China is said to be worth more than $4 billion.

For over a decade, the retail industry has battled so-called \u201cscalper bots,\u201d programmed to cut digital lines and snap up limited-supply products within milliseconds of their release, that are resold at significant mark-ups.  The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated the problem because the boom in online shopping expanded scalpers\u2019 sights to new categories from fitness equipment to essential goods like toilet paper and detergents. In Britain, scalpers using bots have also snatched online grocery delivery slots reserved for at-risk senior citizens.  The Joe Biden administration said this week that it will soon start distributing about 1 million doses per week directly to about 6,500 pharmacies in the first phase of a federal program that aims to expand access to vaccines.  Security companies that track this activity now warn that U.S. retailers and pharmacies enlisted to play a big role in COVID-19 vaccine dissemination could be the next target of bot attacks as they begin distributing as early as Feb. 11.  These fears stem from problems retailers have faced this past holiday shopping season, when the latest PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox consoles were nearly impossible to find because scalpers attacked major retailers.  \u201cQueue-jumpers are branching out.

Walmart told Reuters in December most of the \u201csignificantly higher\u201d traffic for the consoles came from bots, and that the company had to conduct after-sale audits, cancelling orders placed by bots and making those products available to regular consumers.

When asked if it was worried about bots attacking Covid-19 vaccine appointments, Walmart said it would \u201cfocus on security and any necessary mitigation steps that help us provide fair and equitable vaccination sign-ups.\u201d  Walmart said in a blog post on Tuesday that, starting late next week, once the retailer receives doses from the federal government at select pharmacies in 22 states, vaccine-eligible customers can use a scheduling tool to lock in appointments online \u201cwhile allocation lasts.\u201d  Such websites, however, make retailers easier targets for bots than the states currently handling vaccine appointments, two cybersecurity experts said.  Securing appointments by going through local governments requires a more complicated process of navigating different websites. This makes it harder for both people and bots to complete the process.  The complexity of securing vaccine appointments from the government, even without explicit evidence of bots tampering the process, inspired a few programmers to create website monitoring programs like Georgia Vax, Visualping and NYC Vaccine List, which alert people to available appointments at a local level for free.  \u201cIt would be hard for anyone to really make a lot of money attacking states because every county is different,\u201d said Ben Warlick, an Atlanta-based lawyer who has been writing appointment monitoring bots for free to help people get the vaccine. \u201cCreating a large nationwide system would just be too difficult to set up.\u201d  But for retailers, the threat is real.  \u201cSeveral of our customers have come to us worried about the frightening dilemma they will ultimately face: how do we manage vaccine appointments without it being upended by automated, bot attacks?\u201d said Edward Roberts, a specialist at security firm Imperva.

The private sector is girding for tech problems. \u201cThe Walgreens team is working to ensure only authorized and eligible patients will have access to schedule a vaccine appointment,\u201d said Jim Cameli, Walgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s Chief Information Security Officer.  \u201dTo do so, security measures such as bot detection and prevention will play key roles in delivering this critical service to patients.\u201d  CVS said its program could thwart bot attacks. \u201cOur vaccination appointment site has a layered defense that includes capabilities to detect automated cyber attacks, such as botnets. Those capabilities, together with our application design and user input validation, enable us to validate legitimate users,\u201d a CVS Health spokesman said.  When asked if it was worried about bots attacking Covid-19 vaccine appointments, Walmart said it would \u201cfocus on security and any necessary mitigation steps that help us provide fair and equitable vaccination sign-ups.\u201d  Walmart said in a blog post on Tuesday that, starting late next week, once the retailer receives doses from the federal government at select pharmacies in 22 states, vaccine-eligible customers can use a scheduling tool to lock in appointments online \u201cwhile allocation lasts.\u201d  Such websites, however, make retailers easier targets for bots than the states currently handling vaccine appointments, two cybersecurity experts said.  Securing appointments by going through local governments requires a more complicated process of navigating different websites. This makes it harder for both people and bots to complete the process.  The complexity of securing vaccine appointments from the government, even without explicit evidence of bots tampering the process, inspired a few programmers to create website monitoring programs like Georgia Vax, Visualping and NYC Vaccine List, which alert people to available appointments at a local level for free.  The National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) said on a media call Friday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) plans to launch \u201cVaccine Finder,\u201d a tool the health organization has \u201cdeveloped over time\u201d to help those eligible locate the vaccine.  The CDC was not immediately available for comment.  \u201cIt would be hard for anyone to really make a lot of money attacking states because every county is different,\u201d said Ben Warlick, an Atlanta-based lawyer who has been writing appointment monitoring bots for free to help people get the vaccine. \u201cCreating a large nationwide system would just be too difficult to set up.\u201d  But for retailers, the threat is real.  \u201cSeveral of our customers have come to us worried about the frightening dilemma they will ultimately face: how do we manage vaccine appointments without it being upended by automated, bot attacks?\u201d said Edward Roberts, a specialist at security firm Imperva.  He added, \u201cThe dam will explode once vaccines are available for all citizens.\u201d","105":"Sept 23 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow opened higher on Wednesday, with Nike hitting a record high following a strong quarterly earnings report, while investors looked to domestic business activity data to gauge the pace of an economic rebound.

The Nike swoosh decorates the outfits of Brazil, France and England, the sides in the quarter-finals most favored by betting websites to win the World Cup, plus Croatia.  Top German sports brand Adidas has Belgium, Russia and Sweden in the quarter-finals, with the group of eight rounded out by Uruguay, sponsored by Puma SE PUMG.DE.  The combined accomplishments of Nike-sponsored teams in Russia mark a major success for the U.S. sports apparel maker as it pushes to increase global soccer-related sales that reached more than $2 billion in fiscal 2018.  \u201cWhile Adidas dominates the European leagues and the U.S. professional league, certainly any market share that Nike can pick up in a nontraditional U.S. sport can only bode well for the stock price and brand,\u201d said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Sports brands typically sell the bulk of their fan merchandise ahead of the World Cup, but a team\u2019s success on the field can generate extra demand for gear emblazoned with its emblems and colors, especially if its progress is unexpected.  Nike kitted out more teams than Adidas for the first time in Brazil in 2014. Adidas fought back this year, sponsoring 12 of the 32 participating teams, including strong early contenders Germany and Spain, along with host Russia.

To view a graphic on Nike extending leads in the World Cup jersey battle, click: reut.rs\/2KP51I8  The tournament took a disastrous turn for Adidas last Wednesday, with the unexpected elimination of 2014 champion Germany. Shares of Adidas, Germany\u2019s team sponsor, fell 2.7 percent in the following session.  In 2014, Germany accounted for a third of Adidas\u2019 roughly 9 million team jersey sales, Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia wrote in a recent client note, with an incremental 10 percent of those sales resulting from Germany\u2019s tournament victory.  Over the weekend, high-profile Adidas-sponsored teams Argentina and Spain were eliminated. Likewise, Mexico lost to Nike-sponsored Brazil on Monday.  Heading into this year\u2019s World Cup, Adidas downplayed the sporting event\u2019s potential effect on sales, pointing to Russia\u2019s tepid economy.  But the World Cup remains a major marketing opportunity for Adidas, which is one of seven FIFA partners and the supplier of the World Cup match ball since 1970.  As well as team jerseys, sponsorship of top individual players is critical for the promotion of soccer shoes. Ahead of the World Cup, Nike expected 60 percent of players heading to Russia to use its footwear.  Since the start of the World Cup on June 14, Nike\u2019s stock is up almost 3 percent, helped mostly by a strong quarterly report and sales outlook last Thursday. Adidas has lost about 5 percent.","108":"(Reuters) - Foot Locker FL.N shares jumped 20 percent on Wednesday after third-quarter results showed shoe sales turning back to growth thanks to a boost from Nike's latest lines, heading off fears it was losing out to Amazon AMZN.O and other online stores.

Analysts have feared that Nike's NKE.N move about two years ago to begin selling via Amazon and its own stores would hurt Foot Locker and other third-party sellers which rely on relationships with manufacturers to pull shoppers.  But Tuesday\u2019s results suggested that Foot Locker\u2019s tie-up with Nike was intact, and even growing, leading at least seven Wall Street analysts to raise their 12-month targets on the New York-based retailer\u2019s stock price.  \u201cFoot Locker\u2019s position continues to improve and it remains a top destination for Sneakerheads and a strong partner for multiple brands, including Nike,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Christopher Svezia said in a report.  Its ability to continue collaborating with Nike to launch products exclusively for its core shoppers is keeping sales humming, said Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez at Telsey Advisory Group.  The two companies have tied up to improve the customer experience in stores by hiring trained associates to inform shoppers about exclusive sneaker launches by Nike.  In Los Angeles Foot Locker launched a Jumpman store with an investment from Nike\u2019s Jordan brand to house curated Jordan collections.  \u201cI get excited about launches, but I get more excited about the collaborations that we\u2019ve got with our great vendor partners,\u201d Richard Johnson, Foot Locker\u2019s chief executive officer, said on Tuesday\u2019s conference call with analysts.

Stichter raised her price target on Foot Locker shares by $2 to $62. The stock was last up 15 percent at $53 in premarket trading.  If the gains hold, Foot Locker shares are on track for a five-month high, setting them on course to finish higher in 2018.","109":"A federal magistrate judge in Oregon has recommended that Nike Inc\u2019s bid to toss out proposed class action claims that the company pays women less than men should be denied, saying female workers in various job roles have enough in common to move forward.

FILE PHOTO: People leave a factory of Brazilian company Dass Group where Nike shoes are manufactured, in Eldorado, Argentina October 24, 2019. REUTERS\/Cassandra Garrison  When his key card for the turnstile failed, Aquino realized the rumors were true. The plant was cutting hundreds of workers as orders from the U.S. apparel giant stalled, amid a swirling economic crisis that has plunged the country into recession for most of the last year.  The Nike factory in Misiones province, one of Argentina\u2019s poorest, is proving to be the tip of the iceberg. Around Argentina, nearly 16,000 textile and shoe factory workers have lost their jobs in the last year, according to government data, including nearly a quarter of all shoe sector workers.  And the outlook is darkening: the peso currency has tumbled, interest rates are above 60% and annual inflation nearly 54%.  In this lush jungle town with dusty red-dirt roads, laid-off workers, union delegates and locals Reuters spoke with on a recent trip had one person to blame: President Mauricio Macri, who was defeated outright in a general election on Sunday.  Macri, who came to power in late 2015 as a business-friendly candidate to industry cheers, moved to cut trade barriers, helping bolster overseas ties and increase competition for domestic suppliers. That compounded an unexpectedly sharp economic downturn since last year that has hammered consumer spending inside the country.  At the Nike plant in Eldorado that meant the factory was up against a wave of cheaper imports even as local manufacturing costs got higher. As costs rose, importing finished products became a more attractive option, industry experts said.  \u201cIt\u2019s just another job the government is getting rid of,\u201d Aquino said of his first thought upon learning that the owner of the Misiones plant, Brazil\u2019s Dass Group, was cutting workers last December.  Aquino spoke to Reuters on the porch of the modest brick house where he lives with his wife and two children. He said his home was possible thanks to the previous government of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, vice-president on the winning ticket on Sunday.  \u201cI worked seven and a half years for the company. With my earnings, I could eat and support my family,\u201d said Aquino, who said he has since taken on an informal job as a driver to make ends meet. \u201cI can\u2019t let my children be in need.\u201d  Nike declined to comment on the reason for cutting back on its orders at the Misiones plant, but said in a statement it \u201ccontinues to evaluate our sourcing strategy based on seasonal needs and the local marketplace.\u201d  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Representatives from Dass Group, the Brazilian company that runs the factory, and the shoe workers\u2019 union, UTICRA, both blamed the job cuts on a steep 70% drop in shoe orders from Nike, which accounts for nearly all the factory\u2019s work.  The dynamics in Eldorado are a key reason Argentina\u2019s left-leaning Peronists have toppled market-friendly conservative Macri, whose popularity was hit as industries from carmakers to vinters in the country have reeled from falling sales.  \u201cProduction is down because of what is happening in the country, a drastic fall in consumption. It\u2019s a reality that is affecting us all,\u201d said Dario Vera, the factory\u2019s delegate for shoe workers\u2019 union UTICRA.  He said the sector had taken a turn for the worse in recent years under Macri's more open-door policies, such as slashing red tape that required importers to seek authorization from the national revenue service. Vera pointed to another factory closure in Chivilcoy near Buenos Aires last December after Nike-rival Adidas AG ADSGn.DE cut back orders.  The union, he said, was now supporting Fernandez, who has pledged to support domestic industry and revive local consumption, and could roll back some of Macri\u2019s free-trade policies to appease powerful worker unions.  HIGH PRICE TO PAY  The malaise in Misiones, a province sandwiched between Brazil and Paraguay, reflects a wider struggle for Argentina\u2019s clothing and textile sectors, which have been hit by a 14.6% drop in retail sales in the first seven months of 2019, according to government data based on shopping mall purchases.  Around the country, the textile and shoe sectors employ 107,000 people, the latest labor ministry data show, down around 13% over the last year. The shoe segment is down 23%.  There were over 1.4 million unemployed people in Argentina in the second quarter of the year, an increase of 200,000 people versus the same period in 2018, government data show.  \u201cWith high tax pressure on the sector, plus recession and a very high interest rate, all that combined... means the sector produces less,\u201d said Jose Depena, director of the finance department at the University of CEMA in Buenos Aires.  He said that the mainly small and medium-sized firms which make up the bulk of the sector were very capital intensive, with little automation to cut costs.  That means locally-made clothes often come with a high price-tag in the South American country, which has driven demand for cheaper imports that have risen steadily since 2015, hitting a peak last year of $331 million, industry data show.  \u201cMaking textiles here is unbearable because we have so many steps in the middle,\u201d said Gabriel Cures Sastre of Buenos Aires-based trade-focused consultancy GCS Commercial.  \u201cCutting the fabric, sewing it, doing the glue for the pockets. All of these processes end up as high added-value and the product becomes very expensive.\u201d  \u2018INDISCRIMINATE IMPORTS\u2019  Vera, the Eldorado factory\u2019s delegate for UTICRA, said in recent years Nike had started importing 20,000 pairs of shoes daily - nearly the same amount the plant once produced. The union has called for rules to avoid \u201cindiscriminate imports.\u201d  \u201cIn Eldorado, we are living a complex, sad situation. Being in a city that\u2019s not very big and being away from the big cities is a difficult situation for us,\u201d said Vera.  At its peak, the factory employed 1,500 workers and churned out 23,000 pairs of Nike shoes per day for the domestic market, factory officials said. It was the largest of 12 Nike manufacturers in Argentina, Nike\u2019s own manufacturing map shows.  Now production has dwindled to just 7,000 pairs daily.  Around 400 workers have lost their jobs since the layoffs started in December last year. Another 300 are set to be let go as soon as this week and hundreds more by the end of the year as orders dwindle further, Vera said.  Flavio Eduardo Olea, human resources and labor relations manager at the factory, said the plant was pursuing talks with Nike to stem the decline, but things were looking grim - a reflection of Argentina\u2019s challenge ahead to revive growth.  \u201cThe company, with this amount of workers that are left, would be economically unfeasible,\u201d he said.","113":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Nike Inc shut down its Nike Oregon Project training group on Thursday, following the recent four-year ban of founder and coach Alberto Salazar by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA).

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to three criminal counts. Jury selection is scheduled to begin on Monday in Manhattan federal court. The trial could last three weeks.  WHAT ARE THE CHARGES?  Prosecutors said Avenatti threatened to hold a press conference, based on information from his client Gary Franklin, accusing Nike officials of making and trying to conceal illegal payments to families of top college basketball recruits.  Franklin\u2019s team, California Supreme, had been in the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League.  Avenatti allegedly agreed not to hold the press conference if Nike agreed to pay Franklin $1.5 million, and also pay Avenatti $15 million to $25 million to conduct an internal probe, along with another lawyer.  Evidence includes secret recordings of Avenatti allegedly making threats, which prosecutors said were made after Nike brought his activity to their attention.  Nike has denied wrongdoing.  The defendant faces two extortion-related counts. He is also charged with honest services wire fraud for allegedly concealing from Franklin a settlement offer made by Nike, and using the coach\u2019s accusations to extract riches for himself.  Avenatti faces more than 40 years in prison if convicted, but would likely get less.  WHAT IS AVENATTI\u2019S DEFENSE?  Avenatti has said it violates the constitutional right to free speech under the First Amendment for a civil lawyer to be prosecuted for threatening to truthfully expose misconduct by Nike that directly related to his client\u2019s claims.  He has also said the honest services fraud charge should have been dismissed because there were no bribes or kickbacks.  In addition, Avenatti has said that prosecutors rushed to indict him as payback for his role as a \u201chigh-profile political antagonist\u201d of Trump, after he began representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against the president.  WHAT OTHER LEGAL RISKS DOES AVENATTI FACE?  Prosecutors in Manhattan have separately charged Avenatti with stealing about $300,000 from Daniels after helping her secure a book contract.  Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford and who Avenatti no longer represents, had accused Trump of having an affair with her in 2006, a claim the president has denied.  The most serious criminal case Avenatti faces is in southern California.  Prosecutors there accused him of stealing millions of dollars from clients, lying to the Internal Revenue Service and a bankruptcy court, and defrauding a bank. Avenatti faces up to 335 years in prison if convicted, but would likely get less.

Net income rose to $1.14 billion, or 69 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended May 31, from $1.01 billion, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items, the company earned 69 cents per share, beating estimates of 64 cents.  Total revenue rose 12.8 percent to $9.79 billion, also topping estimates of $9.41 billion.  The company, which has set a $50 billion revenue target for 2020, said fiscal 2018 sales rose 6 percent to $36.40 billion.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  The withdrawal came fewer than 24 hours after prosecutors called the subpoena a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d unrelated to the extortion case, which the U.S. Department of Justice announced in March. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty.  Nike had also opposed the subpoena in a letter made public on Friday, and Avenatti\u2019s lawyers said they did not know until then that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York already had the documents they wanted.  \u201cBecause Nike has now confirmed, for the first time, that the USAO-SDNY possesses all of the documents that Mr. Avenatti seeks from Nike -- and the USAO-SDNY accepts Nike\u2019s representation -- we are withdrawing our request for a ... subpoena to Nike,\u201d wrote Scott Srebnick, a lawyer for Avenatti.  Srebnick said he will discuss with prosecutors which documents will be turned over and if necessary, file motions to obtain documents that might help Avenatti\u2019s defense.  Prosecutors accused Avenatti of threatening to publicize claims that Nike arranged for payments to elite college basketball recruits unless the athletic wear company paid him more than $20 million and hired him to manage an internal probe.  Avenatti, 48, became famous for representing porn star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, in lawsuits involving U.S. President Donald Trump and his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen.  He also faces federal charges in Manhattan of stealing about $300,000 from Daniels after helping her secure a book contract.  In a decision late Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts in Manhattan rejected Avenatti\u2019s request to move that case to California, saying that two key witnesses, Daniels\u2019 agent and her publisher, were in New York.  Federal prosecutors in Southern California have separately charged Avenatti with wire fraud, bank fraud and other crimes, saying he stole millions of dollars from clients.  Avenatti has also pleaded not guilty to charges in the Daniels and California cases, which he had argued were similar.  He said in an email earlier Tuesday about the Nike case: \u201cI look forward to a jury hearing the real truth as to what happened as opposed to the fairytale scripted by Trump\u2019s DOJ.\u201d  The case is U.S. v.

U.S. President Donald Trump has been critical of athletes taking a knee during the national anthem and has said he would love to see NFL owners fire football players who disrespect the American flag.  Nike, who confirmed on Monday that Kaepernick was part of the campaign and called him \u201cone of the inspirational athletes of his generation\u201d, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.

Shares rose 13% and are set to open on Wednesday at an all-time high of about $132.  Nike\u2019s brick-and-mortar sales have fallen since the COVID-19 pandemic began, as malls and department stores were shuttered around the world. To combat that, the footwear maker has turned its focus to direct-to-consumer sales, especially through its own website and apps.  The brand\u2019s digital sales surged 82% in the first quarter ended Aug. 31, with at least double-digit rises recorded in all regions. In the prior quarter, Nike reported a 75% increase in online sales - nearly a third of total revenue, a goal Nike had previously set for 2023.  \u201cWe know that digital is the new normal. The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back,\u201d Nike Chief Executive John Donahoe said.  Nike said it expected fiscal full-year revenue to rise between high single digits and low double digits versus last year, saying second-half sales would be \u201cup significantly,\u201d even though first-half growth would be flat. Analysts forecast a fiscal 2021 sales rise of 5.9%, according to Refinitiv IBES.  U.S. retailers including Foot Locker Inc and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc - which canceled shipments in the early days of the pandemic - have begun making orders for inventory in the second half of Nike\u2019s fiscal year, analysts say.

He warned, however, that the stock would be sold off if it misses any quarters coming up.  Tuesday\u2019s results are a far cry from those of just a quarter ago, when Nike reported a surprise loss of $790 million as retailers canceled orders and people kept away from Nike stores in key markets like North America, Europe and China.  Shares in the Portland, Oregon-based company have risen 16% this year. Nike has gained favor among shoppers this year with investments in marketing itself as a socially conscious company, prominently supporting movements like Black Lives Matter and Time to Vote.  First-quarter sales in China, where the economy opened from lockdowns much earlier than in other parts of the world, rose 6%, led by factory stores and online sales.  The company\u2019s net income rose to $1.52 billion, or 95 cents per share, from $1.37 billion, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier.

Kinyua was found by the board to have \u201cengaged in similar conduct\u201d but as he was not an IAAF official at the time, it was deemed that he was not bound by the ethics rules in place at the time and hence he escaped sanction.  The two men, along with former AK President Isaiah Kiplagat, were provisionally suspended at the end of 2015. Kiplagat has since died and consequently the ethics board dropped its investigation into his activities.  APPEAL RULING  Okeyo and Kinyua deny wrongdoing, saying that the money was legitimate payment for their own expenses and expertise and for payments they personally made to athletes.  Okeyo said: \u201cMy lawyers will appeal the ruling. I think it\u2019s discriminatory. All three of us were signatories to our bank. We will appeal.\u201d  Kinyua told Reuters on Thursday that he was happy with the decision and that \u201cjustice was done\u201d.  At the time of their suspensions Nike said the company had acted with integrity in its dealings with AK and that the \u201cexpectation and understanding\u201d of the sponsorship deal was that the funds would be used to support and service the teams and athletes.  The judgement, however, showed that Nike had clearly been concerned about how the funds were being used and that the ethics panel was satisfied that in many, though not all of the instances it investigated, funds were being siphoned off.  \u201cIn failing to disclose the honorarium and service fee payments to the membership of AK, the panel is comfortably satisfied that the defendants diverted funds of AK for their own direct or indirect personal benefit, as charged,\u201d the Board said in its findings.  \u201cIn the view of the panel, Mr Okeyo\u2019s conduct in failing as Secretary General of AK ... constituted conduct likely to bring the sport of athletics into disrepute.\u201d  On one occasion in 2010 Okeyo withdrew $200,000 from AK accounts, saying subsequently that the money was used by AK to promote its athletics programs.  However, the panel said that Okeyo could not produce any evidence to show that the executive board had approved this course of action, \u201cnor did he provide any details as to what programs had been supported, nor did he furnish any evidence by way of payment vouchers or supporting invoices to corroborate his account.\u201d  The report added: \u201cUnder cross-examination, when asked to explain the purpose for the withdrawal of $200,000, Mr Okeyo could provide no explanation, other than that he had been instructed to withdraw the money.\u201d  Okeyo has also been charged with the extortion of money from athletes but the ethics panel will issue a separate decision in relation to that charge.","137":"FILE PHOTO: A silhouette of a woman wearing a protective face shield and a protective face mask is seen near to a Nike logo at a shopping mall in Jakarta, Indonesia, June 15, 2020.

In a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez said recent reports indicated a wide array of U.S. companies, including Apple, Kraft Heinz , Coca-Cola, and the Gap, had sourced, or continued to source, goods from Xinjiang.  \u201cMoreover, there are consistent reports that U.S. companies fail to undertake basic labor and human rights assessments in Xinjiang, in essence willfully ignoring the horrific conditions of forced labor in Xinjiang,\u201d Menendez, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said in the letter.  \u201cIn failing to uphold their responsibilities to vet their supply chains, these companies may be complicit in the mass repression of Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups,\u201d he said.  The firms Menendez mentioned did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The United Nations estimates more than a million Muslim Uighurs have been detained in camps in Xinjiang in recent years. China denies it violates Uighur rights and says the camps are designed to stamp out terrorism and provide vocational skills.  Menendez, who has called for sanctions on China over the issue, also requested information about U.S. government contractors who source cotton from China, which produces 84% of its cotton in Xinjiang.  \u201cThe use of materials that are manufactured using forced labor is unacceptable for products in U.S. markets,\u201d he said in the letter.  An Australian think tank said in a report earlier this month that tens of thousands of ethnic Uighurs have been transferred to work in factories across China supplying 83 global brands in conditions \u201cthat strongly suggest forced labor.\u201d  Nike Inc, which was included in that report, said in a statement on its website that while the company \u201cdoes not directly source products from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region\u201d, it had been conducting due diligence with its suppliers in China to identify and assess potential risks related to employment of people from the region.  On Monday, the Washington-based Fair Labor Association, which conducts due diligence for major multinational firms, said it was \u201cdeeply troubled by credible reports of forced labor and other violations of fundamental rights in Xinjiang.\u201d  \u201cWe have directed our affiliates to review their direct and indirect sourcing relationships, identify alternative sourcing opportunities, and develop timebound plans to ensure that their sourcing is in line with the FLA\u2019s principles,\u201d it said.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  On Wednesday Nike Inc launched a new version of the shoe that complies with rules introduced by the governing body last week to limit carbon plate usage and sole thickness for elite races following concerns that technological developments were giving runners an unnatural advantage.  The latest incarnation of the shoe is the Air Zoom Alphafly Next%, with one curved, carbon plate, an insole thickness of 39.5mm, as well added air pockets. The new rules - the WA\u2019s first governing running shoe specifications - state road shoes must have insoles no thicker than 40mm and not contain more than one rigid, embedded carbon fiber plate.  \u201cWe are pleased the Nike Zoom Vaporfly series and Nike Zoom Alphafly NEXT% remain legal,\u201d said the U.S company. \u201cWe will continue our dialogue with World Athletics and the industry on new standards.\u201d  Nike followed that on Thursday by saying the shoes used by Kipchoge for his unofficial sub-two hour marathon in Vienna last October would still be legal even under the new rules.  \u201cWe don\u2019t make running shoes with three plates,\u201d a Nike spokesperson told Reuters, adding that the midsole thickness was also within the new parameters. Industry speculation that Kipchoge\u2019s shoes were triple-plated was based on Nike\u2019s 2018 patent for a shoe containing triple plates.  WA President Sebastian Coe, who was a Nike ambassador for 38 years until stepping down in 2015, said last week after most of Nike\u2019s Vaporflys were deemed legal that WA \u201cdon\u2019t believe we can rule out shoes that have been generally available for a considerable period of time\u201d.  Another change introduced last week by WA states that, from April 30, any future version, of any shoe, must have been available to the general public for four months before being allowed in elite competition. Limited numbers of the new Alphafly shoes will be made available from this month, thereby ensuring they will be legal for use at this year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics.  In the unofficial Vienna marathon, Kipchoge wore a prototype which would seemingly have been at odds with the prevailing rule for World Athletics-sanctioned races that said any shoe should be \u201creasonably available\u201d, though that rule was never applied by the governing body through the various prototype versions of the shoe, which was launched as the Vaporfly in 2016.  The shoe has since contributed to a host of major records and big-race wins and has become hugely popular with recreational runners suddenly slicing minutes off their best times. WA ruled last week that most of the models in the range would remain legal, much to the frustration of many observers who consider the shoes to be \u201cmechanical doping\u201d.  Former elite British marathon runner Tam Yamauchi said WA had \u201cgiven the green light to performance-enhancing shoes\u201d, with others predicting they will produce a legal sub-two record, possibly as early as this year\u2019s London Marathon in April when Kipchoge, the current holder, goes head to head with Kenenisa Bekele.  After launching the new Alphafly version on Wednesday, Nike Chief Executive John Donahoe denied that the technology gives athletes a mechanical advantage.  \u201cIt\u2019s simply using the same materials that go into a shoe and putting them together in an innovative way that allows the athlete to do their very best in a safe way,\u201d Donahoe said in an interview with CNBC.","141":"Nike Inc on Tuesday urged a judge to put on hold a recent ruling in favor of rival Fleet Feet Inc that blocked the sportswear giant from using the slogan \u201cSport Changes Everything\u201d in an ad campaign.

The brand\u2019s digital sales, especially in North America, helped offset fall in sales at traditional brick-and-mortar stores due to COVID-19 restrictions and social-distancing measures.

The company\u2019s double-digit percentage growth in China was in addition to strong demand in North America, Nike\u2019s biggest and most competitive market, where sales got a boost from higher full-priced sales and a rebound in Jordan sneakers.  In a note titled \u201cA perfect quarter in an imperfect world,\u201d Jefferies analyst said that Nike\u2019s results this quarter were perfect amidst global trade disruption cited by FedEx.

Nike has focused on new launches as well as on a direct-to-customer model of own stores and online sales to temper the hit from bankruptcies of sports retailers and competition from the likes of Adidas AG and Under Armour Inc in the United States.  Its efforts have borne fruit. The company engineered a rebound in its North America market, clawing back market share from global rivals.  \u201cNike is boxing out its competition ... the results illuminate the progress that Nike has made, and the guidance, which appears conservative, highlights the opportunities ahead,\u201d Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser wrote in a note.

FILE PHOTO: People walk past a Nike store in New York City, New York, U.S., September 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri\/File Photo  The campaign, along with Nike\u2019s increasing efforts to woo younger customers with new sneakers and jerseys, had led to expectations that the company would lift its outlook for the year.  \u201cA combination of heightened expectations going into the company\u2019s results, a slight disappointment in gross margins, as well as tepid second-quarter guidance is causing a wobbliness in the company\u2019s stock,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Christopher Svezia said.

The ad featuring Kaepernick, first aired in early September days after Nike\u2019s fiscal quarter ended, revived a nationwide debate that began in 2016 when the San Francisco 49ers quarterback began kneeling during the national anthem at games to protest police shootings of unarmed black men.  In reaction to the ad, protesters burned Nike shoes and called for a boycott of its products. Nike shares fell 3 percent the day after the ad was first aired.  Yet in the following weeks, analysts and marketing experts said they expected the ad to bring more attention to Nike and bump up sales.  Nike currently expects full-year revenue growth at the lower end of a high-single digit range due to a stronger dollar.  In the quarter ended August, Oregon-based Nike\u2019s revenue rose 10 percent, beating Wall Street estimates. Profit also exceeded expectations even as higher commodity costs hit margins.  After the report, analysts remained bullish and at least five raised their price targets on Nike\u2019s stock.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Puma, which has put a big focus on soccer and running in recent years and makes the bulk of its sales in Europe, has hinted for some time that it was considering returning to major American sports after pulling out of basketball 17 years ago.  Puma said it will partner with athletes and celebrities linked to basketball, noting that basketball shoes still dominate U.S. footwear sales although Nike and Under Armour UAA.N have been hit by a shift away from basketball performance shoes to more retro styles in the last few years.  Nike has the contract to supply NBA uniforms.  Puma made the announcement as it issued new medium-term targets at a capital markets day.  Puma said it sees \u201csubstantial upside\u201d for the brand in the U.S. market, while it expects Greater China - where basketball is also popular - to be its top market by 2022, according to slides prepared for the presentation to investors.  Puma shares jumped 5.5 percent by 1136 GMT, the second biggest German small-cap gainer .SDAX. The stock had dipped after French parent Kering PRTP.PA said in January it would spin off the brand, before rallying on an upbeat 2018 outlook.  Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden has revived Puma\u2019s fortunes over the past five years by sponsoring top soccer teams and partnering with celebrities including singer Rihanna. However, its profitability lags well behind bigger local rival Adidas and market leader Nike.  A focus on the U.S. and Chinese markets should help it boost profits as currently lacks scale in the former, while profit margins are the highest in the sporting goods industry in China.  Puma said on Tuesday it wants to lift its operating profit margin to about 10 percent of sales by 2022 at the latest, up from the 5.6 percent it reported in 2017, and versus 9.8 percent at Adidas and the 13.8 percent Nike saw in fiscal 2016\/17.  Shares in Adidas jumped last week after it raised its operating margin target to 11.5 percent for 2020.  Puma expects currency-adjusted consolidated net sales to grow around 10 percent on average per year until 2022 and said it will propose a dividend of between 25 and 35 percent of consolidated net earnings starting in 2019.  It wants sales from its own stores and ecommerce to account for 30 percent of sales in the medium-term, up from 23 percent now, a shift away from wholesale that should also support margins by cutting out the middleman of other retailers.","149":"* Nike shares surge after strong results, forecast  * Financials gain after lenders pass Fed\u2019s stress test  * Core PCE hits Fed\u2019s May target of 2 pct  * Indexes up: Dow 1.05 pct, S&P 0.82 pct, Nasdaq 0.61 pct  * Dow and S&P set for best one-day gain since June 6 (Changes comment, adds details, updates prices)  By Amy Caren Daniel  June 29 (Reuters) - A surge in Nike\u2019s shares and a rally in bank stocks on Friday set the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 on track for their best day in a little over three weeks.

That signaled an end to a rough period marked by strong competition from German rival Adidas AG ADSGn.DE and prompted at least 11 Wall Street brokerages to raise price targets on its stock far above a current $87.  Evercore ISI set a price target of $150, compared with a current Wall Street median of $100.  One big question-mark over Nike has been whether it will be hit in its biggest growth market, China, by a backlash against American-branded goods in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric and successive rounds of import tariffs.  Instead, Nike\u2019s sales there grew 22% year-on-year, extending a run of double-digit growth that goes back five years. Analysts from another major brokerage, Credit Suisse, said China would be a source of growth for many years to come and Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion indicated the company was not experiencing any fallout with Chinese consumers.  \u201cNike\u2019s digital business grew over 70% in China in the first quarter,\u201d Credit Suisse analysts said. \u201cAnd we\u2019d note that this outsized digital growth was without the benefit of the Nike App launch.\u201d  Campion said the company would be launching the App in its second quarter ending in November, earlier than previously planned.

The footwear maker\u2019s shares fell about 4% in after-hours trading.  The wholesale business, through which Nike sells merchandise to other retailers, came to a halt amid the health crisis. That led to a 50% fall in shipments, increased inventory and higher costs due to order cancellations.  As a result, gross margin fell 820 basis points in the fourth quarter, when company-owned stores and other retailers were closed for nearly eight weeks.  However, Nike\u2019s investments in its digital platform over the years helped it record a 75% rise in online sales, as many consumers shopped for activewear and sneakers from the comfort of their homes.  Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe told analysts the company is now accelerating focus on its online presence, and expects its overall business to reach 50% digital penetration. Online sales accounted for 30% of total revenue in the quarter.  \u201cCOVID-19 has shown that our strategy is sound,\u201d Donahoe said.

President Donald Trump also tweeted, without providing evidence, that \u201cNike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts\u201d.  But the research by Thomson Reuters, conducted in collaboration with StyleSage Co, showed here the world's largest sportswear maker sold out far more items between Sept. 3 and Sept. 13 than in the 10-day period before the ad came out.  Nike discounted fewer products in the 10-day period after the ad and saw its Colin Kaepernick women\u2019s jersey sell out on Sept. 17, the research also showed.  \u201cThese strong statistics reinforce the notion that Nike is standing firm \u2013 and not just in a social context,\u201d said Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research at Thomson Reuters.  \u201cThey don\u2019t need to participate in the discounting that tends to plague other retail brands.\u201d  Thomson Reuters is the parent company of Reuters News.

FILE PHOTO: Athletics - Dubai Marathon - Dubai, United Arab Emirates - January 24, 2020 General view of an athlete wearing the Nike Vaporfly shoes REUTERS\/Christopher Pike\/File Photo  The first-ever shoe ban by World Athletics (WA), the sport\u2019s governing body, addresses concerns that technology advances are giving athletes an unfair and unnatural advantage. It limits future use of carbon fibre plates and some track spikes but stopped short of outlawing the Vaporfly models that have helped re-write the record books for elites and amateurs alike.  Prototype variants of the Vaporfly used by Eliud Kipchoge to run the first sub-two hour marathon and by fellow Kenyan Brigid Kosgei to smash the women\u2019s marathon world record were both reported to contain triple carbon plates inside thick, ultra-compressed foam, said by Nike to help improve running economy by up to four percent. Those have been banned and from April 30 any future version, of any shoe, must have been available to the general public for four months before being allowed in elite competition. That will put paid to the use by Nike and others of prototypes by their athletes in major races.  Nike Inc NKE.N unleashed the Vaporfly in 2016 and various versions have quickly come to dominate the elite and \"serious recreational\" side of road running. The distinctive pink and green footwear, which cost around $250 and have a lifespan of only around 200 miles, is now widespread throughout the fields of every major race.  Kipchoge and other leading athletes have welcomed the shoes as a natural technological advance, but others say they have gone too far, with Yannis Pitsiladis, a professor of sport and exercise science at Britain\u2019s Brighton University, calling them \u201ctechnological doping\u201d.  \u201cIt is not our job to regulate the entire sports shoe market but it is our duty to preserve the integrity of elite competition by ensuring that the shoes worn by elite athletes in competition do not offer any unfair assistance or advantage,\u201d WA President Sebastian Coe said in a statement on Friday.  World Athletics said any records set under the previous rules will stand.  \u201cWe can draw a line by prohibiting the use of shoes that go further than what is currently on the market,\u201d Coe said. \u201cI believe these new rules strike the right balance by offering certainty to athletes and manufacturers as they prepare for Tokyo 2020, while addressing the concerns that have been raised about shoe technology.\u201d  The new rules state that road shoes must have soles no thicker than 40mm and not contain more than one rigid, embedded plate.  The controversy could provide a boost for athletic equipment maker Nike, burnishing the Vaporfly\u2019s reputation among amateurs not affected by the ruling.  \u201cIf anything this probably brings more excitement around the product,\u201d Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. \u201cOver two-thirds of footwear that is bought, is bought for fashion purposes.\u201d  WA will establish an expert working group to guide future research into shoe technology and to assess new shoes that emerge on the market.  Nike did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment on the decision.  \u2018SECRET WEAPON\u2019  Marathon superstar Kipchoge has been the Vaporfly\u2019s flagbearer, wearing them to set a world record, win the 2016 Olympic title and then, in an advanced version not available to the public, go under two hours in an unofficial marathon.  Kosgei ran 2:14.04 in last year\u2019s Chicago Marathon, taking 81 seconds off Briton Paula Radcliffe\u2019s 16-year-old women\u2019s marathon world record and making her almost three minutes faster than any other woman in history.  Vaporflys have featured in several other records in the last three years and athletes wearing them took 31 of the 36 top-three finishes in the Marathon Majors series last year.  Nike says the shoes have \u201ca built-in secret weapon that provides a propulsive sensation\u201d.  Other manufacturers have also released, or are developing, their own carbon-insoled shoes, but WA\u2019s ruling would now appear to have put the brakes on.  WA\u2019s action echoes that of swimming\u2019 s governing body, which a decade ago banned Speedo\u2019s record-smashing LZR speed suit.  Kosgei, however, was unmoved when asked by Reuters about the ban. \u201cThe shoes did not have legs to run, it is the power and energy of an athlete,\u201d she said. \u201cNot every athlete who wore the shoes ran a world record.\u201d","159":"Nike and Converse on Tuesday sued to shut down 589 websites and 676 social media accounts that allegedly traffic in counterfeit versions of the companies\u2019 apparel and accessories, including the Nike Air Jordan and Flymax shoes and the Converse \u201cChucks\u201d favored by Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris.

It is Nike\u2019s latest plan to keep shoppers coming back to its brands as it struggles with strong competition from Adidas in its U.S. home market and a resurgence in retro brands like Fila and Reebok.  With three tiers of subscription \u2013 $20, $30 or $50 a month \u2013 Nike Adventure Club is aimed at 2-year to 10-year olds and effectively gives subscribers a new pair of Nike sneakers that cost about $50 or more once a month, once every two months or once every three.  Depending on whether the kids pick, for example, Nike Air Max or Converse sneakers, members will save almost nothing or up to $50 on each pair.  \u201cSolving the need for parents with kids aged 2-10 years means that we are going to start building relationships through kids,\u201d the scheme\u2019s manager for Nike, Dave Cobban, said.  The big challenge, he admitted, was helping parents get the right shoe for kids with constantly growing feet without trips to the mall or a series of mailed returns.  Nike\u2019s subscription box will include a sizing chart in the form of a fridge magnet to help parents measure their children\u2019s feet. The company said a pilot program with 10,000 members has shown that only a small proportion of parents get the size wrong.  \u201cAbout 15% of the first order is generally not the right size. When the (customer) makes the first order and it\u2019s the wrong size, we allow (the customer) to immediately order a new shoe and the new shoe comes before you have to send back the old one,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe next time less than 5% make a mistake in ordering the right size on their second order and after that, it almost comes (down) to zero.\u201d  Walmart Inc and Macy\u2019s are already using the subscription model for beauty products to keep consumers interested in a market that is flooded by online specialty retailers and Amazon.com Inc.","172":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas ADSGn.DE cut its 2018 revenue forecast on Wednesday after third quarter sales fell in western Europe, where it was hit by changing fashions and Nike's NKE.N gains in soccer.  While the German sportswear firm has been taking market share in North America, its U.S. rival has been powering ahead in Europe, helped by a strong showing by Nike-sponsored teams at the soccer World Cup and its Phantom range launch.  Adidas shares, which have gained 12 percent in the last year, were down 2.3 percent by 0954 GMT after it cut its 2018 target for currency-neutral sales growth to between 8 to 9 percent from \u201caround 10 percent\u201d.  Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted has focused on improving profitability at Adidas since he took over in 2016, by focusing on growing in North America and Asia and pushing ecommerce, where margins are higher than in stores.  Adidas said it now expects 2018 net income from continuing operations to grow 16 to 20 percent, compared with previous guidance of 13 to 17 percent.  After an earlier warning that western European sale were likely to be flat in the second half, Adidas said the region\u2019s currency-adjusted sales fell 1 percent in the third quarter.  Rorsted said Adidas had relied too much on shoes like its retro Stan Smith and Superstar that have fallen out of fashion, and not enough on sports performance gear.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cWe are a sports company. We should have done a better job in the sports channel,\u201d he told journalists.  NOT FAST ENOUGH  Adidas had also failed to react quickly enough to demand for its new styles like Continental shoes, and had overpriced some goods, all factors it is now addressing, Rorsted added.  Adidas continued to grow fast elsewhere, with sales up 16 percent in North America and by 15 percent in Asia-Pacific.  Ecommerce sales jumped 76 percent in the quarter and Adidas saw the September launch of Yeezy Boost shoes designed by rapper Kanye West drive traffic to its website, with sales and margins of the new styles above its expectations.  Overall, Adidas said its third-quarter sales rose by a currency-adjusted 8 percent to 5.873 billion euros ($6.75 billion), shy of analysts\u2019 average forecasts, while net profit from continuing operations jumped 19 percent to 656 million euros, beating consensus.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  In a 2-1 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Jacobus Rentmeester did not show that Nike misappropriated his 1984 photo of Jordan, which had been used in a Life magazine feature on that year\u2019s Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.  The Jordan brand now generates $3.1 billion of annual revenue for Nike, which is based in Beaverton, Oregon.  Rentmeester\u2019s photo depicted Jordan, then a student at the University of North Carolina, airborne in a grassy knoll featuring a basketball hoop as a prop, with his left arm extended upward and a basketball in hand.  Several months later, Nike commissioned a similarly posed photo but used Chicago\u2019s skyline as background, because Jordan was then playing for the National Basketball Association\u2019s Chicago Bulls. Nike used that photo to market Air Jordan sneakers, and in 1987 to create the Jumpman logo.  Circuit Judge Paul Watford wrote that while both photos \u201ccapture Michael Jordan in a leaping pose inspired by ballet\u2019s grand jet\u00e9,\u201d they were not \u201csubstantially similar\u201d because of differences in setting, lighting and other elements.  Watford said this meant the logo was also acceptable, and added that Jordan\u2019s pose by itself could not be copyrighted.  \u201cCopyright promotes the progress of science and the useful arts by encouraging others to build freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by a work,\u201d Watford wrote. \u201cThat is all Nike\u2019s photographer did here.\u201d  A lawyer for Rentmeester did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nike had no immediate comment.  Rentmeester, a former Olympic rower from the Netherlands, had sued in January 2015 for copyright infringement damages for the prior three years, avoiding issues with his 30-year delay.  Circuit Judge John Owens dissented from Tuesday\u2019s decision, calling dismissal of the copyright claim premature.  \u201cWhether the Nike photo is substantially similar is not an uncontested breakaway layup,\u201d he wrote.  The decision upheld a June 2015 ruling by now-Chief Judge Michael Mosman of the federal district court in Portland, Oregon.  Jordan, 55, is principal owner of the NBA\u2019s Charlotte Hornets.

Amateur runners can still run in these shoes.\u201d  The running world is waiting for word from governing body World Athletics, which for months has been examining what to do about the high-tech footwear, used by Kenyan runners Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei in stunning performances last year.  Among the options facing the organization are to impose a wholesale ban on the shoes or take more limited measures to deal with their carbon plate and foam sole technology.  Debate has raged among athletes and commentators about whether the shoes should be allowed and if a ban could be implemented effectively beyond heavily monitored elite racing.  Kipchoge, who wore Vaporflys when he ran the first sub-two-hour marathon in Vienna last October, told the Telegraph on Wednesday that wearing the shoes was \u201cfair\u201d and that the sport should embrace such technological advances.  Nike, the world\u2019s largest athletic apparel company, says on its website that the shoe, which retails at around $250, has \u201ca built-in secret weapon\u201d. It did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

Attorney Michael Avenatti speaks to the media outside United States Court in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., July 23, 2019. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  In a Wednesday night court filing, Avenatti blamed the office of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan for having \u201ceschewed the typically careful and thoughtful fact-gathering investigation on which it historically prides itself\u201d in its \u201czest to nab\u201d him.  Avenatti also said Trump and his family \u201chave demonstrated genuine animus\u201d toward him and that it was clear he would not have been prosecuted if not for that animus.  A spokesman for Berman declined to comment on Thursday. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Avenatti, 48, became famous last year representing porn star Stormy Daniels, who said she had sex with Trump, in lawsuits involving the president and his now-imprisoned former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Trump has denied Daniels\u2019 claim.  In March, Avenatti was accused of trying to extort more than $20 million from Nike by threatening to expose what he called its improper payments to recruits for college basketball teams it sponsored.  Prosecutors said Avenatti agreed to back off only if the athletic wear company would pay $1.5 million to his whistleblower client, basketball coach Gary Franklin, and up to $25 million for him and the lawyer Mark Geragos to conduct a investigation.  Nike has denied wrongdoing. Geragos has not been charged.  Avenatti said his demands, made in obscenity-laden communications recorded at prosecutors\u2019 behest after Nike approached them, were merely part of settlement negotiations and reflected his \u201czealous advocacy\u201d for Franklin.  He said none of that seemed to matter to prosecutors who let his \u201caggressive\u201d public persona, \u201clong feud\u201d with Trump and brief involvement in Cohen\u2019s prosecution color their actions.  \u201cIf Mr. Avenatti were attorney Doe - or Mr. Geragos, for that matter - he would not have been arrested or charged,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s filing said.  Prosecutors in Manhattan also have charged Avenatti with stealing about $300,000 from Daniels after helping her secure a book contract, to fund his extravagant lifestyle.  Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, claimed to have received hush money not to discuss her alleged affair with Trump in 2006.  Avenatti also faces charges in California of wire fraud, bank fraud and other crimes, including for defrauding other clients.  He has pleaded not guilty to the various charges and could face more than 400 years in prison if convicted.  The case is U.S. v.

Nike has worked with Ronaldo since 2003 and in 2016 announced a lifetime deal with him worth which could be worth as much as $1 billion, according to Forbes magazine.  Electronic Arts has featured Ronaldo on the cover of its EA Sports\u2019 FIFA series for two years.  \u201cWe have seen the concerning report that details allegations against Cristiano Ronaldo,\u201d an EA spokesperson said in an email to Reuters.  \u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation, as we expect cover athletes and ambassadors to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with EA\u2019s values,\u201d the company said.

Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in,\u201d the world-famous athlete wrote in a tweet to his 75 million followers.  Ronaldo transferred from soccer team Real Madrid to Italian champions Juventus this summer for 100 million euros. Juventus broke their silence on the situation Wednesday afternoon on Twitter, fully backing Ronaldo.  \u201cCristiano Ronaldo has shown in recent months his great professionalism and dedication, which is appreciated by everyone at Juventus,\u201d the team tweeted.  \u201cThe events allegedly dating back to almost 10 years ago do not change this opinion, which is shared by anyone who has come into contact with this great champion,\u201d Juventus said.","188":"Jan 28 (Reuters) - Nike Inc\u2019s Kobe Bryant merchandise was sold out on its website, the company said on Tuesday, following reports the company had pulled products branded by the NBA star who died in a helicopter crash on Sunday.

EU enforcers said the royalty payments appeared higher than those which independent companies would have agreed between themselves, and may have unduly reduced the Dutch entities\u2019 taxable base and given Nike a selective advantage amounting to illegal state aid.  The Commission\u2019s preliminary assessment that state aid is involved contained legal errors, Nike said in its arguments, according to a filing on the Luxembourg-based General Court\u2019s website.  EU regulators also failed to provide \u201csufficient reasons for finding that the contested measures fulfil all elements of state aid, especially why they should be regarded as selective\u201d, the company said.  The sportswear company also faulted the Commission for rushing to open a formal investigation \u201cwhere there were no difficulties to continue the preliminary investigation.\u201d  The Commission has a mixed record in its campaign against unfair tax deals, with Apple winning its legal fight against a 13 billion euro Irish tax order and Starbucks against a 30 million euro Dutch tax order.

William 'Bill' Ackman, CEO and Portfolio Manager of Pershing Square Capital Management, speaks during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The billionaire investor\u2019s hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management earned roughly $100 million in profit when it cashed out of its 0.71 percent stake in the sportswear company recently, a person familiar with the move said on Thursday.  Two months ago, the activist investor told clients that Pershing Square had taken a rare passive stake in Nike at the end of 2017, when the stock was trading at around $53 a share and that the bet had already earned them a roughly 30 percent gain.  Ackman, a passionate tennis player, is often photographed on courts wearing Nike apparel ranging from shoes to shirts to wrist bands.  The Wall Street Journal first reported the hedge fund\u2019s exit from the Dow component.  The quick gains on Nike will be welcome news for Ackman's investors who have watched him post losses for three consecutive years when long-held investments on Valeant VRX.TO and against Herbalife HLF.N weighed on returns. He exited Valeant last year and got out of Herbalife earlier this year.  In January, Ackman told his investors that he was making changes to return the prominent firm to its glory days by shrinking his team, becoming more involved in the investment process again and leaving the marketing to someone else.. The firm generated compound returns of 21 per cent a year net of fees over 11 years from its launch to the end of 2014. Then it lost money in 2015, 2016, and 2017.  So far, he has largely stuck to his plans to keep a lower profile. There was no big announcement that he had exited Herbalife and there was not much fanfare around the Nike investment either.  Still, Ackman\u2019s private hedge funds are again in the red for 2018, nursing losses of roughly 3.7 percent as the broader stock market, as measured by the S&P 500, is roughly flat for the year.  Pershing Square, which traditionally makes investments where it seeks to make changes in the board room, has left Nike at roughly the same time the company is grappling with issues surrounding its culture. There have been complaints about workplace behavior and Trevor Edwards, an executive who had been seen as a possible successor to the CEO, is leaving.  Nike is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings after markets close on Thursday.","193":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday accused China of curtailing \u201crights and liberties\u201d in Hong Kong and blasted U.S. company Nike and the National Basketball Association for falling in line with Beijing in a disagreement over free speech.  In a major policy speech on China that touched on an array of disputes ahead of talks with Beijing to ease a trade war, Pence said the United States does not seek confrontation or to \u201cde-couple\u201d from its main economic rival.  But he pulled no punches when addressing some of the political rifts between the two countries.  Criticizing China\u2019s construction of a \u201csurveillance state,\u201d and \u201cincreasingly provocative\u201d military action, Pence held up Taiwan\u2019s Democracy as a better path for Chinese people and took Beijing to task for its handling of pro-democracy protests that have rocked Hong Kong for more than four months.  \u201cHong Kong is a living example of what can happen when China embraces liberty,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet, for the last few years, Beijing has increased its interventions in Hong Kong and engaged in actions that curtail the rights and liberties that Hong Kong\u2019s people were guaranteed through a binding international agreement.\u201d  He said the United States stands with the protesters in Hong Kong, millions of whom have taken to the streets in sometimes violent clashes over what they see as China\u2019s tightening grip.  \u201cWe stand with you, we are inspired by you. We urge you to stay on the path of non-violent protest,\u201d Pence said in his address at a Washington think tank.  He also slammed China for its treatment of Muslim Uighurs in the Xinjiang region.  Pence directed some of his harshest words at sports apparel giant Nike NKE.N and the NBA, which he accused of siding with China's Communist Party over freedom of speech in Hong Kong.  The vice president, who is often the face of the Trump administration\u2019s tougher policies on China, said the NBA and Nike had failed to defend basketball team Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, after he tweeted support of Hong Kong protesters earlier this month.  \u201cSome of the NBA\u2019s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,\u201d he said.  By \u201csiding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,\u201d Pence said.  Nike stores in China removed Rockets merchandise after Beijing criticized Morey, Pence noted.  \u201cNike promotes itself as a so-called social-justice champion, but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,\u201d he said.  Pence said \u201cfar too many American multinational corporations have kowtowed to the lure of China\u2019s money and markets by muzzling not only criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, but even affirmative expressions of American values.\u201d  Nike, the NBA and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the remarks.  Influential Chinese state-backed newspaper the Global Times, however, said in an editorial that while Pence reiterated many of his previous criticisms, there was still \u201croom for optimism.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: U.S. Vice President Mike Pence attends a news conference at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, October 17, 2019. REUTERS\/Huseyin Aldemir\/File Photo  \u201cHe emphasized the U.S. does not want to \u2018decouple\u2019 and repeated how U.S. President Donald Trump is willing to start a new future with China,\u201d it said.  TRADE TALKS  The closely watched speech set a discordant tone just weeks before a summit in Chile where U.S. President Donald Trump hopes to finalize a partial trade deal with China\u2019s Xi Jinping.  The S&P 500 U.S. stock index briefly moved lower after his comments.  Analysts said Pence\u2019s speech appeared aimed at keeping the way open for a trade deal while seeking to convince Trump\u2019s support base that he was tough on China going into the 2020 election.  Douglas Paal, a China expert with Washington\u2019s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called it \u201ca superficial and political speech, not a guiding strategic document.\u201d  Scott Kennedy, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, saw it as an bid to provide rationale for \u201cpolicy moves on security, economics and politics which originally were much less coordinated and less integrated.\u201d  A new round of talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese officials to try to end the bruising trade dispute is set for Friday.  The United States launched a trade war with China 15 months ago, alleging unfair trading practices such as theft of U.S. intellectual property and generous industrial subsidies at the expense of foreign competitors.  Fears of antagonizing Beijing had prompted the White House to postpone Pence\u2019s speech, which was originally scheduled for June, ahead of a meeting Trump and Xi aimed at getting trade talks back on track.  Many China watchers had expected Pence to tread lightly on sensitive topics on Thursday, in sharp contrast to the bombastic tone of his first major China policy address a year ago. But some saw signs of a rapprochement as well.  \u201cIn contrast to the Hudson Institute speech of October 2018, the Vice President\u2019s equally hard-hitting Wilson speech offered the beginnings of a positive vision for U.S.-China relations,\u201d said Robert Daly of the Kissinger Institute on China.  Pence said the United States was \u201cnot seeking to contain China\u2019s development.\u201d \u201cWe want a constructive relationship with China\u2019s leaders,\u201d he said, calling on Beijing to \u201cseize this unique moment in history to start anew by ending the trade practices that have taken advantage of the American people for far too long.\u201d","194":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission has opened an investigation into the tax treatment of Nike Inc NKE.N in the Netherlands, saying this may have given the U.S. sportswear maker an illegal advantage.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Nike case, announced on Thursday, follows other probes by the EU executive since 2013 into tax schemes in Belgium, Gibraltar, Luxembourg, Ireland and the Netherlands it says allow companies to establish structures to reduce their taxes unfairly.  The countries have been ordered to recover the tax from beneficiaries of such schemes, which have included Amazon AMZN.O, Apple AAPL.O, Starbucks SBOX.O and Fiat FCHA.MI.  The Commission said in a statement that Dutch authorities had issued five tax rulings from 2006 to 2015, two of which are still in force, endorsing a method to calculate the royalty payments to two Nike entities based in the Netherlands.  The EU executive, which oversees competition policy in the 28-member European Union, said that, at this stage, it was concerned that the royalty payments endorsed by the rulings \u201cmay not reflect economic reality\u201d.  \u201cMember states should not allow companies to set up complex structures that unduly reduce their taxable profits and give them an unfair advantage over competitors,\u201d EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.  Nike said it was subject to and ensured that it complied with all the same tax laws as other companies operating in the Netherlands.  \u201cWe believe the European Commission\u2019s investigation is without merit,\u201d a Nike spokesperson said.  The Dutch finance ministry said it would cooperate with the Commission\u2019s investigation and said that it agreed tax rulings should provide certainty and not preferential treatment.  The Commission has pushed governments to tighten taxation rules in response to revelations in the so-called LuxLeaks and the Panama and Paradise Papers, but some countries have resisted EU-wide changes.  Vestager did say she welcomed actions taken by the Netherlands to reform its corporate taxation rules and to help to ensure that companies operate on a level playing field.  The Commission said its new investigation concerned the tax treatment of two Nike companies based in the Netherlands - Nike European Operations Netherlands BV and Converse Netherlands BV - which market and record sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  They received licenses to use intellectual property rights of Nike and Converse products in the region in return for tax-deductible royalty payments to two other Nike entities also based in the Netherlands, but not taxable there.  The Commission said the royalty payments appeared higher than what independent companies would have agreed between themselves. As a result the Netherlands may have allowed the Nike companies to pay a lower amount of tax. If this was confirmed, it would amount to illegal state aid.  The Commission will allow the Netherlands and interested parties to submit comments.  The Commission is also conducting an in-depth investigation into Dutch tax rulings in favor of IKEA and an investigation into a tax scheme for multinationals in Britain.","195":"FILE PHOTO: A customer is reflected in a shop window decorated with Nike store logo at the outlet village Belaya Dacha outside Moscow, Russia, April 23, 2016.

Nike, which said the expansion is expected to generate more than 500 full-time jobs, made no mention of the loss of the $1 million incentive in its statement on the new facility.  Nike responded to a request for comment with a referral to its statement announcing the new plant.  Last week, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, withdrew the incentive for Nike to build the plant after the world\u2019s largest sportswear maker canceled the release of a sneaker featuring a colonial-era version of the American flag, which critics say reflects links to slavery.

However, the German sportswear brand, which is also the official sponsor of the tournament, expects only a limited financial impact, partly because this year\u2019s World Cup takes place in Russia, where the economy is in the doldrums.  \u201cThe World Cup in Russia does carry lower financial opportunities than the similar event four years ago in Brazil,\u201d Adidas Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said earlier this month.  \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re looking forward to it. It\u2019s going to be a fantastic way of bringing our brand to life globally,\u201d Rorsted added.  Since the last tournament in 2014, Adidas has grown sales rapidly in areas other than soccer, capitalizing on booming demand for its retro basketball sneakers and springy Boost running shoes to outpace Nike, particularly in the U.S. market.  Nevertheless, soccer remains important for the image of the German brand, which has supplied the World Cup match ball since 1970 and has a deal to sponsor the event until 2030.  It also announced last week it will extend its partnership with the UEFA Champions League until 2021.  After Nike kitted out more teams for the first time in Brazil in 2014, Adidas has fought back, this year sponsoring 12 of the 32 participating teams, including strong contenders like Germany and Spain, along with hosts Russia.  Nike, which only got heavily involved in soccer when the World Cup was played in the United States in 1994, is supplying shirts for 10 countries, including Brazil, France and England.

(For graphic on kit manufacturers throughout World Cup tournaments, click tmsnrt.rs\/2JiAK6W)  NO IRANIANS WEAR NIKE  While team deals are important for sales of soccer jerseys, more critical for sales of boots is the sponsorship of top players, particularly the likes of Portugal\u2019s Cristiano Ronaldo, who wears Nike, and Argentina\u2019s Lionel Messi, in Adidas.  Nike expects 60 percent of all the players heading to Russia will be wearing its boots, including almost half the German and Spanish team and three-quarters of the Russians, even though they will be wearing Adidas shirts.  An exception is Iran, which faces new sanctions after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal. Nike says none of the country\u2019s players are wearing its shoes, while Adidas is providing the team\u2019s jerseys.  A Nike spokesman said: \u201cThis has no relation to any political situation.\u201d  German brand Puma PUMG.DE is a distant third, sponsoring just four relatively lowly teams in the competition, compared with the eight it kitted out in 2014, dented by the failure of its top team Italy to qualify.  Still, Puma Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden says the World Cup has helped its order book for the second and third quarters.  Adidas reported soccer-related sales of 2.1 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in 2014, when it sold 14 million official match balls and 8 million jerseys, including 3 million for the winning German team.  Sales rose to 2.5 billion euros by 2016, but slipped as a proportion of total Adidas revenue to 13.5 percent from 14.5 percent in 2014. It has not disclosed figures since then.  Nike saw soccer sales fall a currency-adjusted 4 percent to $2 billion for its fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, accounting for less than 6 percent of group revenue.  The World Cup could add about 3 to 4 percentage points to Adidas group revenue growth in 2018, lower than previous tournaments due to the fact it is happening in Russia, according to Piral Dadhania, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.  However, Dadhania noted much of the benefit occurs before the event as the jerseys have already been sold to retailers.  \u201cAny incremental boost during or after the event relating to jersey sales depends on the extent to which specific teams progress through the competition,\u201d Dadhania said.","208":"March 15 (Reuters) - Nike Inc:  * NIKE, INC.

The Women\u2019s World Cup will be held from June 7 to July 7.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing incredible momentum in women\u2019s sports right now,\u201d Nike official Amy Montagne told Reuters ahead of the launch. \u201cWe see this as the next chapter to support, celebrate and elevate female athletes.\u201d  The company declined to give financial terms of the deal with European governing body UEFA, or the value of the individual national kit sponsorship deals.  Both, however, are the latest sign of the growing financial power of women\u2019s sport for sports goods makers like Nike, Adidas and Under Armour.  In the second quarter of the 2019 financial year, women\u2019s footwear and apparel alone counted for nearly a quarter of Nike\u2019s total revenue and it has said the women\u2019s footwear and apparel market is now 1.5 times bigger than that for men.  Wall Street brokerage Bernstein calculates women\u2019s sporting gear pulled in $7 billion for Nike last year.  As a part of the partnership with UEFA, Nike will supply the match ball for exclusive use in women\u2019s competitions including the Women\u2019s Champions League, Women\u2019s Euro and junior tournaments.  Nadine Kessler, UEFA\u2019s head of women\u2019s football said the partnership across competitions and campaigns sends \u201ca powerful message that the game is now being judged and supported on its own merits, it underlines also its important milestones beyond the field of play.\u201d  Nike\u2019s announcement of a partnership with UEFA comes three months after Visa signed a seven-year deal with European soccer\u2019s governing body to sponsor the women\u2019s game at all levels.  It also comes at a time when UEFA plans to increase its funding for women\u2019s soccer development projects across Europe by 50 percent from 2020.  Global governing body FIFA, which has made women\u2019s football a top priority, last year said it would look to double the number of female players to 60 million by 2026.  It also said it would raise the prize money for this year\u2019s World Cup from $15 million to $30 million.  Nike said it would also invest at the grassroots level to encourage more female athletes.  \u201cWe believe this summer can be another turning point for the growth of women\u2019s football,\u201d Nike\u2019s chief executive Mark Parker said in a statement.","210":"A federal appeals court has revived a lawsuit by a former Nike Inc employee who claims he suffered severe and pervasive harassment because of his Croatian national origin.

With malls and department stores like J.C. Penney shutting shops due to COVID-19 lockdowns, people turned to e-commerce, buying significantly more products directly from Nike\u2019s website. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Nike reported a 75% rise in online sales and Wall Street analysts expect this to continue - at least nine have raised their price targets on the stock in the last two weeks.  E-commerce sales are now nearly a third of Nike\u2019s total revenue \u2013 a goal Nike had previously set for 2023. Nike\u2019s first-quarter adjusted sales in China are also expected to have grown by more than 10% as official lockdowns there all but ended.  Particularly in North America, sales in the global athletic footwear and apparel industry have picked up, and Nike will get a boost from the new back-to-school dynamic, said Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia.  Portland, Oregon-based Nike is expected to post a net profit of $729 million in the most recent quarter, versus a loss of $790 million in the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv.  To save costs and target investment online this year, the company said in July it would cut corporate jobs starting Oct. 1 and end nine major retail contracts, including deals with department store Dillard\u2019s and Amazon.com-owned shoe retailer Zappos. Nike in July scrapped plans to open a major shoe plant in Arizona in favor of investments elsewhere.  The company has invested this year in marketing itself as a supporter of high-profile social and political movements like Black Lives Matter and Time to Vote, and launched a new maternity line and several inclusive ad campaigns.","212":"(Reuters) - U.S. footwear companies, including Nike Inc and Under Armour, on Monday urged U.S. President Donald Trump to remove footwear from the proposed tariffs list on goods imported from China.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \"The proposed additional tariff of 25 percent on footwear would be catastrophic for our consumers, our companies, and the American economy as a whole,\" a group of 173 companies said in a letter here.  Trump increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% from 10% earlier this month, a move that is expected to raise prices on thousands of products including clothing, furniture and electronics  Trump is expected to impose 25% tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping next month.  \u201cAs an industry that faces a $3 billion duty bill every year, we can assure you that any increase in the cost of importing shoes has a direct impact on the American footwear consumer,\u201d the companies said.  The letter was also sent to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow.  The Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America (FDRA) estimates the hike in tariff would add $7 billion in additional costs for customers every year.  The companies noted that the tariffs on footwear average 11.3% and reach rates as high as 67.5%. Adding a 25% tax increase on top of these tariffs would mean Americans could pay a nearly 100% duty on their shoes, the companies said in the letter.  Last week, the world\u2019s largest retailer Walmart Inc warned that its prices would increase due to higher tariffs on goods from China and that the levies were already hurting its furniture business.  Macy\u2019s also said that the tariffs enacted on May 10, does have some impact, particularly on its furniture business.","213":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas reported strong second-quarter results on Thursday, as its sales growth outpaced rival Nike in North America where new styles are proving popular even as the German sportswear brand stagnated in western Europe.  Shares in the company famous for its three-stripe brand soared more than 10 percent to a four-month high, putting them on track for their best day since the group increased its financial guidance in March.  The results are the latest endorsement of a strategy pursued by Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted since taking over in 2016, focused on improving profitability as well as expanding in North America and China and pushing sales via ecommerce.  Some investors feared that Adidas would struggle as the popularity of its retro Stan Smith and Superstar shoes waned in the last 18 months. Promoted by singer Pharrell Williams, the Superstar was the top selling shoe in the U.S. market in 2016.  But Rorsted says Adidas has managed the fashion cycle carefully, trying not to oversupply old styles, while stepping up promotion for new lines like its springy \u201cUltra Boost\u201d running shoes and the \u201cParley\u201d made out of recycled ocean plastic.  The 1980s \u201cContinental\u201d leather sneakers that were relaunched in June are already selling out, Rorsted said, and a broadening of a partnership with rapper Kanye West is planned, after earlier designs were made only in very limited quantities.  Tighter control of supply helped Adidas sell more shoes at full prices in the quarter, helping to counteract higher marketing spending due to the soccer World Cup.

REUTERS\/Joe Penney\/File Photo  GRAPHIC: World Cup kit manufacturers tmsnrt.rs\/2JiAK6W  WESTERN EUROPE LAGS  However, Rorsted admitted that the company failed to focus enough on the launch of new products in western Europe, prompting management changes in the region. Sales were likely to stay flat in the region in the second half of the year, he said.  While Adidas has been taking market share from Nike in North America, the U.S. firm has been powering ahead in Europe, Middle East and Africa, with sales up 10 percent in its March to May fiscal fourth quarter.  Group sales rose 10 percent to 5.26 billion euros ($6 billion) after currency effects, beating the 8 percent expected by analysts, while attributable net profit of 396 million was also ahead of the average forecast for 386 million.  Adidas saw sales growth in North America slow slightly to 16 percent, but that was still well ahead of the 3 percent growth Nike reported for March to May.  In greater China, Adidas sales growth accelerated to 27 percent, slightly ahead of Nike\u2019s 25 percent, and they jumped 14 percent in Russia, which hosted the World Cup.  Nike teams dominated the final rounds of the World Cup, but Rorsted said the tournament was still a success as Adidas sold more than 8 million shirts and more than 10 million balls, and saw a boost to downloads of its app, advertised in stadiums.  Adidas said it was taking an impairment of 475 million euros related to the Reebok trademark in 2016, but it said the restatement had no impact on its cash position and reiterated its guidance for 2018 and beyond.  Adidas bought the Reebok brand in 2005, but it has performed poorly since. Rorsted has given Reebok until 2020 to return to profitability and said it should be helped by a new partnership with British designer Victoria Beckham.  He noted that Reebok sales in North America rose 6 percent despite many store closures and it narrowed its losses.","214":"Boxes of Nike shoes are pictured in the warehouse of local footwear retailer \"Pomp It Up\" in Bussigny near Lausanne, Switzerland 24 Aprill, 2019.

But the brand recognition that comes with the campaign may be just what the company wanted, and marketing experts predicted it would ultimately succeed.  The ad revived a raging debate in the United States that started in 2016 when Kaepernick, then with the San Francisco 49ers, began kneeling to protest multiple police shootings of unarmed black men.  \u201cThis is right on the money for Nike. They stand for this irreverent, rebellious attitude. In this case, it\u2019s reinforcing the brand,\u201d said Erich Joachimsthaler, CEO of strategy consulting firm Vivaldi.  While some fans praised Kaepernick and other players who joined him in kneeling as patriotic dissenters, critics led by U.S. President Donald Trump blasted the protesters as ungrateful and disrespectful.  Trump called Nike\u2019s campaign \u201ca terrible decision\u201d in an interview with the Daily Caller published on Tuesday, but he also showed some respect for Kaepernick\u2019s right to speak out.  \u201cAs much as I disagree with the Colin Kaepernick endorsement, in another way \u2014 I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have done it. In another way, it is what this country is all about, that you have certain freedoms to do things that other people think you shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Trump said.  The NFL, which gave in to pressure from Trump and ordered players not to kneel on the field during the anthem, nonetheless praised Kaepernick.  \u201cThe social justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised deserve our attention and action,\u201d said Jocelyn Moore, the NFL\u2019s executive vice president of communications and public affairs.  In the immediate backlash against the campaign, announced on Monday, Nike shares fell nearly 4 percent at one point on Tuesday and closed down 3.2 percent.  Calls for a boycott fed social media buzz about the campaign. There were 2.7 million mentions of Nike over the previous 24 hours, the social media analysis firm Talkwalker said at midday, an increase of 135 percent over the previous week.  After his protests, Kaepernick could not find a job for the 2017 season and sued the National Football League, accusing owners of colluding to blackball him. He is still without a team.  Nike has sponsored Kaepernick since 2011 and said he will be one of several faces for a campaign marking the 30th anniversary of its \u201cJust Do It\u201d slogan.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The ad refers to Kaepernick\u2019s loss of NFL income with the quote: \u201cBelieve in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.\u201d  Some who were offended by the choice posted social media pictures of Nike shoes they had set on fire or socks with the Nike swoosh cut out.  Twitter user Sean Clancy, or @sclancy79, posted a picture of a pair of Nike trainers on fire on Tuesday that was retweeted 20,000 times.Athletes including Serena Williams, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Chris Paul showed support.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The controversy may have been a convenient excuse for some investors to sell an over-valued stock, Vivaldi\u2019s Joachimsthaler said.  Christopher Svezia, a footwear and apparel analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc., said Nike shares were trading at roughly 30 times next year\u2019s forecast earnings, compared with 24 percent for rival Adidas.  \u201cNike more than anyone else really knows who their customer is,\u201d Svezia said, describing them as largely 14- to 22-year-old males.  Matt Powell, a senior adviser with market research firm NPD Group, predicted the boycott would fizzle. \u201cOld angry white guys are not a core demographic for Nike,\u201d he said.  Barry Lowenthal, CEO of The Media Kitchen, praised the campaign and said Nike has long proven successful in using celebrity endorsements to promote its brand, a precursor to what is known as influencer marking in the social media age.  \u201cThese kind of endorsement deals were the first version of influencer marketing. Of course they know it works. It\u2019s classic product placement,\u201d Lowenthal said.  Even former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad weighed in, tweeting: \u201cThe #NFL season will start this week, unfortunately once again @Kaepernick7 is not on a NFL roster.\u201d"}}
