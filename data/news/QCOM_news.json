NECESSARY Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","1":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday won a major victory in its wide-ranging legal dispute with Apple Inc as the companies reached a surprise settlement that called for the iPhone to once again use Qualcomm modem chips.  Shares of Qualcomm jumped 23 percent to $70.45 in regular trading, their biggest gain in more than 19 years, then hit $75.25 in after-hours trading.  Intel Corp, which had been Apple\u2019s sole iPhone chip supplier for the past year amid intensifying conflict with Qualcomm, said hours after the settlement was announced that it would exit the modem chip business.  The Qualcomm settlement also incorporates a six-year patent license and a payment from Apple to Qualcomm, but the companies did not disclose the amount.  Because Qualcomm is already shipping 5G chips while Intel was still developing them, the deal helps Apple in its battle with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other manufacturers whose phones already work on the faster networks.  \u201cThis is a big win\u201d for Qualcomm, said Christopher Rolland, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group.  The settlement followed two years of increasingly bitter legal battles between the two companies and came as opening arguments took place at a trial in federal court in San Diego.  Intel said Tuesday it was exiting the phone modem business and would focus its 5G efforts on other devices such as networking gear.  Shares of Intel were up 2.7 percent at $58.25 in after hours trade. Apple was barely changed after hours.  \u201cIntel isn\u2019t trading lower because modems represent such a small portion of revenues for the company,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy.  The deal could help Qualcomm return to the preeminent position it held in the early 2010s when it dominated the transition to 4G mobile networks and expanded revenues dramatically.  Apple had accused Qualcomm of using illegal patent practices to keep a monopoly on modem chips that connect phones to mobile data networks. Qualcomm had said Apple was using its technology without paying for it.  Qualcomm and Apple did not say when their new supply agreement would start. Because Intel does not expect to have a 5G chip ready for phones until next year, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said Apple is most likely tapping Qualcomm for its 5G chip.

REUTERS\/Fabrizio Bensch\/File Photo  Intel\u2019s exit from the modem business does not necessarily mean Qualcomm will become Apple\u2019s sole supplier. Apple executives testified in January at a trial between the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Qualcomm that Apple\u2019s policy is always seek several suppliers.  Moreover, during the FTC trial Apple executives disclosed they had held talks with Samsung and MediaTek Inc about possibly using their 5G modems for 2019 iPhones.  Apple this year also moved its modem engineering efforts into the same group that makes its proprietary chips, signaling that the iPhone maker is also seriously pursuing its own modem.  BOOST TO EARNINGS  Qualcomm said the arrangements are expected to generate $2 per share in additional earnings, though analysts cautioned it was not clear how much of that was coming from the license deal versus the supply agreement.  Analysts were also unsure whether Apple\u2019s a onetime payment under the deal represented unpaid royalties from the past two years or a down payment on future royalties.  The settlement could also have an impact on China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, which is also in a licensing dispute with Qualcomm. Analysts widely believe that Huawei was watching the outcome of the Apple case to gauge its bargaining position.  Finally, the U.S. FTC case against Qualcomm that makes many of the same claims of anticompetitive behavior remains unresolved, with a decision expected at any time.  A jury of six men and three women was in the process of hearing opening arguments from Apple and Qualcomm when news of the settlement broke.  In addition to the federal lawsuit, the companies had lodged litigation in dozens of jurisdictions around the world, including Qualcomm efforts to ban iPhone sales in Germany and China and a state court case in San Diego where Qualcomm accused Apple of helping steal its chip secrets to benefit Intel.  Apple filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm in January 2017, accusing the chipmaker of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.  Later Qualcomm hit back with its own lawsuit, alleging that Apple used its heft in the electronics business to wrongly order contract factories such as Hon Hai Precision Co Ltd\u2019s Foxconn to withhold royalty payments from Qualcomm that Apple had historically reimbursed to the factories.  As part of the settlement, Qualcomm will also end litigation with Apple\u2019s contract manufacturers.  Intel did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.","2":"(Adds Boeing, Rite Aid Corp, Bombardier; Updates Broadcom, Telecom Italia)  Feb 21 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2045 GMT on Wednesday:  ** Microchip maker Broadcom Ltd cut its bid for Qualcomm Inc by 4 percent to $117 billion as it objected to Qualcomm\u2019s decision to raise its own bid for NXP Semiconductors NV to $44 billion.  ** Bombardier should be \u201con alert\u201d for merger opportunities that will enable its transportation unit to compete with larger rivals in an industry that is consolidating to help reduce costs, the chief executive of its biggest independent shareholder said.  ** U.S. grocer Albertsons Cos Inc said it would buy drug store chain Rite Aid Corp to create a company with $83 billion in annual revenue, giving it more clout to compete with bigger chains in an industry fearing the entry of Amazon.Com .  ** Boeing Co sees a \u201cgreat strategic fit\u201d in a possible acquisition of Brazilian plane maker Embraer SA but the deal is not essential, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said.  ** Italy\u2019s competition watchdog has extended a probe into Telecom Italia to see whether the former state telephone monopoly hindered new rival Open Fiber\u2019s efforts to roll out an ultrafast broadband network.  ** Temenos agreed to a 1.4 billion pound ($1.96 billion) takeover of British software peer Fidessa Group on Wednesday, whose shares traded above the offer price after activist investor Elliott Capital Advisors disclosed a stake.  ** Thai oil and gas company PTT Pcl said it would increase its stake in oil refiner IRPC Pcl, purchasing all the shares held by state-run lender Government Savings Bank for 13.85 billion baht ($439.26 million).  ** South Korean cosmetics and pharmaceuticals contract manufacturer Korea Kolmar Co beat out private equity firms for a deal to buy domestic health foods and drugmaker CJ HealthCare for $1.2 billion, sending its shares soaring.  ** China Hanking Holdings Ltd launched a takeover bid for Australia\u2019s Primary Gold Ltd in line with a plan to build a long-term Australian gold business, valuing the target firm at A$37.5 million ($29.6 million).  ** French telecoms group Orange has no plans to merge with a rival in Germany or expand in another country in Africa, Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard said.  ** U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co, already one of the leaders in the hot area of cancer immunotherapy, said it had agreed to buy Viralytics for 502 million Australian dollars ($394 million) to expand its pipeline in the sector.  ** Germany\u2019s Robert Bosch said it has acquired a carpooling start-up in the United States and created a new digital unit to further its expansion into data-based mobility services.  ** Dutch energy firm Eneco Group said it would buy from Uniper SE all E.ON branded sales and supply activities in the Benelux, representing about 200,000 retail and business customers.","3":"March 5 (Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd:  * BROADCOM REITERATES QUALCOMM DID NOT INFORM ITS OWN STOCKHOLDERS OR BROADCOM OF ITS SECRET, VOLUNTARY UNILATERAL REQUEST FILED ON JANUARY 29, 2018  * BROADCOM SAYS ITS ONLY CORRESPONDENCE WITH CFIUS \u201cWAS IN RESPONSE TO CFIUS INQUIRIES ABOUT BROADCOM\u2019S NOMINATION OF DIRECTORS TO THE QUALCOMM BOARD\u201d Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","4":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc illegally suppressed competition in the market for smartphone chips by threatening to cut off supplies and extracting excessive licensing fees, a U.S. judge ruled, a decision that could force the company to overhaul its business practices.

Other courts in FTC enforcement actions have held that compliance reporting requirements are not \u2018unduly burdensome,\u2019 even when the provisions require reporting for a period of twenty years.\u201d  ** \u201cQualcomm may not interfere with the ability of any customer to communicate with a government agency about a potential law enforcement or regulatory matter.\u201d  ** \u201cThe evidence demonstrates that Qualcomm\u2019s anticompetitive conduct is ongoing and that an injunction is thus warranted.\u201d  ** \u201cQualcomm continues to refuse to provide patent exhaustion, refuse to sell modem chips to an OEM until the OEM signs a license, and engage in chip supply threats and cutoffs. Steve Mollenkopf (Qualcomm CEO) conceded at trial that Qualcomm does not sell chips to unlicensed OEMs.\u201d  ** \u201cQualcomm\u2019s exclusive dealing agreements have foreclosed Qualcomm\u2019s rivals from a substantial share of the CDMA and premium LTE modem chip markets.\u201d  ** \u201cTo permit Qualcomm to continue to charge unreasonably high royalty rates would perpetuate its artificial surcharge on rivals\u2019 chips, which harms rivals, OEMs, and consumers, and would enable Qualcomm to continue to reap the fruits of its Sherman Act violation. Thus, the court finds it necessary to require Qualcomm to renegotiate those license agreements.\u201d  ** \u201cQualcomm\u2019s own documents show that Qualcomm knew its licensing practices could lead to antitrust liability, knew its licensing practices violate FRAND, and knew its licensing practices harm competition, yet continued anyway \u2014 even in the face of government investigations in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, the European Union, and the United States.  This evidence of Qualcomm\u2019s intent confirms the court\u2019s conclusion that Qualcomm\u2019s practices cause anticompetitive harm because \u2018no monopolist monopolizes unconscious of what he is doing\u2019.\u201d  ** \u201cIn addition, even though Intel is supplying modem chips to Apple, Aicha Evans (Intel Chief Strategy Officer) testified that Intel has never met its target margins and that Intel\u2019s sales of modem chips to Apple have not yet been profitable.  When asked about the probable effect of losing Apple\u2019s business in any given year, Evans testified that losing Apple\u2019s business \u2018would not be near death, that would be death\u2019.\u201d  ** Cristiano Amon (Qualcomm President) not only approved the plan for QCT to cut off chip supply to Chinese OEMs who refuse to pay patent royalties to QTL, but Amon agreed to start communicating this plan to customers.  \u201cDespite Amon\u2019s own handwriting acknowledging 2015 chip supply threats, Amon testified under oath at his deposition and trial that he was unaware of QTL threats to cutoff chip supply.\u201d  ** \u201cChina\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission investigated Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices and in 2015 imposed a rectification plan that altered some of Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices in China.  Presentation notes from a slide deck that Boston Consulting Group presented to the Qualcomm board of directors in 2015 explain that Qualcomm was able to avoid caps on non-SEP royalty rates, more aggressive rate cuts, and forced sales to non-licensees due to a $150 million payment to the Chinese government.\u201d","5":"SHANGHAI\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc, facing a court ban in China on some of its iPhone models over alleged infringement of Qualcomm Inc patents, said on Friday it will push software updates to users in a bid to resolve potential issues.  FILE PHOTO : An attendee uses a new iPhone X during a presentation for the media in Beijing, China October 31, 2017. REUTERS\/Thomas Peter  Apple will carry out the software updates at the start of next week \u201cto address any possible concern about our compliance with the order\u201d, the firm said in a statement sent to Reuters.  Earlier this week, Qualcomm said a Chinese court had ordered a ban on sales of some older iPhone models for violating two of its patents, though intellectual property lawyers said the ban would likely take time to enforce.  \u201cBased on the iPhone models we offer today in China, we believe we are in compliance,\u201d Apple said.  \u201cEarly next week we will deliver a software update for iPhone users in China addressing the minor functionality of the two patents at issue in the case.\u201d  In a statement, Qualcomm\u2019s general counsel Don Rosenberg said \u201cApple continues to disregard and violate the Fuzhou court\u2019s orders\u201d despite the planned software changes.  \u201cThey are legally obligated to immediately cease sales, offers for sale and importation of the devices identified in the orders and to prove compliance in court,\u201d he said in the statement.  The case, brought by Qualcomm, is part of a global patent dispute between the two U.S. companies that includes dozens of lawsuits. It creates uncertainty over Apple\u2019s business in one of its biggest markets at a time when concerns over waning demand for new iPhones are battering its shares.  Qualcomm has said the Fuzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court in China found Apple infringed two patents held by the chipmaker and ordered an immediate ban on sales of older iPhone models, from the 6S through the X.  Apple has filed a request for reconsideration with the court, a copy of which Qualcomm shared with Reuters.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  WHERE\u2019S THE HARM?  Qualcomm and Apple disagree about whether the court order means iPhone sales must be halted.  The court\u2019s preliminary injunction, which the chipmaker also shared with Reuters, orders an immediate block, though lawyers say Apple could take steps to stall the process.  All iPhone models were available for purchase on Apple\u2019s China website on Friday.  Qualcomm, the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, filed its case against Apple in China in late 2017, saying the iPhone maker infringed patents on features related to resizing photographs and managing apps on a touch screen.  Apple argues the injunction should be lifted as continuing to sell iPhones does not constitute \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Qualcomm, a key consideration for a preliminary injunction, the copy of its reconsideration request dated Dec. 10 shows.  \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why in a very complicated patent litigation case the judge would be reluctant to grant a preliminary injunction,\u201d said Yiqiang Li, a patent lawyer at Faegre Baker Daniels.  HIT LOCAL SUPPLIERS  Apple\u2019s reconsideration request also says any ban on iPhone sales would impact its Chinese suppliers and consumers as well as the tax revenue it pays to authorities.  The request adds the injunction could force Apple to settle with Qualcomm. But it was not clear whether this referred to the latest case or their broader legal dispute.  Qualcomm has paid a 300 million yuan ($43.54 million) bond to cover potential damages to Apple from a sales ban and Apple is willing to pay a \u201ccounter security\u201d of double that to get the ban lifted, the copy of the reconsideration request shows.  Apple did not immediately respond to questions about the reconsideration request and Reuters was not independently able to confirm its authenticity.  Yiqiang Li said the case would undoubtedly ramp up pressure on Apple, especially if a ban was enforced.  \u201cI think that Qualcomm and Apple, they always have those IP litigations to try to force the other side to make concessions. They try to get their inch somewhere. That\u2019s always the game.\u201d","6":"(Reuters) - Former Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O Chairman Paul Jacobs has informed its board of directors that he will seek to partner with investment firms to make an offer for the U.S. semiconductor company, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Jacobs' attempt to put together an offer comes just a few days after Qualcomm fended off a $117 billion hostile bid from Singapore-based rival Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O thanks to an order by U.S. President Donald Trump prohibiting the deal due to national security concerns.  Qualcomm does not view Jacobs' attempt to put together a buyout bid as credible, the sources said. Jacobs has held talks with several investment firms, including SoftBank Group Corp's 9984.T Vision Fund, but has so far been unable to secure the necessary financing, the three sources added.  Jacobs is attempting to put together the largest leveraged buyout of all time, three times as large as the $45 billion buyout of Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings, which ended in bankruptcy.  Even if SoftBank, a Japanese telecommunications group with technology investments around the world, wanted to join Jacobs\u2019 bid, it could face conflicts given its ownership of British chip designer ARM Holdings Plc, the sources said. Adding to the potential conflicts, Qualcomm is an investor in the Vision Fund.  SoftBank\u2019s deals are also subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the U.S. national security panel that also objected to Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm.  The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Qualcomm declined to comment, while Jacobs and SoftBank could not be immediately reached for comment. The Financial Times first reported on Jacob\u2019s buyout efforts earlier on Thursday.  Jacobs, who still sits on Qualcomm\u2019s board, was stripped of his title of executive chairman earlier this month when Jeffrey Henderson, another Qualcomm director, was named non-executive chairman.  While Jacobs shared the view of Qualcomm\u2019s board that Broadcom\u2019s bid undervalued the company and was fraught with regulatory risks, many on Qualcomm\u2019s board blamed him for the dissatisfaction of some Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders with the company\u2019s handling of Broadcom\u2019s bid, according to the sources.  Jacobs, whose father Irwin co-founded Qualcomm, is up for re-election as board director, alongside other Qualcomm nominees, at the company\u2019s shareholder meeting on March 23. Proxy advisory firm ISS on Wednesday recommended to Qualcomm shareholders that they vote for Broadcom\u2019s four nominees on Qualcomm\u2019s 11-person board, even though their nominations have been withdrawn, as a form of protest.  Given that Qualcomm\u2019s board director slate faces no competition, the re-election of Qualcomm\u2019s board directors is assured. However, limited support for Qualcomm\u2019s nominees could put pressure on Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf, who was criticized by some investors for inviting CFIUS to review Broadcom\u2019s bid, to make changes to the company\u2019s strategy.","7":"FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is pictured in front of one of its many buildings in San Diego, California November 5, 2014.

San Diego-based chip supplier Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O on Wednesday announced a new effort to try to make developing robots easier. The company has combined its processor chips and software in partnerships with dozens of companies that make sensors and other key robotics elements to create what it calls its RB5 development kit.  Better known for supplying mobile phone processors to most Android devices, Qualcomm has been working on robotics chips for four years. Its chips are found in some of iRobot Corp's IRBT.O vacuums.  With the RB5 chips and tools, Qualcomm aims to do the foundational work of weaving together bits and pieces of robotics systems. This means makers of drones and robots can spend more time working on the function of the machine, such as performing work in warehouses or factories, said Dev Singh, senior director of business development and head of autonomous robotics, drones and intelligent machines.  The Qualcomm system, for example, works with depth-sensing cameras from Intel Corp INTC.O and motion sensors and motor control hardware from TDK Corp 6762.T.  \u201cWe understand the pain points,\u201d Singh said in an interview.

The acquisition has been caught in the crosshairs of rising U.S.-China trade tensions, with sources saying an approval would depend on the progress of broader bilateral talks. The deal has got a nod from eight of the nine required global regulators, with Chinese clearance the only one pending.  Qualcomm is likely to meet Chinese regulators before U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross arrives in China on Saturday, the sources briefed on Qualcomm\u2019s discussions said.  A Qualcomm team and officials from the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) met in Beijing on Friday and had \u201cproductive\u201d talks, the sources said.  The San Diego-based firm is now \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d the deal will go forward, one of the sources said, amid recent indications of a thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions that has seen both sides propose tens of billions of dollars in tariffs.  On Friday, the Trump administration said it had reached a deal that would put ZTE Corp back in business after the Chinese telecommunications company pays a $1.3 billion fine and makes management changes.  Resolving the ZTE sales ban has been of chief importance to China\u2019s leadership. The firm was banned in April from buying U.S. technology components for seven years after breaking an agreement it reached for violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea.  \u201cIt feels as though it\u2019s getting close to the end,\u201d said the source quoted above.  NEW SUBMISSION  Qualcomm is now preparing a new submission to SAMR aimed at providing final guarantees and assurances, the sources said.  China\u2019s market regulator did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment outside of business hours.  While there are no explicit ties between ZTE\u2019s problems, Sino-U.S. trade tensions and Qualcomm-NXP merger clearance, there are \u201cperceived linkages\u201d and the timing of current discussions is \u201cnot coincidental\u201d, two of the sources said.  \u201cThe degree to which the two sides are moving to resolve trade tensions clearly has an impact,\u201d one source said.  Qualcomm in recent weeks has moved to restart discussions that have stalled since the end of last year.  The company in April was forced to refile its China anti-trust application to clear the NXP deal, after talks reached a dead end.  Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm\u2019s president, was in China last week, attending a big data industry expo in the southwest province of Guizhou.  Earlier this month, China\u2019s anti-trust regulator approved Qualcomm\u2019s investment with a unit of state-owned Datang Telecom Technology Co. to design, package and test smartphone chipsets, one year after the joint venture was announced.

In the past, Apple used Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips in its flagship iPhone models to help them connect to wireless data networks. But early last year, Apple sued Qualcomm in federal court in San Diego, alleging that the chip company\u2019s practice of taking a cut of the selling price of phones as a patent license fee was illegal.  Qualcomm denied the claims and has alleged that Apple owes it $7 billion in unpaid royalties.  The case is to go to trial early next year and has spawned related legal actions in other courts around the world. In July, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, told investors on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call that the two companies were in talks to resolve the litigation.  \u201cWe continue to talk. We also have a number of ... legal strategies that are in flight,\u201d Mollenkopf said on the call. \u201cAnd we hope that through the combination of either those paths, we could get to a resolution, and we\u2019re confident that we will.\u201d  But a source familiar with the situation said this week that there are no settlement talks between Apple and Qualcomm.  \u201cThere is absolutely no meaningful discussion taking place between us and Qualcomm, and there is no settlement in sight,\u201d the person said. \u201cWe are gearing up for trial.\u201d  In addition to its dispute with Apple, Qualcomm is in a dispute with another phone maker, widely believed by analysts to be China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, that is withholding payments. But talks with Huawei appear to be progressing.  In July, Qualcomm received what its patent licensing chief, Alex Rogers, called a \u201cgood faith partial payment\u201d of $500 million from the non-paying phone maker, which Qualcomm executives said was a sign of progress in the talks. Qualcomm is slated to receive $200 million more in such payments, the executives have said.  Qualcomm is also trying to settle an antitrust lawsuit brought against it by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission days before Apple filed its lawsuit.  But that effort suffered a setback on Tuesday, when a federal judge in San Jose, California, issued a preliminary ruling saying that Qualcomm must license some patents involved in making modem chips to rivals such as Intel Corp, a move that could jeopardize Qualcomm\u2019s existing licensing practices.

Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest smartphone-chip maker, walked away from its agreement to buy NXP in July, after failing to secure Chinese regulatory approval. The planned deal was first agreed between the two companies in October 2016.  Qualcomm, headquartered in San Diego, California, and NXP, based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, needed China\u2019s blessing for their deal because of their presence in that country.  After high-stakes talks on Saturday between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Argentina, the White House said in a statement that China was \u201copen to approving the previously unapproved\u201d deal for Qualcomm to acquire NXP \u201cshould it again be presented\u201d.  But Qualcomm said there was no prospect for the acquisition to be revived.  \u201cWhile we were grateful to learn of President Trump and President Xi\u2019s comments about Qualcomm\u2019s previously proposed acquisition of NXP, the deadline for that transaction has expired, which terminated the contemplated deal,\u201d a Qualcomm representative said via email.  \u201cQualcomm considers the matter closed.\u201d  NXP declined to comment.  On Monday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters that President Trump put the issue of the acquisition on the table in the talks with the Chinese president.  Kudlow added that the Chinese president\u2019s openness to the deal was a sign of further cooperation on multiple issues, including corporate mergers. Xi\u2019s reported comment could embolden some potential acquirers in the semiconductor space to explore transactions, corporate dealmakers said.  \u201cAlthough that acquisition cannot be resuscitated, Xi\u2019s comment reveals in plain sight that Chinese antitrust policy is inherently politicized,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in a blog post.  FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen, as chip maker Broadcom Ltd announced an unsolicited bid to buy peer Qualcomm Inc for $103 billion, in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Qualcomm shares closed up 1.5 percent at $59.14 in New York on Monday, while NXP shares ended up 2.75 percent at $85.67.  Qualcomm and NXP did not lobby for the Trump administration to bring up the abandoned deal in its meeting with Xi and other Chinese officials on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires on Saturday, which was dominated by negotiations over trade tariffs, according to sources close to the companies.  The two companies were surprised to see that the terminated deal resurfaced as an issue, the sources added, requesting anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. Qualcomm was given just an hour\u2019s notice by the Trump administration about Xi\u2019s comment on the NXP deal, and its inclusion in the White House statement, according to two of the sources.  The Trump administration had unsuccessfully lobbied the Chinese government earlier this year to give its blessing to the deal.  China\u2019s foreign ministry declined to comment on Qualcomm during a regular media briefing on Monday.  Qualcomm had sought to purchase NXP because of its market position as a dominant supplier to the automotive market, as car makers add more chips to vehicles each year. Qualcomm is now focused on developing its own chips for the automotive market, according to one of the sources.  Qualcomm had to pay NXP a $2 billion fee to terminate the deal. To appease its shareholders, Qualcomm has also embarked on a $30 billion stock repurchase plan to return to them most of the money that would have been used for the NXP deal. It has spent more than $20 billion in share buybacks in the last 12 months. NXP has also announced its own $5 billion share buyback program.  DEALS ABANDONED  Several deals by semiconductor companies were put on ice after the Qualcomm\/NXP deal fell through, simply because they had a footprint in China and required regulatory approval there. Now, chip companies may be more optimistic about their regulatory chances in China.  One example could be Xilinx Inc XLNX.O, a U.S. provider of chips used in communications network gear and consumer electronics that has a big presence in China. Xilinx is currently vying to acquire Israeli chip maker Mellanox Technologies Ltd MLNX.O after it decided to run an auction to sell itself, according to people familiar with the matter. A successful acquisition of Mellanox could prove an important test of China's appetite to approve such deals. A representative for Xilinx declined to comment. Mellanox did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  A more near-term test being watched by dealmakers is KLA-Tencor Corp KLAC.O pending acquisition of fellow semiconductor equipment maker, Israel's Orbotech Ltd ORBK.O. The $3.4 billion deal, announced in March, is still awaiting Chinese regulatory approval. KLA-Tencor's CEO said on the company's last earnings call that he expects the deal to close by year end.  Thus far, other high-profile mergers and acquisitions involving U.S. companies in other sectors have received Chinese approval. Last month, China approved United Technologies Corp's UTX.N $30 billion purchase of aircraft parts maker Rockwell Collins Inc and Walt Disney Co's DIS.N $71.3 billion deal to buy most of Twenty-First Century Fox\u2019s FOXA.O entertainment assets.  Acquisitions of U.S. companies by Chinese companies, on the other hand, have been few and far between in the last year, after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a government panel that scrutinizes deals for potential national security risks, shot down more of these deals, such as Ant Financial\u2019s plan to acquire U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc MGI.O. U.S. lawmakers also passed reforms earlier this year that increased CFIUS' scrutiny of deals.","15":"(Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge has issued a preliminary ruling that Qualcomm Inc owes Apple Inc nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebate payments, though the decision is unlikely to result in Qualcomm writing a check to Apple because of other developments in the dispute.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Judge Gonzalo Curiel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on Thursday ruled that Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, was obligated to pay nearly $1 billion in rebate payments to Apple, which for years used Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips to connect iPhones to wireless data networks.  The payments were part of a business cooperation agreement between the two companies amid the peculiar patent licensing practices of the consumer electronics industry.  In general, the contract factories that built Apple\u2019s iPhones would pay Qualcomm billions of dollars per year for the use of Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology in iPhones, a cost that Apple would reimburse the contract factories for. Separately, Qualcomm and Apple had a cooperation agreement under which Qualcomm would pay Apple a rebate on the iPhone patent payments if Apple agreed not to attack in court or with regulators.  In a lawsuit filed two years ago, Apple sued Qualcomm, alleging that the chip supplier had broken the cooperation agreement by not paying nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebates.  Qualcomm in turn alleged that it stopped paying the rebate payments because Apple had broken the agreement by urging other smartphone makers to complain to regulators and making \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d statements to the Korean Fair Trade Commission, which was investigating Qualcomm over antitrust allegations. Apple responded that it was making lawful responses to regulators in an ongoing investigation.  Judge Curiel sided with Apple, ruling that Qualcomm owed the missed rebate payments.  \u201cQualcomm\u2019s illegal business practices are harming Apple and the entire industry,\u201d Apple said in a statement.  Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, told Reuters in a statement, \u201cAlthough the Court today did not view Apple\u2019s conduct as a breach of Apple\u2019s promises to Qualcomm in the 2013 Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement, the exposure of Apple\u2019s role in these events is a welcome development.\u201d  The decision will not become final until after the trial in the case, which begins next month. And it is unlikely that Qualcomm will make a new payment to Apple.  Apple\u2019s contract factories, which under normal circumstances would pay Qualcomm for patent royalties owed on iPhones, have already withheld the nearly $1 billion in payments to Qualcomm. Qualcomm\u2019s Rosenberg said those withheld iPhone payments have already been accounted for in Qualcomm\u2019s existing financial statements.  \u201cApple has already offset the payment at issue under the agreement against royalties that were owed to Qualcomm,\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s Rosenberg told Reuters.","16":"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds betting Qualcomm QCOM.O would succeed in a $44 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NXPI.O face steep losses after the deal fell through - taking the shine off a strong start to the year for many funds.  Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, called off the deal on Thursday after the Chinese regulator failed to approve it by a Wednesday deadline.  Many funds bought into NXP months ago at an average of around $115 a share, well below the $127.5 a share offer price, a trader at a major investment bank told Reuters, but rising U.S. China trade tensions caused a steady slide in the value of the target.  After closing at $98.37 on Wednesday, ahead of the deadline, shares in NXP were down more than 7 percent early on Thursday. From Wednesday\u2019s close to Thursday, the estimated paper loss based on the share price movement would be more than $700 million, based on available Thomson Reuters data.  \u201cIt\u2019s a significant hit but it\u2019s always more palatable for risk-arbitrage to lose money as a slow bleed,\u201d said the trader at the bank. \u201cThe struggle is when you come in and the stock is down 30 percent in one day.\u201d  Which funds held what position at when the deal was called off on Wednesday is hard to determine as U.S. securities filings data has a long lag. It is also impossible to show using publicly available data when they bought and sold, to determine precise losses.  The most recent Thomson Reuters data, however, showed hedge funds made up seven of the top 10 shareholders in NXP, and collectively they held more than 35 percent of its shares.  \u201cA lot of hedge funds are involved in NXP-Qualcomm. We have about five to 10 event-driven managers involved in the trade,\u201d said Ben Watson, senior investment manager, alternatives at Aberdeen Standard Investments.  Three of the seven hedge funds among the top-10 investors cut exposure to NXP ahead of Wednesday, including Soroban Capital Partners, Och-Ziff Capital Management and Pentwater Capital Management, Thomson Reuters data showed.  All of these funds declined to comment to Reuters.  \u201cWe cut our position from near-10 percent of our portfolio in February down to under 5 percent,\u201d said a trader at one of the top-30 hedge funds with a position in NXP.  The losses marred what has been an otherwise strong start to the year for \u2018event-driven\u2019 funds that specialize in trading around deals.

Also, a number of other China-U.S. deals had successfully completed or were expected to complete which has helped performance, investors said.  Among them were Marvell Technology MRVL.O, which announced it had acquired Cavium on July 6, and Microchip Technology MCHP.O, whose takeover of Microsemi Corp was finalised May 29.  Investors and analysts also pointed to reasons for funds not to sell out of NXP completely.  As a result of cancelling the deal, Qualcomm paid a $2 billion breakup fee to NXP - a fact that should help bolster the share price - while NXP also launched a share buy-back. Olivetree analysts suggested NXP could now hit a standalone price of $120 a share.","17":"(Corrects translated word in Chinese foreign ministry quote as \u201cindustry\u201d, not \u201cproduction\u201d)  * Offer expires on Wednesday  * China only regulator yet to approve deal  * Sources close to Qualcomm say approval looks unlikely  * China though could make last-minute move - source  * Not approving deal may escalate trade tensions  By Michael Martina and Greg Roumeliotis  BEIJING\/NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc is yet to win China\u2019s nod to buy Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors even as a deadline for the offer to expire is just hours away, raising the prospect the deal could be scuppered amid Sino-U.S. trade tensions.  The $44 billion deal was announced in October 2016, just days before the election of U.S. President Donald Trump and has since become embroiled in a whipsawing trade standoff between two countries who are at loggerheads over trade tariffs and have clashed on issues such as ownership of technology and patents.  Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, and NXP said in April they would call off the deal if they were unable to win Chinese regulatory approval by July 25, 2359 eastern U.S. time. China was the only hold out from eight of the nine global regulators required to approve the deal.  If the deal collapses, it is likely to aggravate tensions between Washington and Beijing, as the two sides look to avoid tensions spiralling into a fully-blown trade war.  It will leave Qualcomm on the hook for a $2 billion breakup fee and searching for new ways to expand beyond chips for the mobile phone market, where growth has slowed.  A source close to the company said it was coming up against a \u201cstone wall\u201d in dealings with China\u2019s anti-trust regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and that there had been no recent progress with them on the deal.  But the source added that it was still a toss-up whether the deal would be approved at the last minute.  A second source close to Qualcomm told Reuters it looks unlikely that approval from China would come on Wednesday and the company is making preparations to pay NXP the fee.  Qualcomm did not respond to requests for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.  The regulator could not be reached for comment.  China\u2019s foreign ministry, responding to a question, said on Wednesday that relevant departments were reviewing the deal and had maintained \u201cgood communication\u201d with Qualcomm through the review process.  \u201cQualcomm\u2019s takeover deal with NXP will have a far reaching effect on the global semiconductor industry,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular news briefing.  The Chinese foreign ministry has no purview over the review, but is the only government department with a daily briefing that foreign media can attend.  CHINA HOPES  Qualcomm needs Chinese approval because the country accounted for nearly two-thirds of its global revenue last year.  Hopes for the deal rose in May after the White House said it reached a deal to lift a supplier ban on Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE Corp. A Qualcomm team met with Chinese officials around the same time in Beijing and had \u201cproductive\u201d talks, sources briefed on the matter then said.  Sources in the U.S. business community told Reuters on Wednesday that if the Qualcomm deal falls through it could be considered a serious escalation of the trade war by the White House and would damage China\u2019s image as an antitrust regulator.  \u201cIt would not be good for China. It will show how obviously distorted its antitrust regime is,\u201d a third source said.  Trump has played an outsized role in Qualcomm\u2019s fate.  In March, he issued an order blocking Broadcom Inc\u2019s $117 billion hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm on concerns that the deal would weaken its position in so-called 5G mobile technology, allowing China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to become the dominant player.  Shortly after that, Trump began the process of imposing tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods. So far, he has imposed tariffs on $34 billion of these and threatened to levy tariffs on over $500 billion of Chinese exports.  China has retaliated with tariffs on $34 billion worth of U.S. goods.  Since China imports far less from the United States than vice versa, there are fears that China would find alternative ways to strike back - including blocking deals by U.S. companies.

FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is shown outside one of the company's many buildings in San Diego, California, U.S., September 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The deal marks a big push by Qualcomm to reestablish a leading position in chip performance after several years of high-profile patent licensing litigation with rival Apple and regulatory authorities.  It also comes amid a change in the helm with Qualcomm announcing this month that Cristiano Amon, its current president and head of its silicon division, will replace outgoing CEO Steven Mollenkopf, effective June 30.  Founded by three of Apple\u2019s former top semiconductor executives in charge of iPhone chips, Nuvia has been working on a custom CPU core design that it had said would be used in server chips.  Qualcomm, however, plans a broad use of Nuvia\u2019s processors, saying they would power flagship smartphones, next-generation laptops, infotainment systems and driver-assistance systems among other applications.  While laptop makers have traditionally turned to Intel Corp for processors, Qualcomm has been supplying PC chips for several years to firms such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Microsoft Corp.  \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see Nuvia join the Qualcomm team,\u201d Panos Panay, Microsoft\u2019s chief product officer, said in a statement on the deal. \u201cMoving forward, we have an incredible opportunity to empower our customers across the Windows ecosystem.\u201d  The deal is also significant because it could help lessen Qualcomm\u2019s reliance on Arm Ltd, which is being purchased by Qualcomm rival Nvidia Corp for $40 billion.  Most of Qualcomm\u2019s current chips use computing cores licensed directly from Arm, while Nuvia\u2019s cores use Arm\u2019s underlying architecture but are custom designs. For Qualcomm, using more custom core designs - a move that Apple has also made - could lower some licensing costs to Arm in the short term and make it easier to move to a rival architecture in the longer term.  While Qualcomm and Apple have resolved disputes over Qualcomm\u2019s patent royalties, Nuvia and Apple have been at loggerheads.  In 2019, Apple sued Nuvia\u2019s Chief Executive Gerard Williams III, alleging Williams recruited Apple employees to Nuvia while he was still employed at Apple. Apple did not sue Nuvia itself, nor did it allege any intellectual property theft, and no trial date has been set.","20":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O on Friday said former executive chairman Paul Jacobs would not be renominated for the U.S. semiconductor company's board after Jacobs disclosed his intention to pursue a long-shot acquisition of the firm.  FILE PHOTO: Paul Jacobs, Executive Chairman of Qualcomm attends the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland January 20, 2017. REUTERS\/Ruben Sprich\/File Photo  Jacobs, the former chief executive of the world\u2019s largest mobile chipmaker and the son of its co-founder, said in a separate statement that it was \u201cunfortunate and disappointing\u201d that his fellow board members were \u201cattempting to remove me from the board at this time.\u201d  The board decision comes just days after U.S. President Donald Trump blocked a $117 billion hostile bid from Singapore-based rival Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O to acquire Qualcomm, citing national security concerns.  Jacobs supported Qualcomm\u2019s resistance to Broadcom\u2019s bid, but he increasingly clashed with other members of the San Diego-based company\u2019s board, including Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf, over how Qualcomm defended itself, according to people familiar with the matter.  Qualcomm said in a statement that its board of directors met on Friday and decided that Jacobs would not be nominated for re-election at its annual meeting on March 23, and that the board would shrink to 10 members from 11.  The company did not give specific reasons for the decision but said it wanted to stay independent and continue with its business plans. Mollenkopf has outlined a plan to cut more than $1 billion in costs and boost profits to more than $7 per share by 2019 by resolving disputes with customers such as Apple AAPL.O.  In his statement, Jacobs said he believed that Qualcomm could strengthen itself in the global chip business by going private.  \u201cThere are clear merits to exploring a path to take the company private in order to maximize the company\u2019s long-term performance, deliver superior value to all stockholders, and bolster a critical contributor to American technology,\u201d Jacobs said.  Jacobs' attempt this week to put together an offer to acquire Qualcomm by reaching out to investment firms including SoftBank Group Corp's 9984.T Vision Fund was a result of his disaffection, the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.  Qualcomm shares rose less than 1 percent to $61.15 in after hours trading following the decision on Friday, giving the company a market capitalization of around $90 billion.  Without an existing company as acquirer, Jacobs is attempting to put together the largest leveraged buyout of all time, three times as large as the 2007 $45 billion buyout of Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings, which ended in bankruptcy.  Jacobs holds about 1.3 million shares of Qualcomm, less than 0.1 percent of outstanding shares, according to Qualcomm\u2019s security filings.  Even if SoftBank, a Japanese telecommunications group with technology investments around the world, wanted to join Jacobs\u2019 bid, it could face conflicts given its ownership of British chip designer ARM Holdings Plc, sources said on Thursday.  Given that Qualcomm\u2019s board director slate faces no competition, the re-election of Qualcomm\u2019s nominees is assured. However, limited support for Qualcomm\u2019s directors could put pressure on Mollenkopf.","21":"Feb 14 (Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd:  * QUALCOMM ISSUES STATEMENT ON MEETING WITH BROADCOM  * QUALCOMM INC - \u201cWE MET WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF BROADCOM FOR TWO HOURS EARLIER TODAY, AND LISTENED CAREFULLY TO WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY\u201d  * QUALCOMM INC - QUALCOMM BOARD WILL \u201cPROMPTLY MEET TO DISCUSS MEETING AND TO DETERMINE NEXT STEPS\u201d  * QUALCOMM - ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER ITS BOARD, SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM MET TODAY WITH BROADCOM TO DISCUSS BROADCOM\u2019S PROPOSAL Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","22":"Feb 21 (Reuters) - Broadcom Corp has lowered its takeover offer for chipmaker Qualcomm Inc to $79 per share from $82 to account for the latter\u2019s increased offer for NXP Semiconductors NV, Broadcom said on Wednesday.

(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham)","23":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O forecast fiscal first-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday as it predicted sales of 5G smart phones would balloon to more than half a billion units next year, powered in part by new Apple Inc AAPL.O iPhone 12 models.  FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is shown outside one of the company's many buildings in San Diego, California, U.S., September 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Qualcomm\u2019s shares were up 14% in extended trading.  The San Diego-based company is the biggest supplier of processors for smartphones and modem chips that connect phones to wireless data networks. It has invested heavily in developing lucrative 5G technology hoping to profit as it becomes mainstream in mobile phones, a trend poised to ramp up with the introduction of Apple\u2019s first 5G phones last month.  Revenue from the company\u2019s chip segment, its largest by sales, was $4.97 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared with FactSet estimates of $4.59 billion.  Qualcomm this year returned to being a major supplier for Apple, supplying chips that help the new iPhone 12 models connect to high-speed 5G networks. Apple did not give a forecast for its sales during the current quarter, making Qualcomm\u2019s chip sales one of the few proxies for investors to gauge the progress of the new iPhones.  But Qualcomm is supplying a broad swath of phone makers beyond Apple with 5G chips, which is driving revenue and profit growth. Apple\u2019s iPhone\u2019s launched a month later than usual, and, though he did not name Apple, Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf told Reuters in an interview that the contribution from new customer in the quarter was small.  \u201cThe results we just printed really include a smaller impact than you would normally see with one of the new customers that we\u2019re ramping up, just due to timing of their launch,\u201d he said.  Apple shares rose 0.6% after the announcement of Qualcomm\u2019s results.  Qualcomm said it shipped 162 million chips capable of wireless data connections during its fiscal fourth quarter, compared with FactSet estimates of 155.3 million.  Based on the shipments, the average selling price for chips was $30.9, higher than $29.3 in the previous quarter. That is in part because Qualcomm is increasingly paring its modem and processor chips with radio chips that drive up selling prices. Sales of those radio chips nearly doubled from the prior quarter to $852 million in the fourth quarter, helping drive adjusted earnings per share of $1.45 versus estimate of $1.17, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cThis is really the 5G story showing up in a big way in our business,\u201d Mollenkopf said.  Qualcomm expects chip segment revenue in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion for the unit during the first quarter, ahead of FactSet estimates of $5.71 billion.  Qualcomm, which makes the bulk of profits from its licensing business, said revenue from the unit was $1.51 billion, above FactSet estimates of $1.30 billion.  The company said it expects overall current-quarter revenue of between $7.8 billion and $8.6 billion, compared with analysts\u2019 estimates of $7.15 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Mollenkopf told Reuters the company expects overall 5G handset shipments this calendar year to come in at the top of the company\u2019s expected range of 175 million to 225 million units. The company also raised its forecast for 5G handset shipments for 2021 to a midpoint of 500 million units.  He also said Qualcomm has applied for licenses from the United States government to ship chips to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] but has received response yet from U.S. officials.","24":"SAN FRANCISCO, April 17 (Reuters) - As Qualcomm\u2019s major victory against Apple sent semiconductor stocks to record highs on Wednesday, the sector\u2019s strong recent rally may be at odds with uncertainty about an ongoing downturn in global demand.  With the Philadelphia Semiconductor index jumping 1.4% on Wednesday to its second straight record high and now up 35% year to date, upcoming March-quarter reports could become a make-or-break moment for investors.  \u201cPeople in the industry we speak to seem incredulous at the stock prices but are obviously more than willing to accept the benefit. Very simply, business is not as good as the stocks would imply and we would challenge someone to suggest their business has improved as much as their stock has,\u201d Semiconductors Advisors wrote in a client note.  Announced on Tuesday, Apple\u2019s surprise settlement with Qualcomm calls for its iPhones to once again use Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips. As a result, Qualcomm\u2019s stock has seen its strongest two-day gain since 1999, up 35% and adding $26 billion to the chipmaker\u2019s market capitalization.  \u201cThe resolution caps a multi-year period in which (Qualcomm\u2019s) stock has broadly been viewed as virtually uninvestible, and the resolution will likely go a long way toward assuaging investors who have been terrified of the potential for negative legal and regulatory outcomes,\u201d Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in report.  Intel surged 3.6% to a record high after it said hours after the Apple settlement was announced that it would stop making modem chips, an unprofitable business that some investors believe the company is better off without.  Despite Tuesday\u2019s seismic shift for the two California semiconductor makers, uncertainly blankets the global industry, with chipmakers yet to reach consensus that a downturn that started last year has touched bottom and little agreement about when and how strongly a recovery will occur.  That uncertainty will increase the focus on Texas Instruments Inc when it kicks off March-quarter reports for major U.S. chipmakers on April 23. Analysts on average expect an 8% drop in revenue for Texas Instruments\u2019 first quarter and a 5% drop for 2019, although bullish investors argue that industry estimates could rapidly rise as strong signs of a recovery emerge.  Intel reports on April 25, with analysts calling for a 0.3% revenue dip in the first quarter and a 3.7 percent slide in non-GAAP net income to $4.02 billion. Qualcomm reports on May 1. (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)","25":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The lead attorney for the group of Apple Inc device assemblers seeking at least $9 billion in damages from Qualcomm Inc said on Sunday the contract manufacturers are not in settlement talks with the mobile chip supplier and are \u201cgearing up and heading toward the trial\u201d in April.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The conflict is but one aspect of the global legal battle between regulators, Apple and Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips that help phones connect to wireless data networks.  Last week, Qualcomm secured a preliminary victory in a patent lawsuit in China that would have banned sales of some Apple iPhones there. Apple later said it believed it was already in compliance but would change its software \u201cto address any possible concern\u201d about its compliance.  But Qualcomm was also handed a setback in an antitrust lawsuit brought against it by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission when a judge said it will not be able to mention that Apple ditched Qualcomm chips for competing ones from Intel Corp when the case goes to trial next month.  Qualcomm representatives did not immediately return a request for comment on Sunday outside of U.S. business hours.  The group of contract manufacturers - which includes Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp and Compal Electronics Inc - became embroiled in the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm last year.  In the supply chain for electronics, contract manufacturers buy Qualcomm chips and pay royalties when they build phones, and are in turn reimbursed by companies like Apple. Qualcomm sued the group last year, alleging they had stopped paying royalties related to Apple products, and Apple joined their defense.  The contract manufacturers have since filed claims of their own against Qualcomm, alleging the San Diego company\u2019s practice of charging money for chips but then also asking for a cut of the adjusted selling price of a mobile phone as a patent royalty payment constitutes an anticompetitive business practice.  They are seeking $9 billion in damages from Qualcomm for royalties they allege were illegal. That figure could triple if the manufacturers succeed on their antitrust claims.  Ted Boutrous, a high-profile partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP who is representing the contract manufacturers, told Reuters that statements from Qualcomm executives suggesting there were meaningful settlement talks with the contract manufacturers were \u201cfalse.\u201d  \u201cTo the extent Qualcomm has indicated there have been licensing discussions with the contract manufacturers, they\u2019ve basically made the same sort of unreasonable demands that got them to where they are right now, which impose significant preconditions to even discuss a new arrangement,\u201d Boutrous said.  In July, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf told investors on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call that Qualcomm and Apple itself were in talks to resolve the litigation.  At a hearing in the case in San Diego on Nov. 30, one of Apple\u2019s attorneys disputed that notion, saying there had not been \u201ctalks in a number of months. So the parties are at loggerheads and are going ... to have to go into trial.\u201d","26":"Jan 3 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc said on Thursday that it has posted security bonds of 1.34 billion euros ($1.52 billion) in order to be able to enforce a German court order, which found that Apple had infringed the chipmakers patents on power saving technology used in smartphones.  According to the court order, Apple has to stop the sale, offer for sale and importation for sale of all infringing iPhones in Germany.  The court also ordered Apple to recall infringing iPhones from third party resellers in Germany, according to a statement by Qualcomm.","27":"May 11 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc:  * QUALCOMM EXTENDS CASH TENDER OFFER FOR ALL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF NXP  * QUALCOMM EXTENDS CASH TENDER OFFER FOR ALL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF NXP  * QUALCOMM INC - TENDER OFFER IS NOW SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON MAY 25, 2018 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","28":"April 25 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc:  * QUALCOMM QTRLY GAAP EPS $0.24, NON-GAAP EPS $0.80  * QTRLY GAAP REVENUE $5.3 BILLION VERSUS $5.0 BILLION REPORTED LAST YEAR  * QTRLY NON-GAAP REVENUE $5.2 BILLION VERSUS $6.0 BILLION REPORTED LAST YEAR  * Q2 EARNINGS PER SHARE VIEW $0.70, REVENUE VIEW $5.19 BILLION -- THOMSON REUTERS I\/B\/E\/S  * QTRLY QCT REVENUES OF $$3,897 MILLION VERSUS $3,676 MILLION REPORTED LAST YEAR  * QUALCOMM SEES Q3 NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE $0.65 - $0.75  * QUALCOMM SEES Q3 GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE $0.35 - $0.50  * Q3 EARNINGS PER SHARE VIEW $0.75 -- THOMSON REUTERS I\/B\/E\/S  * QTRLY QTL REVENUES OF $1,260 MILLION VERSUS $2,249 MILLION REPORTED LAST YEAR  * QUALCOMM SEES Q3 REVENUE $4.8 BILLION - $5.6 BILLION  * Q3 EARNINGS PER SHARE VIEW $0.75, REVENUE VIEW $5.32 BILLION -- THOMSON REUTERS I\/B\/E\/S  * QUALCOMM QTRLY GAAP RESULTS INCLUDED $310 MILLION OF CHARGES, OR ($0.18) PER SHARE, FROM RESTRUCTURING, COSTS RELATED TO COST PLAN ANNOUNCED IN JAN 2018  * QUALCOMM - FINANCIAL GUIDANCE FOR Q3 FISCAL 2018 EXCLUDES QTL REVENUES FOR ROYALTIES DUE ON SALES OF APPLE PRODUCTS BY APPLE\u2019S CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS  * SEES Q3 MSM CHIP SHIPMENTS OF 185 MILLION - 205 MILLION  * QUALCOMM - DUE TO TAX LEGISLATION, EVALUATING RESTRUCTURING OPTIONS TO CUT FISCAL 2018 ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATES TO ABOUT 410-417 PERCENT PROVISION FOR GAAP  * SEES Q3 QTL REVENUES $0.85 BILLION - $1.05 BILLION  * QUALCOMM - Q2 RESULTS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DISPUTE WITH APPLE & ITS CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, AS WELL AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED DISPUTE WITH ANOTHER LICENSEE  * QUALCOMM - MAKING GOOD PROGRESS ON EXECUTING $1 BILLION COST PLAN, ARE FOCUSED ON CLOSING PENDING ACQUISITION OF NXP  * \u201cWELL POSITIONED TO DRIVE THE GLOBAL COMMERCIALIZATION OF 5G\u201d  * QUALCOMM - Q3 2018 OUTLOOK ASSUMES RESTRUCTURING DUE TO TAX LEGISLATION OCCURS, RESULTING IN Q3 ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATES OF 38-47 PERCENT BENEFIT FOR GAAP  * NOT INCLUDED ESTIMATES RELATED TO OPERATING RESULTS OF PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF NXP IN Q3 OUTLOOK Source text: (bit.ly\/2Hu41Ho) Further company coverage:","29":"June 14 (Reuters) - Chinese regulators have approved Qualcomm Inc\u2019s proposed merger with NXP Semiconductors , South China Morning Post reported on Thursday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

In a filing that followed up on its letter to Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan on Thursday rebutting his latest offer, the San Diego-based company laid out more detail on its reservations about the deal.  It said two customers who provide more than $1 billion in chip revenue had said they would likely move designs away from Qualcomm if the deal went through, citing a lack of confidence in Broadcom's ability to continue to lead in technology. (bit.ly\/2nVvbOU)  Broadcom, which makes connectivity chips used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers, first approached Qualcomm in November.  After its first offer was rejected, Broadcom nominated a slate of directors to replace Qualcomm\u2019s board. Qualcomm shareholders are scheduled to vote on the nominations on March 6.  With that in mind, the company is seeking to strike a balance between continued resistance to Broadcom\u2019s takeover and heeding the calls of shareholders who have urged the company to engage with its rival in case it can clinch an attractive deal.  Qualcomm counts Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd among its key customers. Other clients include Huawei Technologies, LG Electronics, Oppo, Sony Corp, Vivo and Xiaomi, all of which make smartphones.  In rejecting Broadcom\u2019s latest offer on Thursday, Qualcomm offered to meet its rival to see if they can hammer out their differences. Broadcom welcomed the move, but said it wanted to meet before Qualcomm\u2019s proposed date on Tuesday, ahead of scheduled meetings with proxy advisory firms.  A date for a meeting between Qualcomm and Broadcom had not been finalized as of Friday morning.  In the filing on Friday, Qualcomm also raised concerns about potential antitrust issues and said Broadcom would damage, if not destroy, its licensing business that is valued at over $4 billion.  \u201cBroadcom completely ignores the reality that in the last five years, several large, complex international mergers involving multiple regulators have taken over 18 months. And at the moment, there is no \u2018next\u2019 step,\u201d Qualcomm said.  Broadcom said it will pay Qualcomm $8 billion if the deal fails to win regulatory approval.

Broadcom had said earlier that its revised offer was contingent on either Qualcomm buying NXP at currently disclosed terms of $110 per share in cash or the $38 billion deal being terminated.","35":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Monday kicks off a patent challenge to Apple Inc, capping off a two-year legal strategy to put pressure on the iPhone maker before a major antitrust lawsuit between the two goes to trial in April.  Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest maker of mobile chips, alleges in federal court in San Diego that Apple violated three of its patents, and is asking for tens of millions of dollars or more in damages.  The patent case is part of a two-year series of lawsuits around the world between the companies. Apple has alleged that Qualcomm engaged in illegal patent practices to protect a dominant position in the chip market, and Qualcomm has accused Apple of using its technology without compensation.  The legal saga will reach a crescendo in April, when an antitrust case filed by Apple in early 2017 heads to trial and challenges the foundation of Qualcomm\u2019s business model.  Since then, Qualcomm has filed a series of patent actions timed to conclude before the antitrust trial and rack up smaller victories against Apple. So far, Qualcomm has won a preliminary finding of infringement by U.S. trade regulators and partial iPhone sales bans in China and Germany, although the Chinese ban has not yet been enforced and Apple has resumed shipping phones in Germany after making changes.  U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw will open an eight-day trial on Monday to determine whether Apple violated Qualcomm patents around helping phones turn on more quickly and save battery life during tasks such as playing video games. Qualcomm alleges that phones with Intel modem chips, which connect phones to wireless data networks, violated the patents.  Apple has responded in court papers that it does not believe the patents are valid and that it does not infringe them. Apple has been found to infringe one of the patents in the suit during an unrelated case before the U.S. International Trade Commission, but that decision is not final and does not bind the court in San Diego. Apple also told trade regulators it believed it had a software solution to avoid the patent.  Qualcomm is asking for up to $1.41 in damages per infringing iPhone sold between mid-2017 and the autumn of 2018. The exact number of iPhones at stake has not been disclosed because Apple has never said how many of its phones contain Intel chips. Analysts believe that half of iPhones during that period contained Intel chips.","36":"BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Sahm Adrangi, who cemented his reputation with successful bets against Chinese internet companies, said that he has taken a short position against Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, arguing the chip supplier's stock price could shrink by half.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  Adrangi\u2019s hedge fund Kerrisdale Capital published a research paper that suggests Qualcomm\u2019s profits could be at risk as the company faces lawsuits, especially one in the United States.  If the company loses to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Kerrisdale said that Qualcomm would be forced to \u201clicense core patents to competitors and to renegotiate all of its existing licenses on fair terms.\u201d  That would create a \u201cperiod of immense confusion and uncertainty about Qualcomm\u2019s prospects - and ... could realistically cut Qualcomm\u2019s licensing revenue, earnings power, and stock price in half,\u201d the report says.  The Federal Trade Commission filed its case in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and is alleging that Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing and chip sale practices were anticompetitive and sought to preserve a monopoly on so-called premium LTE modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data network.  \u201cIn the past Qualcomm has been able to keep its business model going, but this time the threats are far more severe,\u201d Adrangi said. Previous legal troubles cost the company money.  A judgment against the company in this case could force an overhaul of its business model, the hedge fund argues. \u201cAs Qualcomm\u2019s long-running game of monopoly draws to a close, there will be no \u2018Get Out of Jail Free\u2019 card,\u201d the report said.  Kerrisdale is arguing that Judge Lucy Koh, who is presiding over the case, has already ruled against the company on several matters and may be inclined to rule for the FTC.  Qualcomm\u2019s stock traded at $54.16 on Tuesday and Kerrisdale sees a chance for it to fall by half in the next year or two.  The company has a market capitalization of $66 billion and its stock is owned by mutual fund companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity.  Kerrisdale is a New York- based hedge fund managing roughly $150 million in assets. But it has taken on big targets before, including satellite communications company Globalstar. It has a large social media presence and boasts a 37 percent gain in 2018, far better than the average hedge fund which lost roughly 4.5 percent.","37":"Feb 16 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc:  * QUALCOMM PROVIDES UPDATE ON MEETING WITH BROADCOM  * QUALCOMM INC - BOARD FOUND MEETING WITH BROADCOM \u201cTO BE CONSTRUCTIVE\u201d  * QUALCOMM INC - BOARD REMAINS UNANIMOUSLY OF VIEW THAT BROADCOM\u2019S PROPOSAL MATERIALLY \u201cUNDERVALUES\u201d QUALCOMM  * QUALCOMM - BROADCOM EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO AGREE TO SOME POTENTIAL ANTITRUST-RELATED DIVESTITURES BEYOND THOSE IN PREVIOUSLY FILED AGREEMENT  * QUALCOMM -BROADCOM CONTINUED TO RESIST AGREEING TO OTHER COMMITMENTS EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED BY FTC, EUROPEAN COMMISSION, MOFCOM, OTHER REGULATORY BODIES  * QUALCOMM - BROADCOM ALSO DECLINED TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS ABOUT INTENTIONS FOR FUTURE OF QUALCOMM\u2019S LICENSING BUSINESS  * QUALCOMM - BROADCOM INSISTS ON CONTROLLING MATERIAL DECISIONS ON CO\u2019S LICENSING BUSINESS DURING EXTENDED PERIOD BETWEEN SIGNING & POTENTIAL DEAL CLOSE  * QUALCOMM - BOARD IS INTENSELY FOCUSED ON MAXIMIZING VALUE FOR QUALCOMM STOCKHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXECUTING ON GROWTH STRATEGY OR BY SELLING CO  * QUALCOMM - IN FEB. 14 MEETING, BROADCOM REITERATED THAT $82.00 PER SHARE IS \u201cITS BEST AND FINAL PROPOSAL\u201d  * QUALCOMM INC - BOARD REMAINS UNANIMOUSLY OF VIEW THAT BROADCOM\u2019S PROPOSAL HAS AN \u201cUNACCEPTABLY\u201d HIGH LEVEL OF RISK  * QUALCOMM INC - BOARD OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS WITH BROADCOM TO SEE IF PROPOSAL THAT APPROPRIATELY REFLECTS \u201cTRUE VALUE\u201d OF CO\u2019S SHARES CAN BE OBTAINED Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","38":"People walk by a video display promoting 5G connectivity at the Qualcomm booth during the 2019 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 8, 2019. REUTERS\/Steve Marcus  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday introduced its second-generation of so-called modem chips to connect phones to 5G networks, speeding up the race around faster wireless data connections expected to begin rolling out later this year.  Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest mobile chip supplier, is hoping the device will fuel the spread of 5G phones later this year and next year. While Chinese phone makers such as Xiaomi Corp last year used Qualcomm\u2019s first-generation chip for small batches of 5G phones, the second-generation chip announced Tuesday is aimed at mass production.  The move comes a day before Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, the world\u2019s largest smart phone maker, is set to announce its new flagship Galaxy series phones. Samsung and Qualcomm in December publicly committed to working together to release a 5G phone this year, and analysts believe Samsung will unveil a 5G version of its flagship models this week.  Qualcomm\u2019s chips are entering a crowded field. Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world\u2019s third-largest smart phone maker, last month announced that it has built a 5G chip that it will use in its own phones. Samsung, too, has a 5G modem called the Exynos 5100 that will power many Samsung devices sold outside the United States. Taiwan-based MediaTek Inc also has 5G chip, with Intel Corp targeting the second half of this year for a release.  Carriers in Korea and China, meantime, are set to start turning on the networks this spring, with carriers in the United States planning rollouts for later this year.  For Qualcomm\u2019s part, the company is also introducing several chips surrounding the modem. Some elements of 5G phones, such as the design of antennas and chips for handling analog radio waves, are more complicated than previous generations of phones. Qualcomm aims to speed up adoption of 5G by also selling those technologies to phone makers.  \u201cThis year, virtually every major Android [phone maker] will be launching a phone with 5G,\u201d said Ignacio Contreras, head of 5G marketing for Qualcomm.  Apple Inc has not said when the iPhone will have 5G capabilities.  In its iPhones released last year, Apple dropped Qualcomm\u2019s chips in favor of those from Intel. Apple disclosed in a court hearing last month that it had held talks with MediaTek and Samsung about supplying modems for 2019 iPhones, but Bloomberg earlier reported that 5G iPhones will not appear until 2020.","39":"(Reuters) - The U.S. government has ordered a national security review of Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd's AVGO.O $117 billion bid for Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, in an unusual move that prompted Qualcomm to delay its March 6 shareholder meeting.  The government action on Sunday highlighted growing U.S. concerns about safeguarding semiconductor technology and cast a doubt on the deal\u2019s success. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals for potential national security concerns, rarely reviews mergers before companies have clinched an agreement.  CFIUS asked Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, by 30 days. Reuters reported last week that CFIUS had begun looking at Broadcom\u2019s bid as pressure grew from politicians, including senior Republican Senator John Cornyn.  \u201cThis measure will afford CFIUS the ability to investigate fully Broadcom\u2019s proposed acquisition of Qualcomm,\u201d the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees CFIUS, said in a statement.  Qualcomm said in a statement late on Monday that it was delaying its 2018 annual meeting to April 5 as a result of the CFIUS order.  Stockholders who have already voted would be able to change their votes at the meeting, it said.  The semiconductor industry is locked in a race to develop chips that power so-called 5G wireless technology, allowing the transmission of data at faster speeds. San Diego-based Qualcomm has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to Chinese companies vying for market share in the sector, such as Huawei Technologies Co, making it a prized asset.  A source familiar with CFIUS\u2019 thinking said that if the deal was completed, the U.S. military was concerned that within 10 years, \u201cthere would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that\u2019s essentially Huawei, and then the American carriers would have no choice. They would just have to buy Huawei (equipment).\u201d  Additionally, U.S. officials speaking on condition of anonymity said members of Congress and Federal Communications Commission officials were concerned that Broadcom could sell part of Qualcomm to a Chinese firm. Such a move could hurt the U.S. effort to develop 5G wireless technology because of the small existing number of suppliers that build the hardware.  A CFIUS review in itself does not mean a deal will be halted. CFIUS, under former President Barack Obama and current President Donald Trump, has soured on high-tech deals, particularly involving semiconductors, or involving sensitive information about American citizens.  Part of CFIUS\u2019 current concern, which is echoed in a letter Cornyn sent to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin last week, could lie in the fact that Broadcom has failed to strike a deal with Qualcomm. Instead, Broadcom has resorted to what is essentially a hostile takeover by putting forward a slate of six Broadcom nominees for Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board.  Broadcom shares closed down 1.6 percent, while Qualcomm fell 1.3 percent.  Cornyn said on Monday he was glad CFIUS had decided to review the deal, noting aggression by \u201cinternational rivals, like China.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is pictured in front of one of its many buildings in San Diego, California November 5, 2014. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  \u201cI support the idea that the committee on foreign investment takes a close look at that to see that American interests are protected,\u201d he added.  Broadcom has struggled to complete its proposed deal to buy Qualcomm as the latter has resisted, citing several concerns including the price offered and potential antitrust hurdles.  Broadcom said on Monday that CFIUS\u2019 intervention was the result of secret moves made by Qualcomm on Jan. 29 to seek an investigation into the offer, which Qualcomm\u2019s board has said significantly undervalues the company.  But Qualcomm, in a press statement, said \u201cBroadcom\u2019s claims that the CFIUS inquiry was a surprise to them has no basis in fact\u201d and that Broadcom had been interacting with CFIUS \u201cfor weeks.\u201d  Before Broadcom disclosed its buyout offer for Qualcomm in November, Trump himself announced Broadcom\u2019s plan to shift its headquarters back to the United States after a White House meeting with Chief Executive Hock Tan.  Trump praised the move at the time, calling Broadcom \u201cone of the really great, great companies.\u201d  Republican U.S. Senator Tom Cotton said on Monday he backed the panel\u2019s decision to delay a Qualcomm shareholder meeting, saying: \u201cQualcomm\u2019s work is too important to our national security to let it fall into the hands of a foreign company.\u201d  MOVING BACK TO THE U.S.  Broadcom said on Monday it is run by a board and senior management team consisting almost entirely of Americans and is largely owned by the same U.S. institutional investors that own Qualcomm.  \u201cBroadcom continues to pursue the redomiciliation process as expeditiously as possible,\u201d Broadcom said. \u201cUpon completion of the redomiciliation, Broadcom\u2019s proposed acquisition of Qualcomm will not be a CFIUS covered transaction.\u201d  Qualcomm, which has told shareholders it is open to the merger at the right price and terms, said last week it had no intention of delaying the annual shareholder meeting.  \"Qualcomm now has their excuse to postpone their critical vote, giving them some breathing room to work on its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O, attempt to make progress on their Apple Inc AAPL.O licensing issues, and attempt to build a stronger case for shareholders,\" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.  Qualcomm on Monday extended its $44 billion tender offer for NXP to March 9, as it awaits clearance from China\u2019s MOFCOM, the only regulator globally required to approve the deal that has yet to do so.  Qualcomm is also in a legal battle with Apple over licensing and allegations that it has not delivered on promised rebates - seen by analysts as an effort by Apple to undermine Qualcomm\u2019s strong position in mobile chips.","40":"(Reuters) - A rare public call by a U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) official for one of the agency\u2019s courtroom victories to be reversed, in a case of anticompetitive business practices by chipmaker Qualcomm Inc, charts a strong course for a judge\u2019s ruling to be overturned on appeal, some legal experts said.  FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen, as chip maker Broadcom Ltd announced an unsolicited bid to buy peer Qualcomm Inc for $103 billion, in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson, an appointee of Republican President Donald Trump, wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that the May 22 ruling against Qualcomm \u201cradically expanded a company\u2019s legal obligation to help its competitors\u201d and was based on a strained interpretation of a 1985 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California said that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices had strangled competition in parts of the computer chip market, harming rivals, smartphone makers, and consumers. She ordered the San Diego-based company to renegotiate licensing agreements at reasonable prices, without threatening to cut off supplies, and ordered that it be monitored for seven years to ensure its compliance.  The Qualcomm case has been controversial since it began in the final days of Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, with the lone Republican FTC commissioner at the time saying it should not be brought.  The op-ed by Wilson, one of five FTC commissioners, will not have any legal weight as Qualcomm appeals Koh\u2019s decision but foreshadows strong arguments the company has to win on appeal, Geoffrey Manne, director of the International Center for Law and Economics, and several other antitrust lawyers said.  Other experts, however, said the decision was well reasoned and relied on detailed factual findings and determinations of witness credibility that appeals courts would be reluctant to second-guess.  FTC spokesman Peter Kaplan said the agency declined to comment.  The judge has not yet ruled on Qualcomm\u2019s request to put her decision on hold as it plans an appeal. The ruling sent Qualcomm shares tumbling and shaved $10 billion off the company\u2019s value.  Under U.S. antitrust law, companies generally can decide who they want to do business with. Even monopolists do not have a so-called \u201cduty to deal\u201d with competitors.  \u2018ASPEN SKIING\u2019 U.S. SUPREME COURT CASE  But the Supreme Court created an exception to this rule in the 1985 case, known as \u201cAspen Skiing,\u201d holding that exiting a profitable, time-tested business arrangement could be an violation of competition law.  As Koh\u2019s ruling points out, Qualcomm once licensed its patents on industry-standard technology to rival chip makers, though the ruling does not make clear how extensive the practice was. Qualcomm abandoned the practice entirely in the early 2000s and began only licensing those patents to companies that make consumer devices such as smartphones, which contain chips.  Koh said Qualcomm\u2019s about-face was \u201cmotivated by anticompetitive malice\u201d and was the sort of conduct prohibited by Aspen Skiing.  In Aspen Skiing, a ski resort operator backed out of a profitable, long-standing agreement with a rival to jointly sell a combination lift ticket package.  The Supreme Court said the company appeared to be sacrificing immediate profits in hopes of stomping out a competitor in the long run.  Qualcomm argued at trial that it never granted so-called \u201cexhaustive\u201d full licenses to other chip suppliers. Requiring it to grant them now, as Koh has ordered, would force it into a new business arrangement, rather than require a return to a previous one, the company argued.  The FTC\u2019s Wilson wrote that Koh had misapplied the Supreme Court case. Under the judge\u2019s logic, \u201cAspen Skiing now means that if a company ever sells any product to any competitor, it then could have a perpetual antitrust obligation to sell every product to every competitor,\u201d Wilson said.  Jonathan Barnett, a law professor at the University of Southern California, agreed that Koh\u2019s decision was in danger of being overturned by an appeals court.  The exception created by Aspen Skiing was supposed to be \u201cvery narrow,\u201d Barnett said. In a 2004 case involving Verizon Communications Inc, the high court cast doubt on Aspen Skiing, saying it was \u201cat or near the outer boundary\u201d of antitrust liability.  Manne said Koh erred in comparing Qualcomm\u2019s change in licensing practices to the conduct in Aspen Skiing.  The shift to device-level licensing \u201chardly originated with Qualcomm\u201d and made a great deal of business sense because it was much more lucrative, Manne said.  But some legal experts said that Koh\u2019s heavy reliance on factual determinations, particularly findings that Qualcomm executives lacked credibility on the witness stand, made her ruling harder to challenge.  Appeals courts will not set aside a trial judge\u2019s factual findings unless there is \u201cclear error\u201d - a high standard that is difficult to meet.  Koh, for example, said in her decision that \u201cmany Qualcomm executives\u2019 trial testimony was contradicted by these witnesses\u2019 own contemporaneous emails, handwritten notes, and recorded statements to the Internal Revenue Service.\u201d  One Qualcomm in-house lawyer \u201cpretended not to recall\u201d details of a 2012 meeting until the FTC\u2019s lawyers played a recording from it, Koh said. And Qualcomm executives often responded with \u201cfast and practiced narratives\u201d when questioned by their own lawyers, Koh said.  \u201cIt was embarrassing and probably really damaging on appeal that Koh carefully documented the Qualcomm executives pretty clear lies in testimony,\u201d said Christopher Sagers, a professor of antitrust law at Cleveland State University.  Qualcomm said in a statement that it believes \u201ca thorough examination of the evidence and the proper interpretation of the law will result in a reversal by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d  Manne said that even under the deferential approach taken by appeals courts, Koh\u2019s decision was on thin ice.  \u201cI definitely think she is incorrect on the law with respect to the duty to deal and Aspen Skiing, and she\u2019s vulnerable to reversal on appeal,\u201d Manne said.","41":"Oct 28 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday handed a victory to Qualcomm Inc, declining to reconsider an August decision that dismissed the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\u2019s antitrust case against the chipmaker.

Broadcom said its latest offer was \u201cbest and final\u201d and that it had strong Qualcomm stockholder support.  Qualcomm had rejected Broadcom\u2019s first unsolicited $103 billion acquisition offer in November, without engaging further. In response, Broadcom nominated a slate of directors to replace Qualcomm\u2019s board.  Qualcomm shareholders are scheduled to vote on these nominations at a March 6 meeting.  Qualcomm said Broadcom\u2019s latest $82 per share offer, comprising $60 per share in cash and $22 per share in stock, \u201cmaterially undervalues\u201d Qualcomm and falls short of the firm regulatory commitment it would demand given the significant antitrust risks involved.  Qualcomm shares were up 1.1 percent at $63.12 in after-hours trading on Thursday. Broadcom shares were up 1 percent at $232.00.  Broadcom has promised to pay a breakup fee of $8 billion in the event regulators thwart the deal, as well as a \u201cticking\u201d fee of 6 percent per year on the cash portion of the consideration if the deal takes more than 12 months to close.  Qualcomm argued on Thursday this would not compensate Qualcomm if several large customers were to walk away or infringe their licensing agreements.  It believes Broadcom needs to offer a \u201chell-or-high-water\u201d legal commitment to complete the deal irrespective of divestitures that antitrust watchdogs around the world may require.  \u201cIf you are not willing to agree to do whatever is necessary to ensure a transaction closes, we will need you to be extremely clear and specific about exactly what actions you would refuse to take, so that we can properly evaluate the risk to Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders,\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s Jacobs wrote to Broadcom\u2019s Tan in a letter published by Qualcomm.  Qualcomm also said in its statement that Broadcom\u2019s plan to address antitrust concerns by selling two Qualcomm businesses, its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones, was inadequate to allay concerns that the deal would not win regulatory approval.  Qualcomm added that the regulatory approval process could take longer than 18 months and disrupt Qualcomm during a period of explosive innovation in the industry that includes the development of 5G mobile phones, autonomous driving and the expanding use of computerized gadgets from refrigerators to thermostats.  NXP DEAL  The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices.  Singapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. Qualcomm primarily licenses its technology for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  Broadcom said on Monday its improved offer was premised on either Qualcomm acquiring NXP Semiconductors NV at the current disclosed terms of $110 per share in cash, or the $38 billion transaction being terminated.  NXP shareholders, led by activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, are resisting the deal, pushing for Qualcomm to raise its offer. NXP shares closed at $115.94 on Thursday, indicating investors were expecting a sweeter deal.  Qualcomm\u2019s proposed acquisition of NXP was approved by European Union antitrust regulators last month. Qualcomm expects China\u2019s blessing as early as this month, at which point it has to decide whether it would raise its offer.

REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  (Reuters) - A group of tech companies and automakers, including Tesla Inc TSLA.O, Ford Motor Co F.N, Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, on Monday urged the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to seek an appeal after its loss in a case against chip supplier Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O.  Earlier this month a U.S. appeals court reversed a lower-court decision against Qualcomm, which makes technology for connecting devices to mobile data networks. The court also vacated an injunction that would have required Qualcomm to change its patent licensing practices.  Qualcomm was fighting a May 2019 decision by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, in a case brought by the FTC. Koh sided with the FTC, writing that Qualcomm\u2019s practice of requiring phone makers to sign a patent license agreement before selling them chips \u201cstrangled competition\u201d and harmed consumers.  Automakers have increasingly put chips in vehicles to connect them to the internet, which requires them to sign patent agreements for communications standards such as 5G. The companies had previously argued that connected car prices could go up if Qualcomm won its case.  Qualcomm won its appeal of that ruling before the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in an Aug. 11 ruling by a three-judge panel. In a letter sent Monday, the automakers, as well as Qualcomm rivals Intel Corp INTC.O and MediaTek Inc 2454.TW, urged the FTC to seek an \"en banc\" rehearing of the case by the full appeals court.  \u201cIf allowed to stand, the panel\u2019s decision could destabilize  the standards ecosystem by encouraging the abuse of market power acquired through collaborative standard-setting,\u201d the group said.  An FTC spokeswoman declined to comment.","50":"(Reuters) - U.S. semiconductor company Qualcomm Inc should try to negotiate a sale to Broadcom Ltd following the latter\u2019s sweetened $121 billion offer, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) said.  FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Qualcomm has been seeking to walk a fine line between resisting Broadcom\u2019s acquisition approach, which it says undervalues it and is fraught with regulatory risks, and demonstrating to shareholders and proxy advisory firms such as ISS that it is willing to engage to secure a better deal if possible.  In a report published late on Friday, ISS recommended to Qualcomm shareholders that they vote for four out of the six board director nominees that Broadcom has put forward for election at Qualcomm\u2019s shareholder meeting on March 6.  While this recommendation would fall short of Broadcom\u2019s nominees winning a majority on Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board, ISS said such a vote by Qualcomm shareholders would offer a reasonable path to a negotiated deal that would deliver value.  \u201cThe tenor of (Qualcomm\u2019s) engagement leading up to the present raises questions as to whether the incumbent (Qualcomm) board is committed to playing its part in attempting to maximize the offer,\u201d ISS said in its report.  Broadcom first unveiled an unsolicited $70 per share cash-and-stock offer in November, which Qualcomm rejected. It raised its offer to $82 per share in cash and stock on Feb. 5 and offered other concessions, including paying an $8 billion breakup fee in the event regulators thwart the deal, which would be the technology sector\u2019s largest-ever acquisition.  ISS said it did not recommend voting for all six Broadcom nominees because Qualcomm\u2019s board would then be less inclined to drive a hard bargain with Broadcom in deal negotiations. ISS recommended that Broadcom nominees Samih Elhage, Julie Hill, John Kispert and Harry You should be elected as Qualcomm board directors.  Qualcomm on Friday called a Feb. 14 meeting with Broadcom constructive and opened the door to more talks, but continued to reject the proposed deal.  As of Saturday afternoon, no new meeting between the two companies had been scheduled, according to people familiar with the matter. Broadcom and Qualcomm representatives offered no immediate comment.  The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd use their market dominance to negotiate lower chip prices.  Singapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily outsources the manufacturing of its chips which are used for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  ISS said in its report that Broadcom\u2019s latest $82 per share cash-and-stock bid, which Broadcom CEO Hock Tan has called its best and final offer, does not appear to be clearly superior to Qualcomm\u2019s potential standalone value in the short term. ISS added, however, that the offer seemed to represent a reasonable starting point for negotiations.  Even though both companies \u201chave adopted strategies that do not lend themselves to fluid negotiations,\u201d a deal between them is possible, ISS said. It suggested that Qualcomm shareholders could gain greater exposure to the deal\u2019s potential upside if they were to receive more of the combined company.  ISS also said it appeared more likely than not that Broadcom and Qualcomm, with their collective experience and resources, can find a reasonable path to regulatory approval, despite Qualcomm\u2019s current concerns about antitrust risk.  NXP DEAL  Qualcomm is currently seeking to complete a $38 billion deal to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV, which is still pending regulatory approval. NXP shares ended trading on Friday at $118.50, significantly above Qualcomm\u2019s $110 per share all-cash offer, as some NXP shareholders, led by activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, have called on Qualcomm to raise its price.  Broadcom has said its acquisition offer is contingent on either Qualcomm buying NXP at currently disclosed terms of $110 per share in cash or the deal being terminated.  ISS said in its report that Qualcomm could negotiate provisions with Broadcom to close the NXP deal at a mutually agreed price, which would provide Qualcomm with the \u201cnext-best safety net of diversification\u201d in the event the deal with Broadcom falls through.  China\u2019s MOFCOM is the only regulator globally required to approve the Qualcomm-NXP deal that has yet to do so. With the start of the Chinese New Year public holiday this week, Qualcomm may now delay its decision on raising its offer for NXP until after the March 6 Qualcomm shareholder meeting.","51":"Nov 29 (Reuters) - Intel Corp sold its smartphone modem chip business to Apple Inc at \u201ca multi-billion dollar loss,\u201d the U.S. chipmaker said in a court filing on Friday, alleging that rival Qualcomm Inc forced it out of the market.  Intel made the claims in a brief filed with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where Qualcomm is seeking to overturn a sweeping antitrust decision against it after losing a lawsuit by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Intel, whose executives testified at the trial, argued on Friday that the ruling should stand. Appeal proceedings are expected to begin in January.  In a 233-page decision issued in May, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose wrote that Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices \u201cstrangled competition\u201d in parts of the market for modem chips that connect smartphones to mobile data networks. She ordered the San Diego-based company to renegotiate licensing agreements at reasonable prices.  Qualcomm appealed Koh\u2019s ruling and won a pause in enforcement while the appeal unfolds.  Intel was Qualcomm\u2019s chief rival in modem chips, and sold the components to Apple for the iPhone. But Apple signed a chip supply agreement with Qualcomm after they settled a major legal battle in May. Hours later, Santa Clara, California-based Intel said it would sell its modem chip business.  In July, Apple bought the Intel unit in deal valued at $1 billion.  In its court filing and an accompanying blog post published on Friday, Intel said it was forced out of the market because of Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices and supported the FTC\u2019s case against Qualcomm.  \u201cWe invested billions, hired thousands, acquired two companies and built innovative world-class products that eventually made their way into Apple\u2019s industry-leading iPhones, including the most recently released iPhone 11,\u201d Steven R. Rodgers, Intel\u2019s general counsel, wrote in the post.  \u201cBut when all was said and done, Intel could not overcome the artificial and insurmountable barriers to fair competition created by Qualcomm\u2019s scheme and was forced to exit the market this year.\u201d  Qualcomm has denied the FTC\u2019s accusations, and other parts of the U.S. government urged the appeals court to pause enforcement of the FTC ruling against it. In July, the Pentagon and the Department of Energy said Qualcomm was a \u201ctrusted\u201d supplier of 5G technology and would be \u201cimpossible to replace\u201d in the short term if put out of business. (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Richard Chang)","52":"(Repeats story first published on March 5, no change to text)  March 5 (Reuters) - A U.S. national security panel\u2019s unusual decision to review Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd\u2019s $117 billion hostile bid for smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm Ltd illustrates an expanding focus on the competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry amid advances by China, regulatory experts said.  The secretive panel, called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), has scuppered several attempts by Chinese technology companies to acquire U.S. chipmakers in the last 12 months over concerns about the transfer of potentially sensitive technology.  Broadcom is not a Chinese company, and has pledged to move its domicile from Singapore to the United States, arguing this will makes its acquisition of Qualcomm not covered by CFIUS. However, many of Qualcomm\u2019s rivals, including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, are Chinese.  Huawei is forging closer commercial ties with big telecommunication operators across Asia, the Americas and Europe, putting the company in prime position to lead the global race for wireless 5G networks, despite U.S. allegations it poses a security threat.  CFIUS views Qualcomm as a prized U.S. asset in the development of 5G wireless technology, which allows for the transmission of data at very fast speeds. It wants to make sure Qualcomm does not lose its status as a dominant player in wireless chip technology, according to a source familiar with the panel\u2019s thinking.  As a result, Broadcom\u2019s business plan for Qualcomm, including any divestitures it plans in order to appease antitrust regulators, will be scrutinized by CFIUS, lawyers who advised companies on their CFIUS applications said.  \u201cThis shows how indirect exposure to China is a frequent, but under-noticed, source of perceived national security risk,\u201d said Mario Mancuso, a former CFIUS member who is now a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP.  CFIUS\u2019 stance has toughened as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to pressure China to help tackle North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions and be more accommodative on trade and foreign exchange issues.  Unfilled political vacancies in several government departments and agencies have also made it harder for CFIUS to approve deals.  Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC, a U.S.-based private equity firm funded by the Chinese government, saw its $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor Corp collapse last year after it was blocked by CFIUS, a rejection subsequently upheld by Trump.  Last month, U.S. semiconductor testing company Xcerra Corp said CFIUS had blocked its $580 million sale to a Chinese state-backed semiconductor investment fund.  Reuters reported last week that CFIUS had begun looking at Broadcom\u2019s bid as pressure grew from politicians, including senior Republican U.S. Senator John Cornyn.  \u201cQualcomm is a leader in 5G technology, which is going to be the new standard in the future. And, as we\u2019ve seen, some of our international rivals, like China, have been incredibly aggressive and strategic,\u201d Cornyn said on Monday. He has proposed legislation to tighten CFIUS\u2019 scrutiny of deals.  PROXY CONTEST  CFIUS\u2019 intervention was unusual in that the panel typically reviews signed deals. However, Qualcomm has been resisting Broadcom\u2019s overtures, prompting the latter to nominate six directors to Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board at its shareholder meeting. CFIUS on Sunday ordered Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, which was scheduled for Tuesday, for a month.  Qualcomm filed a voluntary request for CFIUS to review Broadcom\u2019s bid on Jan. 29. CFIUS rules allow a company facing an unsolicited takeover bid to request a CFIUS review, so that its board of directors can better assess the regulatory risk of a deal.  \u201cThe rules say that one party alone could approach CFIUS and for a review,\u201d said McDermott Will & Emery LLP regulatory lawyer David Levine.  Such circumstances are few and far between. Miner Rio Tinto Plc asked CFIUS for a review in 2008 after facing a hostile $150 billion bid by BHP Billiton Ltd, according to a source familiar with the matter. CFIUS allowed the bid, but BHP subsequently walked away from the deal in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  Broadcom struggled to win CFIUS approval to buy Brocade Communications Systems late last year. In the end, that approval came just weeks after Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan announced in an Oval Office ceremony with Trump that Broadcom would bring its headquarters to the United States.

FILE PHOTO: A woman walks past a sign advertising Qualcomm at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Shanghai, China June 28, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song  The company on May 21 lost in an antitrust lawsuit and has been fighting to have the ruling put on hold while it pursued an appeal.  The San Diego-based company argued that letting the ruling stand could upend its talks with phone makers over chips for 5G, the next generation of wireless data networks.  In the ruling issued on Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put on hold the provisions of the earlier ruling that required Qualcomm to grant patent licenses to rival chip suppliers and end its practice of requiring its chip customers to sign a patent license before purchasing chips.  The earlier ruling would have required Qualcomm to renegotiate all of its existing chip and patent deals, as well as make new deals conform to the requirements. The stay granted Friday puts on hold the effect of parts of the ruling while the appeals process, which could take a year or more, plays out.  The Qualcomm antitrust case was unique in that different parts of the U.S. government weighed in with differing views. The Department of Justice - the other primary antitrust regulator in the United States - said during the initial trial that it disagreed with the FTC\u2019s legal theory. And after the trial judge handed down a decision, the Pentagon and the Department of Energy both made filings saying that enforcing the decision would harm national security.  \u201cThe government itself is divided about the propriety of the judgment and its impact on the public interest,\u201d the appeals court wrote in its ruling.  Shares rose briefly after the news but then dropped 3.7% to $74.29 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Shares have been volatile this year, rising from the mid-$50 range to above $85 after Qualcomm settled a major lawsuit with Apple Inc, but then dropping to the mid-$60 range after its loss of the case brought by the FTC.  The company has not formally filed its appeal in the FTC lawsuit. After Qualcomm files its arguments, the appeal will take place in January.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple and Qualcomm have faced up to their mutual need. The $940 billion smartphone maker and $85 billion mobile-chip firm on Tuesday ended a two-year fight over royalties with a licensing agreement and a cash payment to Qualcomm. Apple can\u2019t risk being stuck with second-rate semiconductors in its devices, and Qualcomm has huge revenue at stake. At first blush, both sides benefit from the truce.  Their lawyers have been kept busy since 2017 by the argument over how Qualcomm charges for chips that connect smartphones to data networks. Apple accused Qualcomm of withholding parts from suppliers unless they agreed to pay high royalties, something the iPhone maker said was anti-competitive. Qualcomm said Apple had put pressure on suppliers not to pay. The numbers were pretty big, even for such huge companies: Apple was seeking as much as $27 billion in damages, while its supplier-cum-adversary wanted up to $15 billion.  The nature of the truce is hazy. Neither side is saying how big Apple\u2019s payment is, or what future royalties will be. Qualcomm did point out in a presentation to investors, however, that it expects an incremental $2 per share of earnings; details on exactly how and when that flows through are nonexistent, but with 1.2 billion shares outstanding, that probably implies a hefty payment. History suggests Apple, meanwhile, will get sweeter terms than it had before the dispute. About a decade ago, then-dominant phone maker Nokia and Qualcomm settled a similar dispute with Nokia getting a discount.  Investors seem to believe there are no losers. Apple\u2019s shares rose slightly, adding around $1 billion to its market capitalization, reflecting that it will now have access to 5G chips from the dominant supplier. That\u2019s better than the risk of delays in future iPhones, or worse, inferior handsets. Qualcomm\u2019s market value jumped by $15 billion, or more than a fifth, as investors penciled in large, high-margin royalty payments down the road. Both sides can just about claim to have come out on top.","57":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom Ltd, which is seeking to buy rival Qualcomm Inc, plans to complete its move back to the United States by mid-May, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Broadcom said in November that it would return to the United States but did not say when the move would happen.  Broadcom shareholders will vote on the proposal by May 6, after which it must be confirmed by a judge. Once that happens, which is expected in early to mid-May, the redomiciling can happen quickly, according to a source familiar with the matter.  The entire process is likely to be wrapped up as soon as mid-May, the source added.  Broadcom was a U.S. company until it was bought in 2016 by Singapore\u2019s Avago, which decided to use the name Broadcom.  Despite Broadcom\u2019s plans to move back to the United States, CFIUS has already shown an interest in the proposed transaction because Broadcom has proposed six directors for Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board. The vote on that slate is set for Tuesday.  Broadcom has argued that CFIUS\u2019 concern is unwarranted since it does not control the directors that it proposed.  \u201cBroadcom could not and will not control the Qualcomm board - the essential basis for CFIUS jurisdiction - in the event some or all of the independent, Broadcom-nominated directors are elected,\u201d the company said in a statement on Friday.

Shares of the company, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, were up more than 1% in after-hours trading.  The above-estimates forecast comes weeks after chipmakers Intel Corp and Texas Instruments calmed investor nerves with their upbeat annual forecasts. Analysts view 2020 as a recovery year for chipmakers, driven by 5G spending for both smartphones and network upgrades.  Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf attributed the strength to higher demand for the company\u2019s radio-frequency chips for mobile phones, a relatively new business where Qualcomm is trying to persuade phone makers to include more of its chips as the devices become more complex for 5G networks.  The company\u2019s chips are essential components in many mobile devices and it is a top supplier to South Korean smartphone makers Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics , as well as Apple Inc.  Qualcomm forecast total revenue in the range of between $4.9 billion and $5.7 billion for its second quarter, the mid-point of which is largely above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $5.08 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

But Qualcomm\u2019s forecasts suggested Apple\u2019s licensing fees were not a big enough revenue boost to offset a weakening smartphone market.  Qualcomm will book a one-time payment of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in the fiscal third quarter from the settlement, as Apple catches up on royalties that the iPhone maker did not pay while they were locked a legal dispute.  Excluding that payment, Qualcomm estimated $4.7 billion to $5.5 billion in revenue, generally below the $5.29 billion analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The shortfall was driven by a weak Chinese smartphone market, where Qualcomm believes consumers are holding off on buying new phones until new 5G networks roll out later this year.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to having a 5G Christmas as the year ends,\u201d Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm\u2019s chip chief, said on a conference call with investors.

Financial details have not been disclosed but the deal is expected to help Qualcomm regain the preeminent mobile chip position it held in the early 2010s.  Qualcomm estimated $1.23 billion to $1.33 billion in revenue for its licensing business in the third quarter, above analysts\u2019 consensus forecast of $1.22 billion.  The licensing revenue outlook includes royalties from sales of Apple products. Apple on Tuesday said its gross margin guidance, which was largely unchanged from previous quarters, included the Qualcomm settlement.

Qualcomm executives cited economic weakness in China as a reason for the lower-than-expected sales forecast. Apple said on Tuesday it saw a slight uptick in China sales toward the end of its fiscal second quarter, following cuts in iPhone prices and other factors.  Qualcomm remains in a license dispute with Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, but the Chinese company has been making interim payments as negotiations continue. Qualcomm resolved a dispute with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd last year.  \u201cWe feel that the Apple resolution enhances our ability to resolve issues with Huawei,\u201d Alex Rogers, Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing chief, said on a conference call with investors.

Qualcomm\u2019s Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf in November made comments about the supplier\u2019s efforts to resolve the dispute.  But Qualcomm on Tuesday said Cook had miscast Mollenkopf\u2019s remarks, which did not mention a settlement and which Qualcomm maintains are accurate.  The war of words is unlikely to play a major role in the outcome of the legal fight between the two firms. But it signals the high stakes and deeply entrenched positions of each side, with Apple arguing in court that Qualcomm charges an unfair \u201ctax\u201d on its phones while Qualcomm fights to protect a patent licensing model it argues has helped bring connectivity to billions of new users through wireless networks.  In a television interview on CNBC earlier on Tuesday, Cook responded to a question from host Jim Cramer about whether Apple would settle with Qualcomm after Qualcomm had announced legal victories against Apple in patent cases in China and Germany.  \u201cLook, the truth is, we haven\u2019t been in any settlement discussions with them since the third calendar quarter of last year. That is the truth. So I\u2019m not sure where that thinking is coming from,\u201d Cook said.  Cook\u2019s comments contrasted with those Mollenkopf made in November on CNBC.  \u201cWe do talk as companies, and I think what you\u2019re seeing, really, are activities consistent, really, with the fourth quarter of the game, and not the first quarter,\u201d Mollenkopf told CNBC then. \u201cWe always talk about - and I\u2019ve been very consistent that this second half of (2018) and into (2019), is when we\u2019re really on the doorstep of finding a resolution.\u201d  In a statement, Qualcomm said the company stands by Mollenkopf\u2019s remarks.  \u201cWe have been consistent for the last 18 months in making clear that we have, at various times, been in discussions with Apple about a possible resolution to our licensing dispute,\u201d a Qualcomm spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe have also stated clearly on several occasions that we believe it will be resolved, one way or the other, in the near future, either through a settlement or court decisions.\u201d  Apple on Wednesday said Cook\u2019s comments were accurate.  \u201cQualcomm is desperate to obfuscate the tales it has been telling its investors. Their accusations are a red herring,\u201d Apple said in a statement to Reuters.  Apple has accused Qualcomm of engaging in illegal patent licensing practices to preserve a dominant market position in so-called modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has argued that its practices followed decades-long tech industry norms and that Apple has not compensated it fairly for its intellectual property.  The primary case in Apple and Qualcomm\u2019s legal battle goes to trial in April.","62":"April 27 (Reuters) - NXP Semiconductors NV:  * QUALCOMM EXTENDS CASH TENDER OFFER FOR ALL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF NXP  * QUALCOMM - TENDER OFFER IS NOW SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AT 5:00 P.M., NEW YORK CITY TIME, ON MAY 11, 2018, UNLESS EXTENDED OR EARLIER TERMINATED Source text: [prn.to\/2r56EbF] Further company coverage:","63":"May 21 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc:  * QUALCOMM INC FILES FOR POTENTIAL MIXED SHELF OFFERING; SIZE NOT DISCLOSED- SEC FILING Source text - (bit.ly\/2KIT8Tv) Further company coverage:","64":"(Reuters) - Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O is planning to scrap its bid for Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, after U.S. President Donald Trump blocked the chipmaker's proposed acquisition on national security grounds earlier this week, although it will press on with its plan to move its base to the United States, according to sources familiar with the matter.  Broadcom\u2019s board was meeting on Tuesday night to formalize its plans and it could make an announcement as soon as Wednesday, the two sources added. The company will also drop its challenge to Qualcomm\u2019s board, the people added.  Broadcom will continue with its plan to redomicile to the United States, a move that will cost it about $500 million a year under a higher tax rate, the sources added.  Being based in the United States as opposed to Singapore will allow Broadcom to make what it believes will be acquisitions of U.S. companies that will not fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns.  Broadcom and Qualcomm could not be immediately reached for comment.  DEAD DEAL  Trump signed an order late on Monday to halt what would have been the biggest-ever technology deal on concerns that a takeover of Qualcomm by the Singapore-based company would erode the United States\u2019 lead in mobile technology and give China the upper hand.  The deal, spearheaded by CEO Hock Tan, would have created the world\u2019s No. 3 semiconductor company with a leading market share in smartphones, car electronics and industrial internet devices.  Analysts said Broadcom can still build heft through smaller deals. And it could have an easier time buying U.S. targets if it goes through with plans to redomicilie in the United States.  Tan has already turned Avago, a small chipmaker with a market value of $3.5 billion in 2009, into a more than $100 billion company.  Tan bought California-based companies Broadcom for $37 billion in a leveraged deal in 2015 and Brocade Communications in a $5.5 billion deal two years later.  San Diego-based Qualcomm evolved from a U.S. military aerospace contractor to become the dominant player in wireless radio technology over the past two decades, with its chips used in half of all smartphones.  It fended off antitrust concerns around the globe over its intellectual property strategies, taking the biggest share of wireless royalties in the 3G and 4G eras and getting a head start on next decade\u2019s 5G era, which promises to embed wireless connections in cars, factories, homes and cities.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  SMALLER BITES  Broadcom now has ample firepower for smaller deals, with about $11 billion in cash and the potential to generate nearly $9 billion in annual free cash flow, analysts estimate.  CFIUS, which raised concerns about the Qualcomm deal with Trump, listed the highly leveraged nature of Broadcom\u2019s bid for its larger rival as a major concern coupled with the risk of the U.S. losing mobile technology leadership.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Broadcom had planned since last year to relocate its legal headquarters to the United States, avoiding the need for a CFIUS review.  \u201cIf Broadcom completes its redomiciling in the U.S. in a way that extinguishes any non-U.S. ownership or control, then I think they can open the door to many, if not all, acquisitions ... they would effectively no longer be subject to a CFIUS-initiated review or investigation,\u201d said Guillermo Christensen, a lawyer who works on CFIUS issues at Brown Rudnick in Washington.  \u201cBut that really hinges on completely severing the foreign ownership connection,\u201d he said.","65":"FILE PHOTO: Visitors are seen by a booth of Qualcomm Inc at the China International Big Data Industry Expo in Guiyang, Guizhou province, China May 27, 2018.

The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) is conducting the antitrust review in a fair and open way, the regulator said in a faxed response to a Reuters request for comment.  Clearance for the takeover comes at a time of rising U.S.-China trade tension. People familiar with the matter have told Reuters that approval would depend on the progress of broader bilateral talks and the unwinding of a U.S. government ban on sales by U.S. companies to China's ZTE Corp 000063.SZ.  The Qualcomm merger of NXP has been approved by eight of nine required global regulators, with Chinese clearance the only one pending.  The U.S. chipmaker, which initially announced its bid for the Dutch semiconductor company in October 2016, refiled its application to Chinese authorities for the second time in April.  \u201cSAMR is currently conducting an antitrust review of the case of Qualcomm\u2019s equity acquisition of NXP, and is in discussions with Qualcomm on how to eliminate the negative effects created by this deal,\u201d the regulator said.  \u201cSAMR, in line with anti-monopoly law, will conduct this review openly, fairly and impartially,\u201d it said.

NXP Chief Executive Richard Clemmer, announcing a $5 billion share buyback, said the experience would put his company off looking at any big transaction in the near future.  He called China\u2019s treatment of the company \u201cunfair\u201d, and said he had expected the lifting of a ban on U.S. chipmakers doing business with ZTE would clear the way for the NXP deal.  \u201cIt was considered to be one of the factors in discussions with the Chinese relative to the regulatory process, so its quite surprising that the Chinese made the decision and did not approve the transaction,\u201d he said in the company\u2019s first conference call with analysts in nearly two years.  NXP said it had received a promised $2 billion break fee from Qualcomm on Thursday morning and Clemmer said it also expected to recoup $31 million in costs it lost as a result of the brief ban on trading with ZTE earlier this year.

FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is seen during the China International Import Expo (CIIE), at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  Qualcomm is seeking the ban in hopes of dealing Apple a blow before the two begin a major trial in mid-April in San Diego over Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has sought to apply pressure to Apple with smaller legal challenges ahead of that trial and has won partial iPhone sales bans in China and Germany against Apple, forcing the iPhone maker to ship only phones with Qualcomm chips to some markets.  Any possible ban on iPhone imports to the United States could be short-lived because Apple last week for the first time disclosed that it has found a software fix to avoid infringing on one of Qualcomm\u2019s patents. Apple asked regulators to give it as much as six months to prove that the fix works.  Qualcomm brought a case against Apple at the U.S International Trade Commission in 2017 alleging that some iPhones violated Qualcomm patents to help smart phones run well without draining their batteries. Qualcomm asked for an import ban on some older iPhone models containing Intel Corp chips.  In September, Thomas Pender, an administrative law judge at the ITC, found that Apple violated one of the patents in the case but declined to issue a ban. Pender reasoned that imposing a ban on Intel-chipped iPhones would hand Qualcomm an effective monopoly on the U.S. market for modem chips, which connect smart phones to wireless data networks.  Pender\u2019s ruling said that preserving competition in the modem chip market was in the public interest as speedier 5G networks come online in the next few years.  Cases where the ITC finds patent violations but does not ban the import of products are rare. In December, the full ITC said it would review Pender\u2019s decision and decide whether to uphold or reverse it by late March.  In filings that became public late last week ahead of the full commission\u2019s decision, Apple for the first time said that it had developed a software fix to avoid running afoul of Qualcomm\u2019s patent. Apple said it did not discover the fix until after the trial and that it implemented the new software \u201clast fall.\u201d  But Apple said that it would need six months to verify that the fix will satisfy regulators and to sell its existing inventory. Apple asked the full commission to delay any possible import ban by that long if the commission reverses the judge\u2019s decisions.  In a filing late on Friday, Qualcomm argued that Apple\u2019s disclosure of a fix undermined the reasoning in Pender\u2019s decision and that the Intel-chipped phones should be banned while Apple deploys its fix.  \u201cPender recommended against a remedy on the assumption that the (Qualcomm) patent would preclude Apple from using Intel as a supplier for many years and that no redesign was feasible,\u201d Qualcomm wrote. \u201cApple now admits\u2014more than seven months after the hearing\u2014that the alleged harm is entirely avoidable.\u201d","70":"Feb 8 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc said on Thursday its board had unanimously rejected Broadcom Ltd\u2019s revised $121 billion buyout offer.

REUTERS\/Pichi Chuang\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Taiwan-based chip supplier MediaTek Inc on Wednesday released a new 5G chip for fast, high-end smartphones that aims to take on much larger rival Qualcomm Inc.  MediaTek is best know for making chips that go into smart speaker devices such as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Echo units and for making the chips inside the more basic Android phones. Qualcomm\u2019s older chips also find their way into some of those low-priced phones, but the San Diego company is better known for supplying high-powered chips to more expensive Android phones such as Google\u2019s Pixel.  With a new chip unveiled at the Computex trade show in Taiwan, MediaTek is targeting the more powerful phones currently supplied by Qualcomm. The chip will contain MediaTek\u2019s 5G modem, which connects phones to the next generation of wireless data networks rolling out this year and next.  MediaTek\u2019s new chip combines that modem with the latest processor core technology from Softbank Group Corp-owned Arm Holdings. By building in high-powered processors, as well as computing cores for things like artificial intelligence, MediaTek is seeking to challenge Qualcomm\u2019s market dominance.  However, Qualcomm has a head start. In February, it announced its second-generation 5G chip for smartphones.  Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd are also developing 5G chips, supplying their own phones. Intel Corp, which had been supplying modems for Apple Inc\u2019s iPhone, said it would exit the 5G modem business after Apple inked a chip supply deal with Qualcomm in April.  Qualcomm\u2019s chip also handles the two variants of 5G networks, so-called sub-6 and millimeter wave bands. That means that phones using its chip will work on any carrier\u2019s 5G networks.  MediaTek\u2019s chip, by contrast, currently handles only sub-6 variants of 5G networks. That helps keep its costs down, MediaTek officials said. But it also means it will not work on all 5G networks from carriers such as Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc that use millimeter wave technology.  Russ Mestechkin, MediaTek\u2019s senior director of sales and business development for the U.S. and Latin America, told Reuters the company was confident its chip could compete in the market for phones designed to work on networks that only use sub-6 technology, such as those from Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc in the United States and many Chinese networks.","73":"(Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O sought again to soothe U.S. security concerns around its bid for chipmaker Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O on Wednesday, saying it would stick with investments aimed at maintaining the United States' leadership in 5G technology.

CFIUS delayed a shareholder meeting that had threatened to hand Broadcom control of the Qualcomm board and, among other things, said lower R&D spending would weaken U.S.-based Qualcomm against Chinese companies.  Here are the important events that have taken place since Broadcom made its first bid to buy Qualcomm:  March 6, 2018  CFIUS identified potential risks that warrant a full investigation of Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm, a senior U.S. Treasury official said in a letter to the companies.  Some of the U.S. government\u2019s concerns relate to risks associated with Broadcom\u2019s relationships with foreign entities, Aimen Mir, the Treasury\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for investment security, said in the letter, without identifying who those parties might be.  The letter, dated March 5, was made public by Qualcomm on Tuesday.  Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm is in talks to settle a patent dispute with China's Huawei Technologies Co HWT.UL and could reach an agreement in the coming weeks, citing people familiar with the matter.  March 5, 2018  Broadcom said the decision by CFIUS to review the deal was the result of secret moves made by Qualcomm on Jan. 29 to encourage an investigation into the offer.  Qualcomm said in a statement that it was delaying its 2018 annual meeting to April 5 as a result of the CFIUS order.  Separately, Qualcomm, which is awaiting China's MOFCOM approval for the $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O, extended the tender offer to March 9 from March 5.  March 4, 2018  The U.S. government ordered the national security review of Broadcom Ltd\u2019s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm that prompted Qualcomm to delay its March 6 shareholder meeting.  March 2, 2018  Broadcom, seeking to buy rival Qualcomm, was planning to complete its move back to the United States by mid-May, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.  Wrapping up the move from Singapore and redomiciling in the United States relatively quickly could remove a roadblock to Broadcom\u2019s proposed deal by calming concerns at the national security panel, CFIUS.  Feb. 27, 2018  CFIUS began looking at Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom\u2019s plan to take over rival Qualcomm, Reuters reported, citing three sources familiar with the matter.  Feb. 26, 2018  Qualcomm appears to warm to Broadcom\u2019s advances by saying the sides have grown closer on regulatory issues and called for talks on price after Broadcom\u2019s latest $117 billion offer. The war of words continued, however, as Broadcom called its U.S. semiconductor peer\u2019s proposal to negotiate a higher price \u201cengagement theater\u201d.  Feb. 21, 2018  Broadcom cut its bid for Qualcomm by $3 to $79 per share after Qualcomm raises its offer for NXP Semiconductors.  Feb. 20, 2018  Qualcomm deals a blow to Broadcom\u2019s raised bid by increasing its offer for NXP Semiconductors to $127.50 per share in cash from $110.  Feb. 14, 2018  Representatives of Broadcom and Qualcomm meet for the first time to discuss a potential combination; Qualcomm later calls the meeting \u201cconstructive\u201d.  Feb. 13, 2018  Broadcom scales back its challenge to Qualcomm\u2019s board by cutting the number of board seats it was trying to win to six from 11, following a meeting with proxy advisory firm ISS.  Feb. 8, 2018  Qualcomm rejects Broadcom\u2019s revised buyout offer of $121 bln, but proposes meeting to address the bid\u2019s \u201cserious deficiencies in value and certainty\u201d.  Feb. 5, 2018  Broadcom raises its offer for Qualcomm to $82 per share from $70 per share, calling the bid its \u201cbest and final offer\u201d.  The revised offer is contingent on either Qualcomm acquiring NXP Semiconductors for $38 billion or the NXP deal being terminated.  Jan. 17, 2018  The Federal Trade Commission investigates whether Broadcom engaged in anticompetitive tactics in negotiations with customers, casting further doubts on regulatory approval for potential deals.  Dec. 22, 2017  Qualcomm rejects Broadcom and private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners\u2019 11 director nominees, setting the stage for a proxy battle.  Dec. 4 , 2017  Broadcom makes its first formal move toward a hostile bid to take over Qualcomm by nominating 11 directors to its rival\u2019s board.

Qualcomm said it now has signed 35 customers to its 5G licensing program and expects the business to generate between $1 billion and $1.1 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, roughly in line with analyst expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  That licensing revenue is \u201cslightly disappointing, but most were well aware of weakness in the handset market, so will be forgiven,\u201d said Christopher Rolland, an analyst with Susquehanna International Group. He said the Huawei deal was a \u201cstep in the right direction,\u201d though it was not yet final.  Legal worries around the company\u2019s licensing division have weighed heavily on Qualcomm over the past two years as it wages a costly and broad-ranging dispute with iPhone maker Apple Inc and government regulators.  In the fiscal first quarter, Qualcomm\u2019s modem chip shipments fell 21.5 percent to 186 million, but were better than analysts estimate of 185.4 million, according to FactSet.  Qualcomm said it expects current-quarter revenue of between $4.4 billion and $5.2 billion, meeting analysts\u2019 estimate of $4.80 billion at the midpoint, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cThe revenue outlook reflects the weakness of the smartphone trends in the March quarter, but we think Qualcomm might see catalysts from initial 5G smartphone launches,\u201d said Jun Zhang, managing director of Rosenblatt Securities.  Net income attributable to Qualcomm was $1.07 billion, or 87 cents per share, for the first quarter ended Dec. 30, compared with a loss of $5.98 billion, or $4.05 per share, a year earlier when it took a $6 billion tax charge.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.20 per share, topping the analyst average estimate of $1.09.  Revenue fell 20 percent to $4.84 billion, slightly missing the analyst average estimate of $4.90 billion.","79":"(Adds Nestle; Updates L\u2019Oreal)  Feb 9 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2200 GMT on Friday:  ** Qualcomm Inc warned on Friday it could lose two large clients if it accepted chipmaker Broadcom Ltd\u2019s revised $121 billion buyout offer and said it saw \u201cno next step\u201d for regulatory approval of any deal.  ** Nestle said that it has bought a majority stake in Terrafertil, a company selling natural and organic plant based foods.  ** French carmaker and Peugeot-owner PSA has agreed to buy a controlling stake in Chinese automotive spare parts distributor Jian Xin, with PSA looking to improve its performance in the lucrative Chinese market.  ** Spanish engineering and renewable energy company Acciona and Britain\u2019s Contour Global are in talks about a possible deal for the Spanish company\u2019s solar power plants, the companies said separately.  ** British business travel company Hogg Robinson Group said American Express Global Business Travel (GBT) made a recommended offer for the company and that it agreed to sell its payments technology business, Fraedom, to Visa Inc.  ** Daily Mirror publisher Trinity Mirror scooped up titles including the Daily Express, Daily Star and OK! magazine for 127 million pounds ($177 million) in the biggest shake up of Britain\u2019s cut-throat newspaper industry in decades.  ** Investment firm Kinnevik said it will do all in its power to see the deal between Tele2 and Com Hem through, after proposing a raised dividend for 2017.  ** Bank of China (BOC) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) are among suitors looking at a potential purchase of German transport finance lender DVB Bank, three sources familiar with the matter say.  ** L\u2019Oreal underscored its readiness to buy Nestle\u2019s 23 percent stake in the world\u2019s biggest cosmetics firm were its Swiss shareholder to sell, saying it had access to cash and funding at its disposal.  ** British engineering group GKN could allow investors more time to decide on a hostile takeover offer by turnaround specialist Melrose, because the U.S., which is a big customer, has a say in whether any deal can proceed.

FILE PHOTO: A booth of U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm is pictured at an expo in Beijing, China, September 27, 2017. Picture taken September 27, 2017. REUTERS\/Stringer  China\u2019s commerce ministry has been asked to speed up the review of the deal and Qualcomm\u2019s proposed remedies to protect local companies, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  The report said local firms are concerned that the deal would extend Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing business into areas such as mobile payments and autonomous driving.  Shares of Qualcomm rose as much as 4.7 percent in early trading.  The U.S. chipmaker, which announced its bid for NXP in October 2016, raised it in February to $127.50 per share and in return received binding agreements from nine NXP stockholders including hedge funds Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd and Soroban Capital Partners LP, who had led the opposition to the deal.  Clinching the biggest deal in the semiconductor sector is crucial to Qualcomm, which is seeking to diversify its customer base and become the leading chip supplier to the fast-growing automotive market.  Qualcomm has already received approval from eight of the nine required global regulators to finalize the acquisition. Chinese clearance is the only one pending, with regulators continually stalling the takeover amid U.S.-China trade tensions.  In April, Qualcomm refiled its application for the deal, giving regulators more time to decide.  The Chinese commerce ministry later that month said Qualcomm needs to do more to complete the takeover as the U.S. company\u2019s initial set of remedies to resolve competition issues were insufficient.  Analysts expect the deal to get approval after President Donald Trump on Sunday pledged to help ZTE Corp 0763.HK000063.SZ get \"back into business\" and save Chinese jobs after a U.S. ban hurt the Chinese telecom equipment maker.  \u201cThe most \u2018logical\u2019 thing for China to do was to (eventually) approve the deal, but to extract as much as possible out of Qualcomm in the process,\u201d Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a client note.  Approval of the deal is not definite and still could be delayed, the Bloomberg report said, citing the sources.  \u201cShould this happen it would benefit Lumentum, Qualcomm, NXP and Marvell Technology,\u201d analyst Jun Zhang of Rosenblatt Securities said.  Lumentum\u2019s $1.7 bilion bid to buy optical components producer Oclaro and chipmaker Marvell\u2019s bid to acquire Cavium in a $6 billion deal are also awaiting Chinese antitrust approval.  The Bloomberg report did not say who asked the ministry to speed up the review, or what Qualcomm has proposed.  \u201cWith regard to matters related to the proposed acquisition of NXP by Qualcomm, we encourage you to get in touch with Qualcomm,\u201d NXP said in an email.  Qualcomm declined to comment.","81":"BEIJING (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O is expecting to meet this week in Beijing with China's antitrust regulators in a final push to secure clearance for its proposed $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O, three sources told Reuters.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The acquisition has been caught in the crosshairs of rising U.S.-China trade tensions, with sources saying an approval would depend on the progress of broader bilateral talks. The deal has got a nod from eight of the nine required global regulators, with Chinese clearance the only one pending.  Qualcomm is likely to meet Chinese regulators before U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross arrives in China on Saturday, the sources briefed on Qualcomm\u2019s discussions said.  A Qualcomm team and officials from the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) met in Beijing on Friday and had \u201cproductive\u201d talks, the sources said.  The San Diego-based firm is now \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d the deal will go forward, one of the sources said, amid recent indications of a thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions that has seen both sides propose tens of billions of dollars in tariffs.  On Friday, the Trump administration said it had reached a deal that would put ZTE Corp 000063.SZ0763.HK back in business after the Chinese telecommunications company pays a $1.3 billion fine and makes management changes.  Resolving the ZTE sales ban has been of chief importance to China\u2019s leadership. The firm was banned in April from buying U.S. technology components for seven years after breaking an agreement it reached for violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea.  \u201cIt feels as though it\u2019s getting close to the end,\u201d said the source quoted above.  Qualcomm did not immediately reply to an email from Reuters seeking comment on Sunday, while calls to NXP went unanswered outside regular business hours.  NEW SUBMISSION  Qualcomm is now preparing a new submission to SAMR aimed at providing final guarantees and assurances, the sources said.  China\u2019s market regulator did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment outside of business hours.  While there are no explicit ties between ZTE\u2019s problems, Sino-U.S. trade tensions and Qualcomm-NXP merger clearance, there are \u201cperceived linkages\u201d and the timing of current discussions is \u201cnot coincidental\u201d, two of the sources said.  \u201cThe degree to which the two sides are moving to resolve trade tensions clearly has an impact,\u201d one source said.  Qualcomm in recent weeks has moved to restart discussions that have stalled since the end of last year.  The company in April was forced to refile its China anti-trust application to clear the NXP deal, after talks reached a dead end.  Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm\u2019s president, was in China last week, attending a big data industry expo in the southwest province of Guizhou.  Earlier this month, China\u2019s anti-trust regulator approved Qualcomm\u2019s investment with a unit of state-owned Datang Telecom Technology Co. to design, package and test smartphone chipsets, one year after the joint venture was announced.","82":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc has broadened its use of a lower-cost licensing model for the next generation of mobile data networks, a move that could help in contentious talks with two customers including iPhone maker Apple Inc, the wireless tech company\u2019s patent licensing chief said on Monday.  FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The patent business traditionally has supplied much of Qualcomm\u2019s profit but has also spurred conflict with Apple, Samsung Electronics Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd as well as regulators in China, South Korea and the United States.  New deals could lower the licensing rate that Qualcomm receives while making the business more dependable if regulators view the terms favourably and two major customers - Apple and a company widely believed to be Huawei - resolve their disputes and resume paying Qualcomm.  \u201cIt\u2019s a good context for dealing with the two licensee issues we have now,\u201d Alex Rogers, the head of Qualcomm\u2019s licensing division, told Reuters in an interview, naming Apple but leaving Huawei unnamed as is the company\u2019s policy when a dispute hasn\u2019t become public through a court proceeding.  Rogers did not comment directly on the likelihood of resolving either customer dispute. Apple and Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Qualcomm sells chips for mobile phones but has a second, much older business licensing technology for wireless networks. The licensing business has generated global controversy and resulted in billions of dollars in regulatory fines, some of which remain on appeal.  Handset makers can licence one of two sets of Qualcomm patents: The full suite that costs makers about 5 percent of the cost of a handset or a smaller set of so-called \u201cstandard essential patents\u201d for 3.25 percent, which includes only the patents needed for gear to work on mobile data networks.  In the past, most of Qualcomm\u2019s customers licensed both sets of patents to avoid lawsuits. But Qualcomm has been defusing tensions by making it easier for customers to licence just the smaller, lower-cost set of standard patents and by adding patents for the next generation 5G wireless network to the suite at no additional cost.  That essentially extends a 2015 settlement with China\u2019s chief antitrust regulator. Qualcomm began to licence only its standard patents for 3G and 4G networks to Chinese handset makers for a rate of 3.25 percent. More than 100 device makers have signed on for such deals.  \u201cWe have not lowered the rate. What we\u2019re doing is including more technology, more (intellectual property) in the offering without increasing the price,\u201d Rogers added.  Qualcomm also announced last week that it would assess its patent fees against only the first $400 (\u00a3291) of a phone\u2019s net selling price. Rogers said the previous price cap was $500, a figure that was well known among industry insiders but that Qualcomm did not make public.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is creating a foundation for stability going forward,\u201d Rogers said, describing Qualcomm\u2019s 5G licensing moves as \u201cregulator friendly\u201d.  The question now is whether more handset makers will opt for Qualcomm\u2019s lower-cost standard patents rather than its pricier full portfolio.  \u201cWhat we perceive here is there will be more of a mix than there was in the past of companies opting for (standard essential patents) only,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cHow much more, depends on each individual company.\u201d  While Qualcomm has made no public disclosures about the status of talks with the two major customers in licence disputes, the company\u2019s approach to licensing patents for upcoming 5G networks will look different than its initial approaches for 3G and 4G networks of years past.  \u201cBoth of those issues (disputes) are essentially now being handled within the framework of the current programme we\u2019re offering,\u201d Rogers said.","83":"LONDON\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has blocked microchip maker Broadcom Ltd's AVGO.O $117 billion takeover of rival Qualcomm QCOM.O amid concerns that it would give China the upper hand in the next generation of mobile communications, or 5G.  A 5G sign is seen at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Yves Herman  Below are some facts about 5G and major players.  WHAT IS 5G?  5G networks, now in the final testing stage, will rely on denser arrays of small antennas and the cloud to offer data speeds up to 50 or 100 times faster than current 4G networks and serve as critical infrastructure for a range of industries.  Deals to start building mass-market 5G networks are still largely a year away, but by 2025, 1.2 billion people are set to have access to 5G networks - a third of them in China, according to the global wireless trade group GSMA.  Moving to new networks promises to enable new mobile services and even whole new business models, but could pose challenges for countries and industries unprepared to invest in the transition.  Unlike the upgrades of cellular standards 2G in the early 1990s, 3G around the millennium and 4G in 2010, 5G standards will deliver not just faster phone and computer data but also help connect up cars, machines, cargo and crop equipment.  WHY IS THE U.S. WORRIED?  The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets acquisitions of U.S. corporations by foreign companies, said the Broadcom takeover risked weakening Qualcomm, which would boost China over the United States in the 5G race.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Acquiring Qualcomm would represent the jewel in the crown of Broadcom\u2019s portfolio of communications chips, which supply wi-fi, power management, video and other features in smartphones alongside Qualcomm\u2019s core baseband chips - radio modems that wirelessly connect phones to networks.  The concern is that a takeover by Singapore-based Broadcom could see the firm cut research and development spending by Qualcomm or hive off strategically important parts of the company to other buyers, including in China, U.S. officials and analysts have said.  5G promises to open up the clubby world of telecom equipment by creating openings for a far wider range of players in hardware, software and semiconductors, many of them from Asia, increasing the dependence of Silicon Valley on foreign players.  MAJOR PLAYERS  Before the new technology becomes a reality for consumers, two transitions need to take place.  Mobile operators have to upgrade their networks with 5G gear made by the likes of Huawei [HWT.UL] and ZTE 0000630.SZ of China, Sweden's Ericsson ERICb.ST and Finland's Nokia NOKIA.HE. And phone makers need to make handsets with built-in 5G radios ready to hook up to networks.  Qualcomm QCOM.O is the dominant player in smartphone communications chips, making half of all core baseband radio chips in smartphones. It is one of the last big U.S. technology companies with a major role in mobile communications hardware.  Most other baseband chips come from Asia: MediaTek 2454.TW of Taiwan holds about one quarter of the market, while Samsung Electronics 005930.KS and Huawei [HWT.UL] - two big smartphone makers - develop chips for their own devices. Huawei does through a subsidiary known as HiSilicon.  Its dominant position in 5G comes from its mastery of two areas: getting its patents adopted in what are known as standards and then selling the chip designs that work with those standards.  The standards are set by a global body to ensure all phones work across different mobile networks, and whoever\u2019s essential patents end up making it into the standard stands to reap huge royalty licensing revenue streams.  Qualcomm has landed a number of these foundational patents, which means that both handset makers and telecommunications gear makers will have to pay it licensing fees. It dominated standards setting in 3G and 4G wireless and looks set to top the list of patent holders heading into the 5G cycle.  Huawei, Nokia, Ericsson and others are also vying to amass 5G patents, which has helped spur complex cross-licensing agreements like the deal struck late last year Nokia and Huawei around handsets.","84":"May 18 (Reuters) -  * BEIJING OFFICIAL SAYS QUALCOMM-NXP DEAL LOOKING MORE OPTIMISTIC NOW - CNBC, CITING DJ Further company coverage:","85":"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday reversed a lower court ruling against chip supplier Qualcomm Inc in an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission.  FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is seen at the second China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, China November 6, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals also vacated an injunction that would have required Qualcomm to change its intellectual property licensing practices.  The decision was a major vindication for the San Diego-based company, the largest supplier of chips for mobile phones and a key generator of wireless communications technology.  Qualcomm was fighting a May 2019 decision by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California. Koh sided with the FTC, writing that Qualcomm\u2019s practice of requiring phone makers to sign a patent license agreement before selling them chips \u201cstrangled competition\u201d and harmed consumers.  But the appeals court, in a 3-0 ruling written by Circuit Judge Consuelo Callahan, ruled that Qualcomm had no duty to license its patents to rival chip suppliers and that it was not anticompetitive to require phone makers to sign a license agreement.  \u201cInstead, these aspects of Qualcomm\u2019s business model are \u2018chip-supplier neutral\u2019 and do not undermine competition in the relevant antitrust markets,\u201d Callahan wrote.  Qualcomm praised the decision while the FTC called it \u201cdisappointing.\u201d  \u201cThe Court of Appeals unanimous reversal, entirely vacating the District Court decision, validates our business model and patent licensing program and underscores the tremendous contributions that Qualcomm has made to the industry,\u201d Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s general counsel, said in statement.  The FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition director, Ian Conner, said in a statement, that the agency \u201cwill be considering our options.\u201d  The case divided U.S. antitrust regulators with the Justice Department intervening to file a brief in support of Qualcomm.  The Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Qualcomm shares rose about 4% on the news. The shares have been up from March lows as the company continued to show growth despite a sluggish smart phone market.  Qualcomm had argued that the FTC decision, if allowed to stand, would upend its business model by requiring it for the first time to license its technology to rival chipmakers and rework many of its patent licensing deals with phone makers.  Qualcomm won a pause in enforcement of the decision while its legal appeal played out and voluntarily changed how it structured some of its licensing deals for 5G technology. With the appeals victory and raft of new agreements signed with customers since the case was decided, Qualcomm is largely clear to resume conducting business as it had for decades before the FTC case.  Qualcomm\u2019s business model often prompted conflict with phone makers, most notably Apple Inc, which supported the FTC\u2019s case and mounted a separate antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm.  The phone makers bristled at Qualcomm\u2019s insistence that manufacturers license its broad patent portfolio regardless of whose chips they chose.  Apple settled its case against Qualcomm in 2018 and signed a license deal and chip supply agreement. Other major phone makers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd have also settled disputes with the chip supplier and signed license deals since the FTC case was decided.","86":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK said on Monday they will cooperate on projects that could include making the Chinese company's videogames play better on devices with Qualcomm chips, and create a 5G version of a Tencent-backed gaming phone.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Qualcomm is the largest supplier of mobile phone chips that power many Android devices. With a market capitalization of about $453 billion, Tencent is China\u2019s largest mobile software company, and owns WeChat, the nearly ubiquitous social network.  Tencent, among the world\u2019s largest gaming companies, reported sharply lower profits last year after the Chinese government stopped approving games for several months. Tencent received permission to launch major title Perfect World Mobile in the January-March quarter.  Under the agreement, future Tencent games could be \u201coptimized\u201d for Android phones that run Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon Elite gaming chips, the companies said in a statement.  They have already worked together on a gaming phone. Earlier this month, Tencent paired with Asustek Computer Inc's 2357.TW gaming device division, Republic of Games, to introduce a gaming phone with a Qualcomm chip.  Tencent and Qualcomm also plan to jointly develop a 5G version of the gaming phone, which could help bolster Tencent\u2019s plans for a streaming game service.  The faster connection speeds of 5G devices could allow the streaming of more complex games to mobile devices. U.S.-based Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google have also launched streaming game services.  \u201cMobile gaming, an important 5G use case, will soon take advantage of the next generation of connectivity,\u201d Qualcomm China Chairman Frank Meng said in the statement.  \u201cFaster speeds, more bandwidth, and cutting edge ultra-low latency will support real-time, multi-player and immersive gaming experience.\u201d  Tencent is working on a cloud-based back-end service called Instant Play that game developers could use to power streaming games. Microsoft is offering a similar service in its Azure cloud computing service.  Tencent has not revealed plans for its consumer-facing streaming service, but many analysts expect one.  The cooperation agreement could also include tweaking game titles for U.S. laptops powered by Qualcomm\u2019s processors and connected to the Internet via 5G, rather than more traditional Wi-Fi chips.

FILE PHOTO: Signs of Qualcomm and 5G are pictured at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Shanghai, China June 28, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song  Fifth-generation chipsets from Qualcomm, the world's biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, now run on five devices from Samsung Electronics 005930.KS, including the $1,299 Galaxy S10 5G model and the new $2,000 Galaxy Fold.  Samsung, the world\u2019s top smartphone seller, has also put Qualcomm chips in its lower-priced A90 5G model, which had used Samsung chips in an earlier version.  Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon predicted such devices would achieve volume and scale.  \u201cThe transition to 5G is going to be faster than earlier transitions,\u201d Amon told Reuters on the sidelines of the IFA consumer electronics fair in Berlin. \u201cNow we have to bring it to everyone.\u201d  More than 20 network operators and a similar number of smartphone makers - from the United States to Europe to China - are launching 5G services and handsets. Amon estimated there were 2.2 billion mobile users that could upgrade.  Such bullishness contrasts with the challenges faced by China\u2019s Huawei Technologies, the No.2 smartphone seller behind Samsung that also unveiled its 5G chipset at IFA.  Huawei\u2019s consumer business chief Richard Yu touted the Kirin 990 chipset at IFA as the \u201cmost powerful\u201d and superior to Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 series.  Due to U.S. trade sanctions, Huawei\u2019s 5G-ready Mate 30 smartphone range to be launched on Sept. 19 could be hobbled because it won\u2019t be able to run the official version of Google\u2019s Android operating system and app services.  MASS APPEAL  Until now, Qualcomm typically supplied 5G chips from its most expensive line, Snapdragon 8, which on Friday was showcased with a more powerful X55 5G modem delivering speeds of up to 7 gigabits per second.  It now plans to add 5G capabilities to lower-cost Snapdragon 6 and 7 series devices, which could make 5G phones available more cheaply than the current mostly premium models.  Qualcomm's 6 and 7 series Snapdragon chips are found in devices from Lenovo Group Ltd's 0992.HK Motorola, Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK, Oppo and Vivo that retail in the $300 range.  Analysts say faster 5G networks will spur many consumers to upgrade their phones after years of market stagnation, although 5G devices are coming to some markets before networks are completed.  \u201cQualcomm have done a phenomenal job to drive the 5G ecosystem,\u201d said industry analyst Paolo Pescatore. \u201cIt\u2019s going faster than anyone could have ever imagined.\u201d  That puts a premium for Qualcomm on partnering with carriers to market new devices. It\u2019s typical for operators to market subsidized handsets in the United States, but less so in Europe.  In Germany, Deutsche Telekom DTEGn.DE switched on its 5G network in five cities this week, marketing the Snapdragon-powered Samsung Galaxy S10 5G to early adopters.  FULL SPECTRUM  Qualcomm was early to market 5G modem chips to connect phones to networks but faces intense competition. Taiwan-based MediaTek Inc 2454.TW also announced a 5G smartphone chip this year.  Qualcomm is positioning itself to be compatible with the full range of frequencies deployed by regulators to run 5G.  These include so-called \u2018sub-6\u2019, or spectrum below 6 Gigahertz that has been predominantly auctioned by European governments making an early start on the shift to 5G.  The United States has auctioned more millimeter wave frequencies with a shorter range but higher data-carrying capacity needed to realize the full range of uses of 5G, such as autonomous driving.  Unlike rivals, Qualcomm is designing its chipsets to handle frequencies \u201cfrom A to Z\u201d, said Amon, adding that flexibility to switch between 4G networks and new 5G networks was critical.  Chips from Mediatek can only handle sub-6 bands, reducing the cost and complexity of the chips and phone designs.  But it means the phones cannot take full advantage of networks from U.S. carriers such as Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N and AT&T Inc T.N that use millimeter wave technology.","89":"April 17 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc:  * QUALCOMM ANNOUNCES QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND  * SETS QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.62PER SHARE  * NEW DIVIDEND RATE REPRESENTS A 9% INCREASE ABOVE PRIOR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","90":"SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The lead attorney for the group of Apple Inc device assemblers seeking at least $9 billion in damages from Qualcomm Inc said on Sunday the contract manufacturers are not in settlement talks with the mobile chip supplier and are \u201cgearing up and heading toward the trial\u201d in April.  The conflict is but one aspect of the global legal battle between regulators, Apple and Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips that help phones connect to wireless data networks.  Last week, Qualcomm secured a preliminary victory in a patent lawsuit in China that forced Apple to change its software for iPhones in that country or else face a ban on selling phones there.  But Qualcomm was also handed another setback in an antitrust lawsuit brought against it by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission when a judge said it will not be able to mention that Apple ditched Qualcomm chips for competing ones from Intel Corp when the case goes to trial next month.  The group of contract manufacturers - which includes Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp and Compal Electronics Inc - became embroiled in the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm last year.  In the supply chain for electronics, it is the contract manufacturers who buy Qualcomm\u2019s chips and pay royalties when they build phones, and they are in turn reimbursed by companies like Apple. Qualcomm sued the group last year, alleging they had stopped paying royalties related to Apple products, and Apple joined their defense.  The contract manufacturers have since filed claims of their own against Qualcomm, alleging the San Diego company\u2019s practice of charging money for chips but then also asking for a cut of the adjusted selling price of a mobile phone as a patent royalty payment constitutes an anticompetitive business practice. The manufacturers are seeking $9 billion in damages from Qualcomm for royalties they allege were illegal. That figure could triple if the manufacturers succeed on their antitrust claims.  Ted Boutrous, a high-profile partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP who is representing the contract manufacturers, said statements from Qualcomm executives suggesting there were meaningful settlement talks with the contract manufacturers were \u201cfalse.\u201d  \u201cTo the extent Qualcomm has indicated there have been licensing discussions with the contract manufacturers, they\u2019ve basically made the same sort of unreasonable demands that got them to where they are right now, which impose significant preconditions to even discuss a new arrangement,\u201d Boutrous told Reuters on Sunday.  In July, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, told investors on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call that Qualcomm and Apple itself were in talks to resolve the litigation. Last month, a source familiar with Apple\u2019s legal strategy told Reuters there were \u201cabsolutely no meaningful discussion taking place between us and Qualcomm, and there is no settlement in sight.\u201d (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; editing by Chris Reese)","91":"April 19 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc:  * QUALCOMM AND NXP AGREE, AT MOFCOM REQUEST, TO WITHDRAW AND REFILE APPLICATION FOR CHINESE REGULATORY APPROVAL  * QUALCOMM AND NXP AGREE, AT MOFCOM REQUEST, TO WITHDRAW AND REFILE APPLICATION FOR CHINESE REGULATORY APPROVAL  * QUALCOMM INC - NXP, QUALCOMM RIVER HOLDINGS AGREED TO EXTEND END DATE OF THEIR PURCHASE AGREEMENT FROM APRIL 25, 2018 TO JULY 25, 2018  * QUALCOMM - PENDING TENDER OFFER OF QUALCOMM RIVER HOLDINGS B.V.

REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage  Under the deal, Qualcomm will release a set of chips that any maker of Bluetooth headphones can use to embed Alexa directly into the device. When the headphones are paired to a phone with the Alexa app on it, users will be able to talk to the voice assistant by tapping a button on the headphones.  The functionality would be similar to Apple Inc's AAPL.O AirPods wireless earbuds, which enable users can tap the devices to talk to Apple's virtual assistant, Siri.  Amazon and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, whose voice assistants have most often been found in their respective smart speakers for the home, are rushing to partner with headphone makers.  Models from Bose Corp and Jabra feature Alexa built in, and Sony Corp 6758.T said earlier this year that a software update will make some of its headphone models work with Alexa. Google Assistant can be used on headphones from Bose, JBL and Sony, along with Google's own Pixel Buds.  The Qualcomm partnership could expand that lineup. Qualcomm has developed a pre-made circuit that headphone makers can drop into their device to imbue it with Alexa.  \u201cThis radically reduces their [engineering] cost and time to market,\u201d Anthony Murray, senior vice president and general manager of voice and music for Qualcomm, told Reuters in an interview. \u201cIt makes it simple for the industry to adopt this.\u201d  Murray declined to comment on whether Qualcomm would make a similar offering for Google Assistant but said the chip firm plans to support other partners in the future.  The move is part of a broader push by Qualcomm to diversify away from its dependence on processor and modem chips for mobile phones. That business proved lucrative for Qualcomm, but its patent licensing model drew regulatory fines and lawsuits from customers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O.  At a conference in Hong Kong slated for early Tuesday local time, Qualcomm also said it is working with action camera maker GoPro Inc GPRO.O to put more Qualcomm chips for image processing in the devices. The firm has said it expects about $5 billion in revenue from non-mobile sources this year, or more than 20 percent of the $22.4 billion in sales that analysts expect.","93":"SHANGHAI\/BEIJING (Reuters) - A move by the United States to ban American firms selling components to the Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp will also hit a target closer to home: Qualcomm Inc, a U.S. company that is a major supplier of chips for ZTE\u2019s phones.  The U.S. Department of Commerce slapped a seven-year ban on sales to ZTE on Monday for breaking terms of an agreement reached last year after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran.  Caught in the crossfire is Qualcomm, whose products account for the lion\u2019s share of chips inside ZTE smartphones. The Chinese company shipped an estimated 46.4 million phones last year, according to IHS Markit.  \u201cIf you look at ZTE it sells around 45 million smartphones per year globally, and almost half of them have Qualcomm chips,\u201d said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research.  \u201cSo if you look at an average of 25 dollars per chip set that\u2019s close to half a billion dollars in revenue.\u201d  Canalys, a technology consultancy, estimate that a higher 65 percent of ZTE phones contain Qualcomm chips.  Loss of business could be just the start for the U.S. company, which had sales of $22 billion last year. As Washington and Beijing square off with threats of tariffs and trade barriers, Qualcomm is a clear target for retaliation.  Technology is the crux of the tensions.  China wants to boost domestic champions like Huawei, which also makes chips. The United States, meanwhile, concerned about China\u2019s growing might, has shot down Chinese technology deals overseas, citing national security concerns.  A booth of U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm is pictured at an expo in Beijing, China, September 27, 2017. Picture taken September 27, 2017. REUTERS\/Stringer  That puts Qualcomm, which makes the bulk of its sales in China, in an awkward position.  \u201cDomestically there are competing attitudes: for someone like Huawei, Qualcomm is the enemy,\u201d said Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China and North Asia at Control Risks. \u201cBut for many smaller Chinese phone makers they are actually very dependent on Qualcomm.\u201d  SNAPDRAGON  Qualcomm, which has government and defense contracts at home, is closely tied to the United States government; it is also grappling with regulator approval in China for a $44 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors.  It may, ironically, get hit by the ZTE issues more in the United States than in China.  ZTE, while China\u2019s second-largest telecommunication equipment maker, has dropped out of the top ten in terms of domestic smartphone sales in recent years, according to Canalys, as rivals such as Huawei, OPPO, Vivo and Xiaomi have surged.  But in the United States it is the fourth largest smartphone vendor after iPhone maker Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics of South Korea.  ZTE held 11.2 percent of the U.S. market last year, according to data from the consultancy Canalys.  Its phones in the United States use chip sets and processors from Qualcomm, according to company specifications on its U.S. website, which showed all its \u201csignature\u201d phones using Qualcomm chip sets such as Snapdragon 820 and Snapdragon 617.  \u201cMost carriers want Qualcomm chip sets in the United States, so basically they are in deep trouble,\u201d said Shah, referring to ZTE. He estimated the United States at close to one fourth of the company\u2019s handset business. \u201cThey\u2019d be losing one of their biggest markets.\u201d  Qualcomm was not immediately available for comment.  TRIPLE THREAT  The ZTE issue could create a triple threat for Qualcomm: the loss of an important customer, rivals bolstered as they step in to fill the vacuum, and a potential hit as China looks to retaliate against the United States.  China\u2019s commerce ministry said Tuesday that it will closely monitor the ZTE case and be prepared to take action to protect the interests of Chinese firms.  The impact of the trade war is already being felt. Qualcomm withdrew, and plans to refile, an antitrust application for its pivotal NXP deal on Saturday at the request of China\u2019s commerce ministry, sources told Reuters.  Qualcomm\u2019s shares dropped 1.7 percent on Monday. Smaller U.S. optical components firms such as the ZTE supplier Acacia Communications fell more steeply.  Counterpoint\u2019s Shah said ZTE could now look to rivals like Samsung, Taiwan\u2019s MediaTek Inc or China\u2019s Spreadtrum for alternative chips. Huawei on Tuesday repeated a long-held policy of not selling its Kirin chips to outside parties.  Shah added, however, that ZTE phones might need expensive redesigns and other chips wouldn\u2019t have the same level of performance: \u201cEither way the costs will be high for ZTE.\u201d","94":"(Reuters) - Kneron Inc, a semiconductor startup backed by venture capital arms of Qualcomm Inc and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, on Thursday announced a new chip aimed at handling artificial intelligence functions on battery-powered devices.  The San Diego, California-based company said the KL720 chip can perform tasks such as image or speech recognition.  Many battery-powered devices, for example, are capable of recognizing a \u201cwake word\u201d for speech commands but then must connect to the internet for full natural language processing. Kneron, pronounced KNEE-RON, said its new chip can hold a dictionary worth of words on the device itself.  Kneron is among a number of companies large and small rushing to handle such tasks on smaller devices such as drones, smart speakers and doorbells. Performing image or speech recognition without connecting to a cloud data center can present fewer privacy concerns and make devices work better when wireless data access is sparse.  Irvine, California-based Syntiant, one of Kneron\u2019s rivals in energy-efficient artificial intelligent chips, said earlier this month that it has shipped 1 million chips and raised $35 million in a funding round from investors including the venture capital arms of Microsoft Corp and Applied Materials Inc, bringing its total raised to $65 million.  Kneron has raised $70 million to date and said its new chip will be available to device makers for testing in the coming weeks.","95":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O on Wednesday forecast fourth-quarter revenue largely above Wall Street expectations, powered by sales of its chips used in 5G devices and reaching a settlement with Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL].  FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is seen at the second China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, China November 6, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  Shares of the company were up as much as 13% in extended trading despite a forecast for fourth-quarter chip revenue slightly lower than analysts expected because of a delayed \u201cflagship phone launch\u201d analyst believe is Apple\u2019s new iPhones.  The company also said it resolved a licensing dispute with Huawei, which will pay Qualcomm a catch-up payment of $1.8 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. While Huawei is still barred from buying Qualcomm\u2019s chips under U.S. regulations, it has now resumed paying licensing fees for wireless technology, Qualcomm said.  After resolving a bruising legal battle with iPhone maker Apple Inc AAPL.O last year, Qualcomm entered 2020 with a deal to resume selling chips to Apple and predicting revenue growth from 5G devices, which fetch higher chip revenue per phone for the company. Qualcomm forecast fourth-quarter chip shipments with a midpoint of 155 million units, slightly below expectations of 159 million units, according to FactSet data.  Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala told Reuters in an interview that Qualcomm expected to make up some of those sales in the fiscal first quarter.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a partial impact from the delay of a flagship phone launch. And so what we\u2019ve seen is a slight delay that pushes some of the units out from the September quarter to the December quarter for us,\u201d he said.  Qualcomm executives did not name the customer, but analyst widely believe it to be Apple.  While Qualcomm has long supplied processors and modems to help phones connect to wireless data networks, it has pushed into also selling radio-frequency chips to help phone makers handle the more complex signals involved in 5G networks.  Palkhiwala said Qualcomm expected to win sales with all major smartphone makers, including the customer facing a delayed flagship launch in the fiscal fourth quarter, though he did not name specific customers. \u201cSuffice to say, I think going forward we expect to be selling to all of them,\u201d he said.  Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, said it expects current-quarter adjusted revenue of between $5.5 billion and $6.3 billion, compared with analysts\u2019 estimates of $5.78 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Qualcomm, which generates most of its profits by licensing its technology to mobile phone makers and others, said licensing revenue in the segment was $1 billion, well above estimates of $851 million, according to FactSet.  Revenue from its chip segment - its largest by sales - was $3.80 billion, compared with estimates of $3.90 billion.  The San Diego-based firm said it shipped 130 million chips capable of wireless data connections, compared with estimates of 134.7 million, according to FactSet data. The shipments put average selling prices for chips at $29.23, lower than the $32 in the previous quarter when the company had released higher-priced flagship chips.","96":"FILE PHOTO: A man works on a tent for NXP Semiconductors at Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. on January 4, 2015.

Activist Elliott first announced a stake in NXP a year ago, launching a campaign to push for a higher price tag in the Qualcomm deal, which drove the bid up from $38 billion.  Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of NXP failed when the Chinese regulator refused to approve the deal by a deadline on June 25.  China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulator said in a statement in Friday that proposals put forth by the firms to resolve antitrust concerns were insufficient, but it hoped to continue communication with Qualcomm.  Elliott reduced its position to 3.5 percent, from 5.5 percent, a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 31 showed. It is no longer NXP\u2019s top shareholder.  An Elliott spokeswoman declined to comment.  Many hedge funds bought into NXP months ago in a bet the deal would succeed but investors and analysts had pointed to reasons to hold on to the stock.  Shares in NXP fell more than 6 percent after the deal collapsed but have since regained around 3 percent.","97":"* Collapse of $44 bln tie-up hits merger-arb funds  * Takes shine off strong start to 2018 for strategy  LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - Hedge funds betting Qualcomm would succeed in a $44 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors face steep losses after the deal fell through - taking the shine off a strong start to the year for many funds.  Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, called off the deal on Thursday after the Chinese regulator failed to approve it by a Wednesday deadline.  Many funds bought into NXP months ago at an average of around $115 a share, well below the $127.5 a share offer price, a trader at a major investment bank told Reuters, but rising U.S. China trade tensions caused a steady slide in the value of the target.  After closing at $98.37 on Wednesday, ahead of the deadline, shares in NXP were down more than 7 percent early on Thursday. From Wednesday\u2019s close to Thursday, the estimated paper loss based on the share price movement would be more than $700 million, based on available Thomson Reuters data.  \u201cIt\u2019s a significant hit but it\u2019s always more palatable for risk-arbitrage to lose money as a slow bleed,\u201d said the trader at the bank. \u201cThe struggle is when you come in and the stock is down 30 percent in one day.\u201d  Which funds held what position at when the deal was called off on Wednesday is hard to determine as U.S. securities filings data has a long lag. It is also impossible to show using publicly available data when they bought and sold, to determine precise losses.  The most recent Thomson Reuters data, however, showed hedge funds made up seven of the top 10 shareholders in NXP, and collectively they held more than 35 percent of its shares.  \u201cA lot of hedge funds are involved in NXP-Qualcomm. We have about five to 10 event-driven managers involved in the trade,\u201d said Ben Watson, senior investment manager, alternatives at Aberdeen Standard Investments.  Three of the seven hedge funds among the top-10 investors cut exposure to NXP ahead of Wednesday, including Soroban Capital Partners, Och-Ziff Capital Management and Pentwater Capital Management, Thomson Reuters data showed.  All of these funds declined to comment to Reuters.  \u201cWe cut our position from near-10 percent of our portfolio in February down to under 5 percent,\u201d said a trader at one of the top-30 hedge funds with a position in NXP.  The losses marred what has been an otherwise strong start to the year for \u2018event-driven\u2019 funds that specialise in trading around deals.  Up 2.26 percent in the first half of 2018, the average fund outperformed average industry returns of 0.79 percent, industry tracker Hedge Fund Research showed.  One of the star contributors to portfolio performance has been Sky, up 52 percent this year as Comcast Corp and Walt Disney Co compete to buy the company.  Also, a number of other China-U.S. deals had successfully completed or were expected to complete which has helped performance, investors said.  Among them were Marvell Technology, which announced it had acquired Cavium on July 6, and Microchip Technology , whose takeover of Microsemi Corp was finalised May 29.  Investors and analysts also pointed to reasons for funds not to sell out of NXP completely.  As a result of cancelling the deal, Qualcomm paid a $2 billion breakup fee to NXP - a fact that should help bolster the share price - while NXP also launched a share buy-back. Olivetree analysts suggested NXP could now hit a standalone price of $120 a share. (Reporting by Maiya Keidan.

Separately, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O said it discontinued the role of executive chairman and named a new non-executive chairman as it seeks to curry favor with shareholders ahead of a proxy fight with Broadcom now slated for April 5.  Qualcomm also said Tom Horton would continue as its lead director. Horton has been a member of the company's board since December 2008, having previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O.  Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm has warped into a complex fight over regulatory approvals, security nerves about China\u2019s influence on global mobile networks and the best way forward financially for one of the world\u2019s dominant chipmakers.

It referred to a statement issued in response to the Dec. 20 ruling in Munich, against which it is appealing.  Apple said at the time that, while a decision on the Munich appeal is outstanding, it would no longer stock the iPhone 7 and 8 at its 15 retail outlets in Germany, although its newer models would remain on sale.  All of its models remain available through carriers and resellers. Gravis, the leading Apple reseller in Germany, said on Tuesday it continued to stock the full range of iPhones.  Apart from the German order, Qualcomm has also secured a ban on the sale of some iPhones in China. Apple, which is also contesting that ruling, has continued to offer its iPhones in China but made changes to its iOS operating system following the order.  Qualcomm, meanwhile, faces a U.S. antitrust case brought by the Federal Trade Commission which accuses it of abusing a monopoly on mobile chip technology in a trial that could have a major impact on the smartphone industry.  If the government prevails in the trial that began on Jan. 4, Qualcomm could be forced to change its practices for licensing a trove of patents to device makers like Apple.  Apple is closely watching the FTC case, as it has its own pending lawsuit making similar claims against Qualcomm.","101":"May 28 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday asked a federal judge not to enforce her decision that it illegally squeezed out rivals in the smartphone chips market as it plans to file an appeal that could take more than a year to wind through the courts.  In a filing in federal court in San Jose, California, Qualcomm said that it believes it can succeed in appealing the May 21 decision by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in an antitrust case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January 2017. The company has not yet filed that appeal; Tuesday\u2019s filing only concerns whether the ruling\u2019s provisions will be put on hold temporarily as it plays out.  Qualcomm argued that Koh\u2019s ruling raised \u201cserious legal questions\u201d because, among other things, she excluded evidence after a March 2018 cutoff date - including the fact that Apple Inc dropped Qualcomm in favor of rival chip supplier Intel Corp, showing that Qualcomm did not have a stranglehold on the market. Qualcomm also said that the FTC\u2019s theory in the lawsuit - that Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices amounted to a \u201ctax\u201d on smart phone makers, generating profits that Qualcomm then put to work undercutting its rivals - was unprecedented in antitrust law.  Qualcomm said Koh\u2019s ruling would force it to rework its license deals and even offer deals to rival chip suppliers, scrambling its business in a way that would be impossible to unwind if it wins on appeal. Qualcomm shares shot up 23% in April when it resolved a legal conflict with Apple but then declined 15% after Koh\u2019s ruling.  \u201cAfter radically restructuring its business relationships, Qualcomm will not be able to return to its pre-injunction business in an orderly fashion,\u201d the company said. \u201cNor will it be able to unwind licensing agreements it has renegotiated in the shadow of an order that is later overturned.\u201d  FTC officials did not immediately return a request for comment.  San Diego-based Qualcomm makes cellphone processors and modem chips, but generates most of its profit by licensing its technology to mobile phone makers.  Koh ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices had \u201cstrangled competition\u201d and directed the company to renegotiate licensing agreements with customers at fair prices without threatening to cut off supplies.  She also ruled that Qualcomm must offer to license its patents on fair terms to rival chipmakers such as MediaTek Inc . Qualcomm currently licenses its patents to device makers. Shifting to licensing to other chip suppliers could reduce Qualcomm\u2019s royalties from as much as $20 per phone to just a few dollars per device.  The judge also said Qualcomm could not enter exclusivity agreements that block rivals from selling chips to smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Koh required Qualcomm to be monitored for seven years to ensure it complied with her remedies.  If Koh reject\u2019s Qualcomm\u2019s request to put the ruling on hold during the appeals process, Qualcomm will then ask the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to do the same. The company\u2019s appeal on the legal merits of the ruling will proceed even if it loses its request to put its provisions on hold as the process plays out.  Qualcomm had argued during a 10-day non-jury trial before Koh in January that it became dominant in the market for smartphone chips through technological leadership, not freezing out rivals.","102":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc can depose Apple Inc\u2019s services chief Eddy Cue in addition to Chief Executive Tim Cook, a magistrate judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California ruled on Friday, part of the chipmaker\u2019s effort to determine whether Apple worked with Samsung to focus regulatory scrutiny on Qualcomm.  Eddy Cue, Senior VP of Internet Software, introduces Apple TV during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  The access to Cue is important because Qualcomm alleges talks between executives at Apple and its rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd were central to its decision to cut off Apple from a stream of nearly $1 billion in licensing rebate payments.  Apple sued Qualcomm early last year, contesting the San Diego-based chipmaker\u2019s licensing practices and asking for those rebate payments back. Qualcomm then sued Apple for patent infringement in several countries. As part of the disputes, Qualcomm is also seeking to ban the import of some iPhones it believes are violating its patents.  In the lawsuit in Southern California filed by Apple, Qualcomm has alleged that at a conference in Idaho in 2015, a top Apple executive encouraged Samsung to \u201cget aggressive\u201d in asking South Korean antitrust regulators to pursue action against the chipmaker.  Cook and Cue are regular attendees of a media mogul conference held each year in Sun Valley, Idaho. The Apple executive in question, Qualcomm alleged, explained that a regulatory ruling on Samsung\u2019s home turf would be Samsung\u2019s \u201cbest chance\u201d to force Qualcomm to change its licensing practices.  Qualcomm did not name the Apple executive cited in its filings. However, the conversation between Apple and Samsung is important because Qualcomm alleges it amounted to Apple \u201cwrongfully inducing\u201d a regulatory action against Qualcomm.  Qualcomm said such a move violated a cooperation agreement it had with Apple and that it stopped sending rebate payments to Apple because of that and other violations of the agreement.  Apple has argued in court filings that it cooperated with requests from regulators and that Qualcomm improperly retaliated against it for doing so.  Though Qualcomm is known as a chipmaker, its profit has been driven by a patent licensing business. Some of Qualcomm\u2019s practices caused conflicts with customers such as Apple and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], as well as with regulators in China, Korea and the United States. Qualcomm has begun changing some of those practices to become more \u201cregulator friendly,\u201d its executives have said.

Filed by Apple in early 2017, the lawsuit in federal court revolves around the modem chips that connect devices like the iPhone or Apple Watch to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has spent the past two years mounting a pressure campaign of smaller legal skirmishes against Apple, seeking - and in some cases obtaining - iPhone sales bans for violating its patents.  The trial before Judge Gonzalo Curiel will play out on Qualcomm\u2019s home turf of San Diego, where for decades the city\u2019s National Football League team played in Qualcomm Stadium and nearly every business district hosts the mobile chip firm\u2019s logo.  For Apple, the trial is about the freedom to determine its own technology path for blockbuster products by buying chips without having to pay what it calls a \u201ctax\u201d on its innovations in the form of patent licensing fees to Qualcomm that take a cut of the selling price of its devices.  For Qualcomm, the trial, along with similar allegations from U.S. regulators in a January court hearing, will determine the fate of its unique blend of selling chips and licensing more than 130,000 patents.  Licensing generates most of Qualcomm profits. The model propelled Qualcomm from a small contract research and development shop when founded in 1985 to a global chip powerhouse important enough to U.S. national security that President Donald Trump personally intervened to prevent a hostile takeover of the company last year.  \u201cThis is the day of reckoning that Qualcomm has been very fortunate to avoid for many years,\u201d said Gaston Kroub, a patent attorney with Kroub, Silbersher & Kolmykov who is not involved in the case. \u201cIn Apple, they\u2019ve finally come up against a potential licensee that has the resources and the will to put Qualcomm\u2019s business model and licensing practices on trial.\u201d  Qualcomm requires device makers to sign a license to its patents before it will supply chips, which it views as a commonsense measure to ensure it does not do business with companies violating its patents. But Apple and other device makers around the world have called the \u201cno license, no chips\u201d policy a form of \u201cdouble dipping\u201d - that is, charging for the same intellectual property once during licensing discussions, and then again in the price of the chips where the patents are embodied.  Apple and allies are asking for an end to that practice and a refund of about $9 billion - an amount that could be tripled if a jury finds in Apple\u2019s favor for antitrust allegations - for contract factories such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd\u2019s Foxconn, who paid the royalties and were reimbursed by Apple. Apple alleges the practices kept rivals like Intel Corp out of the market for years.  \u201cEven very big companies like Intel have felt at a disadvantage,\u201d said Michael Salzman, an antitrust attorney with Hughes Hubbard & Reed not involved in the case.  Qualcomm will argue that it had been working successfully with contract factories for years before Apple introduced its iPhone. But Apple used its heft in the industry to get those factories to break their longstanding contracts with Qualcomm, depriving it of at least $7 billion in royalties it was due, the chip supplier alleges.  The chip supplier will also argue that its licensing practices have been consistent for decades and only came under fire when Apple, known in the electronics industry for pushing suppliers to contain costs, took issue with it. A victory would secure Qualcomm\u2019s status as a major technology provider for 5G, the next generation of mobile data networks coming online this year.  \u201cI don\u2019t think (a Qualcomm victory) would be great for Apple, but if it\u2019s about money, they\u2019ve got plenty of money,\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, an equity analyst for Bernstein who follows Qualcomm. \u201cFor Qualcomm, it\u2019s an existential attack on the meat of their business model.\u201d","104":"SAN JOSE, California - (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission's antitrust case accusing Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O of abusing a monopoly on mobile chip technology kicked off in a California courtroom on Friday in a trial whose outcome could have a major impact on the smartphone industry.  FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  If the government prevails in the 10-day, non-jury trial before U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, in San Jose, California, Qualcomm could be forced to change its practices for licensing a trove of patents to manufacturers like iPhone maker Apple Inc AAPL.O.  Apple will be closely watching the FTC case, as it has its own pending lawsuit making similar claims against Qualcomm.  The outcome of the case will have a major impact on any settlement discussions between Apple and Qualcomm, Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley said in a research note.  Though well-known as a maker of smartphone chips, Qualcomm derives more of its profits licensing patents to other companies.  The FTC\u2019s 2017 lawsuit alleged San Diego-based Qualcomm maintains an anticompetitive \u201cno license, no chips\u201d policy under which it only supplied processors to phone manufacturers if they agree to inflated patent licensing terms.  \u201cQualcomm says you will pay our rates if you want our chips,\u201d Jennifer Milici, an attorney for the Federal Trade Commission, said during opening arguments. \u201cThe only way to arrive at a market rate [for Qualcomm\u2019s patents] is to negotiate without that threat.\u201d  The agency also said Qualcomm pushed Apple into an anticompetitive deal in which the iPhone maker received financial rebates in exchange for only buying Qualcomm's chips, undermining competition from Intel Corp INTC.O.  But Robert Van Nest, an attorney for Qualcomm, said during opening arguments that Qualcomm entered a deal with Apple because the iPhone maker was asking Qualcomm to invest billions to make Qualcomm chips work in the iPhone with no guarantee of how many chips Apple would ultimately buy. He argued the deal was made on market terms, as were others Qualcomm made with phone makers.  \u201cSamsung, Lenovo, Huawei - they\u2019re big companies that throw their own weight around,\u201d Van Nest said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between hard bargaining and threats and coercion.\u201d  Qualcomm has argued it achieved market dominance through technological leadership. The company began its licensing business in the 1980s and 1990s, decades before it began selling chips, and has charged broadly similar patent rates since then.  \u201cYears before there was any chip business, Qualcomm went out to the market to raise money to do this inventive work,\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s Van Nest told the court. \u201cIf these folks thought that these rates were unfair, these folks had years to deal with it. The rates didn\u2019t go up when Qualcomm started selling chips.\u201d  But Qualcomm\u2019s business practices have also been investigated by regulators in South Korea, China, Taiwan, and Europe. Qualcomm has accused Apple of driving those regulatory actions.  European antitrust officials hit Qualcomm with a 997 million euro ($1.14 billion) fine in January 2018, saying the firm unlawfully paid billions of dollars to Apple so it would not buy from rivals. Qualcomm has appealed the determination.  Apple and Qualcomm are also locked in a global legal dispute. After Apple brought its antitrust case, Qualcomm responded by accusing Apple of using patented technology without authorization.  In December, Qualcomm won rulings limiting iPhone sales in Germany and China.","105":"TAIPEI\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O will settle an anti-trust case with Taiwanese regulators for about $93 million, and has also pledged to invest $700 million in Taiwan over the next five years.  The settlement replaces a fine of roughly $778 million imposed by Taiwan\u2019s Fair Trade Commission in 2017, when it accused the U.S. firm of refusing to sell chips to mobile handset makers that wouldn\u2019t agree to its patent-licensing terms.  It was also accused of cutting iPhone maker Apple Inc AAPL.O a royalty discount in exchange for the exclusive use of Qualcomm's modem chips in the past.  Under the settlement, Qualcomm will have to provide reports every six months to Taiwanese officials for five years to show it is negotiating in good faith with handset makers in patent-licensing deals.  Moreover, Qualcomm will be required to offer patent licenses to rival chipmakers such as Intel Corp INTC.O and MediaTek Inc 2454.TW on fair terms before seeking to enforce its patent rights against them in court. Qualcomm also is in the midst of appealing a $927 million fine from the Korea Fair Trade Commission and a $1.2 billion fine from the European Commission. It also faces a lawsuit from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and is in a wide-ranging legal dispute with Apple.  As part of the Taiwanese settlement, Qualcomm will continue to be allowed to charge a royalty based on the selling price of a handset - a core part of its licensing model that Apple and others have objected to.  Because the settlement replaces the original decision and fine, other anti-trust regulators and legal foes will now be less likely to be able to use the commission\u2019s findings as a basis for their own legal actions.  Mediatek said the Commission\u2019s decision failed to protect a fair competitive environment as Qualcomm was not required to adjust its business model of charging a royalty fee.  \u201cIt will have negative impact on Taiwan\u2019s 5G industry and therefore hurt Taiwan\u2019s global competitiveness,\u201d the company said in a statement on Friday.  As part of the deal Qualcomm said it had agreed to build new manufacturing and operations facilities in Taiwan and work with Taiwan universities and start-ups on technology initiatives around so-called 5G technology, the next generation of wireless networks.  Taiwan\u2019s Fair Trade Commission said that amounted to an investment pledge of $700 million over five years.  \u201cWith the uncertainty removed, we can now focus on expanding our relationships that support the Taiwanese wireless industry and rapid adoption of 5G technology,\u201d Alex Rogers, Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing chief, said in a statement.","106":"April 19 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc:  * QUALCOMM IN NOTICE FILED WITH CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT - REDUCING 1,231 EMPLOYEES IN SAN DIEGO; EMPLOYMENT TERMINATIONS TO BEGIN ON\/ABOUT JUNE 19  * QUALCOMM IN NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT - REDUCING WORKFORCE AT SAN JOSE, SANTA CLARA OFFICES; TO IMPACT ABOUT 269 EMPLOYEES Further company coverage:","107":"March 9 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc:  * QUALCOMM EXTENDS CASH TENDER OFFER FOR ALL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF NXP  * QUALCOMM INC - TENDER OFFER IS NOW SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AT 5:00 P.M., NEW YORK CITY TIME, ON MARCH 16, 2018 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","108":"Nov 6 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc beat analysts\u2019 estimates for fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday, sending its shares up 5% in extended trading.

Shares of Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, rose nearly 2 percent in after-hours trading.  The forecast allays investor concerns about a weak smart phone market in China and elsewhere and comes as a relief to investors after multiple other chipmakers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, Samsung and Intel Corp, delivered lower-than-expected sales forecasts this month, citing economic weakness in China.  Qualcomm, which generates most of its profits by licensing its technology to mobile phone makers and others, said that under the deal reached with Huawei, the Chinese company is paying $150 million per quarter for three quarters as the two work toward a final resolution of a licensing dispute.  Qualcomm was previously receiving $100 million per quarter from Huawei. Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, said the $150 million is still less than Qualcomm believes it is owed but that the new deal is \u201con slightly better terms, which is very good.\u201d  Qualcomm executives said the company still does not have a timeline for final resolution of the Huawei dispute, but the progress is a positive sign for the company\u2019s licensing business. Qualcomm said it expects the business to generate between $1 billion and $1.1 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, roughly in line with analyst expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Legal worries around the company\u2019s licensing division have weighed heavily on Qualcomm over the past two years as it wages a costly and broad ranging dispute with iPhone maker Apple Inc and government regulators.  Qualcomm on Wednesday also said it had reduced operating expenses by $850 million, part of a plan announced last year to reduce them by $1 billion. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, George Davis, told Reuters that litigation costs were part of the reason why Qualcomm remains short of its goal.  Modem chip shipments fell 21.5 percent to 186 million, but were better than analysts estimate of 185.4 million, according to FactSet.  Qualcomm said it expects current-quarter revenue of between $4.4 billion and $5.2 billion, meeting analysts\u2019 estimate of $4.80 billion at the midpoint, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Net income attributable to Qualcomm was $1.07 billion, or 87 cents per share, for the first quarter ended Dec. 30, compared with a loss of $5.98 billion, or $4.05 per share, a year earlier when it took a $6 billion tax charge.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.20 per share, topping the analyst average estimate of $1.09.

The filing with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came after U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh last week declined to put on hold her own ruling in a case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission against the San Diego company, which is the largest supplier of modem chips that connect smartphones to wireless data networks.  Koh ruled that Qualcomm had engaged in anticompetitive patent-licensing practices to keep a monopoly on the mobile chip market. Koh ordered Qualcomm to license its technology to rival chipmakers, which include firms like Taiwan\u2019s MediaTek Inc. Qualcomm has been fighting to have the ruling put on hold while it pursues an appeal, which could take more than year.  The San Diego, California company has argued that letting the ruling stand could upend its talks with phone makers over chips for 5G, the next generation of wireless data networks.  \u201cQualcomm will be unable to revert back to its current license agreements, undo this web of new agreements, reverse any exhaustion of its patent rights, or recover all the revenue lost or transaction costs incurred\u201d if it ultimately wins its appeal but the judgment remains in force during the process, the company wrote.  Qualcomm also challenged Koh\u2019s ruling that Qualcomm\u2019s patent fees are a \u201csurcharge\u201d on other chip suppliers, effectively raising their prices and making them less able to compete with Qualcomm. Qualcomm charges phone makers the patent fees whether or not they buy Qualcomm chips because the patents cover fundamental aspects of cellular technology that go beyond its own modems.  Koh ruled that phone makers likely take into account the total cost of the bundle of license fees plus the chips, which makes Qualcomm\u2019s overall package less expensive than its rivals, violating competition laws. Qualcomm rejected that theory in its filing Monday.  \u201cThere is, moreover, no reason that (smartphone) OEMs would regard the royalties they pay Qualcomm as attributable to the prices the OEMs pay for rivals\u2019 chips - any more than they are attributable to the price the OEMs pay for other components such as batteries or screens,\u201d the company wrote in its filing.","128":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc has no plans to abandon its efforts to create processors for data centers, the company\u2019s president, who oversees the chip division, said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips in mobile phones, last year launched chips that use technology from Softbank Group Corp\u2019s ARM Holdings to power the workhorse computer servers behind cloud-based services such as social networks.  Qualcomm\u2019s push to enter the data center market puts it in direct competition with Intel Corp, which dominates data centers and now draws half of its revenue from servers and other \u201cdata centric\u201d chips.  But in May, Bloomberg reported that Qualcomm was exploring whether to sell or shut down the server chip unit.  Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon told Reuters on Monday that the chipmaker is making staff reductions in the unit but intends to keep operating it, albeit with a narrower focus on large internet companies in the United States and China.  \u201cWe are not looking at strategic options. We are not selling. We are still focused on it,\u201d Amon told Reuters.  San Diego-based Qualcomm declined to say whether it had considered selling the server chip unit at some point in the past. The company instead pointed to an April earnings call in which Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf said Qualcomm was considering cost-cutting options in areas that are not central to Qualcomm\u2019s business, which overwhelmingly comes from selling chips and licensing technology for mobile phones.  Amon told Reuters that the server chip business will be rolled into Qualcom\u2019s Qualcomm CDMA Technologies unit, which designs and sells mobile phone chips, to gain cost efficiencies.  Amon said the restructured server chip unit will focus on large cloud computing players. He would not name U.S. targets, but said the company is hoping to sell to Chinese internet giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Tencent Holdings Ltd and Baidu Inc through a joint venture in China.

In a filing that followed up on its letter to Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan on Thursday rebutting his latest offer, the San Diego-based company laid out more detail on its reservations about the deal.  It said two customers who provide more than $1 billion in chip revenue each had vowed to move away if the deal went through, citing a lack of confidence in Broadcom\u2019s ability to continue to lead in technology.  Broadcom, which makes connectivity chips used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers, first approached Qualcomm in November.  After its first offer was rejected, Broadcom nominated a slate of directors to replace Qualcomm\u2019s board. Qualcomm shareholders are scheduled to vote on the nominations on March 6.  With that in mind, the company is seeking to strike a balance between continued resistance to Broadcom\u2019s takeover and heeding the calls of shareholders who have urged the company to engage with its rival in case it can clinch an attractive deal.  Qualcomm counts Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd among its key customers. Other clients include Huawei Technologies, LG Electronics, Oppo, Sony Corp, Vivo and Xiaomi, all of which make smartphones.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  In rejecting Broadcom\u2019s latest offer on Thursday, Qualcomm offered to meet its rival to see if they can hammer out their differences. Broadcom welcomed the move, but said it wanted to meet before Qualcomm\u2019s proposed date on Tuesday, ahead of scheduled meetings with proxy advisory firms.  A date for a meeting between Qualcomm and Broadcom had not been finalized as of Friday morning.  In the filing on Friday, Qualcomm also raised concerns about potential antitrust issues and said Broadcom would damage, if not destroy, its licensing business that is valued at over $4 billion.  \u201cBroadcom completely ignores the reality that in the last five years, several large, complex international mergers involving multiple regulators have taken over 18 months. And at the moment, there is no \u2018next\u2019 step,\u201d Qualcomm said.  Broadcom said it will pay Qualcomm $8 billion if the deal fails to win regulatory approval.  Separately on Friday, Qualcomm said it extended the cash tender offer to buy NXP Semiconductors NV by two weeks to Feb. 23.  Broadcom had said earlier that its revised offer was contingent on either Qualcomm buying NXP at currently disclosed terms of $110 per share in cash or the $38 billion deal being terminated.","132":"FILE PHOTO: A manufacturer works at an assembly line of Vingroup's Vsmart phone in Hai Phong, Vietnam December 4, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The new deal puts pressure on Broadcom to decide if it will stick with a stipulation in its bid that Qualcomm does not raise its offer for NXP. It could strengthen Qualcomm\u2019s defenses because it allows its shareholders to better assess the standalone value of Qualcomm as an alternative to a deal with Broadcom.  Qualcomm shares fell 1.3 percent to $63.99, significantly below Broadcom\u2019s latest $82 per share cash-and-stock offer unveiled on Feb. 5, as investors saw the new NXP deal as increasing the chances of Qualcomm repelling Broadcom.  Broadcom said on Tuesday it was evaluating its options in response to Qualcomm\u2019s move and noted that the revised price for NXP was well beyond what Qualcomm has repeatedly characterized as \u201cfull and fair.\u201d It called the new deal a transfer of value from Qualcomm shareholders to NXP shareholders.  In an interview with Reuters, Qualcomm\u2019s presiding board director Tom Horton argued that the revised deal with NXP represented value for Qualcomm shareholders irrespective of the outcome of the takeover battle with Broadcom.  \u201cIt makes Qualcomm stronger and more profitable and diversified if there is no deal with Broadcom, and if we do decide to pursue a sale the same is true, more value would accrue to the Qualcomm shareholders,\u201d Horton said.  Qualcomm raised its offer for NXP from $110 to $127.50 per share in cash. In exchange, it received binding agreements from nine NXP stockholders that collectively own more than 28 percent of NXP\u2019s outstanding shares to support the deal. These include hedge funds Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd and Soroban Capital Partners LP, which had spearheaded opposition to the NXP deal.  NXP\u2019s shares rose 6 percent to $125.56. The stock had traded above the original offer price for nearly seven months, reflecting expectations among investors that Qualcomm\u2019s offer would be raised.  NXP shareholders have to tender their shares in an offer that is currently set to expire on March 5, though Qualcomm has repeatedly pushed back this deadline as it awaits clearance from China\u2019s MOFCOM, the only regulator globally needed to approved the deal that has yet to do so. The Chinese New Year holiday this month has delayed this review.  Under the new terms agreed with NXP\u2019s board, the deal with Qualcomm is contingent on 70 percent of NXP\u2019s shares being tendered, instead of the 80 percent threshold required in the earlier agreement signed in October 2016. Once this threshold is reached, Qualcomm can take over the entire company through a \u201csecond-step\u201d transaction mechanism.  The new NXP deal came less than a week after Broadcom and Qualcomm executives met face-to-face for the first time to discuss the differences between the two sides. Qualcomm called the meeting constructive but reiterated it had several concerns over price and regulatory risk.  BOARD CHALLENGE  The acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm to expand in the fast-growing market for chips used in automobiles and reduce its dependence on the competitive smartphone market.  The takeover battle between Qualcomm and Broadcom is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS use their market dominance to negotiate lower chip prices.  Singapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily outsources the manufacturing of its chips which are used for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  To put pressure on Qualcomm, Broadcom has put forward six nominees up for election at Qualcomm\u2019s March 6 shareholder meeting to replace the majority of the company\u2019s eleven-member board of directors.  Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis on Tuesday recommended Qualcomm shareholders vote for all six director nominees Broadcom has put forward.  Last week, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) had recommended for the election of four Broadcom nominees. While this recommendation would fall short of Broadcom\u2019s nominees winning a majority on Qualcomm\u2019s board, ISS said such a vote by Qualcomm shareholders would offer a reasonable path to a negotiated deal that would deliver value.  \u201cISS and Glass Lewis only influence a minority of our shareholders. They belie the fact that the Qualcomm board is doing everything it can in the furtherance of the interests of its shareholders. The ISS and Glass Lewis reports are also dated because they came out before certainty was secured on the NXP deal,\u201d Horton said.","135":"A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen, as chip maker Broadcom Ltd announced an unsolicited bid to buy peer Qualcomm Inc for $103 billion, in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Qualcomm, T-Mobile US and Sprint have been thrown for a loop this week. And they and their investors have the random nature of oversight in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to thank for it.  The chipmaker lost some 11% off its $94 billion market value in Wednesday morning trading after a judge ruled it had engaged in anti-competitive practices. Sprint, meanwhile, dipped almost 6% after the Department of Justice staffers indicated they wouldn\u2019t recommend its $26 billion merger with T-Mobile.  These are usual risks companies face. Trouble is, guidance from Washington is all over the place. Qualcomm\u2019s case was brought by the Federal Trade Commission in the dying days of Barack Obama\u2019s time in the White House. Trump\u2019s FTC has a majority of Republican appointees, but didn\u2019t stop the process, even though the president\u2019s decision to sink Broadcom\u2019s hostile $117 billion bid last year effectively crowned Qualcomm as a national champion. Meanwhile, the DOJ tried and failed to persuade U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh to hold a hearing, arguing harsh remedies could harm competition.  The T-Mobile-Sprint deal is going through its own loopy process. The DOJ and the Federal Communications Commission both have to approve the deal. Usually agencies coordinate on such matters \u2013 as the two did when nixing the two telecom rivals\u2019 earlier attempt to tie the knot in 2014. In this case, the two are at loggerheads: FCC Chair Ajit Pai endorses the merger.  Antitrust boss Makan Delrahim has the final decision at Justice and has another issue to factor in: the duo\u2019s claim they will build better 5G infrastructure together is one of Trump\u2019s favorite initiatives. Even if he does give the nod, his team\u2019s disapproval gives state attorneys general an opening to file a lawsuit against the merger.  There are other examples. In 2017 the DOJ sued AT&T to try to block its acquisition of Time Warner. Yet it waved through Walt Disney\u2019s $71 billion deal for parts of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox empire with only a few conditions.  Overseers\u2019 ties to industry complicate matters, too. FTC Chair Joseph Simons took himself out of the Qualcomm case because of past work with the firm. U.S. Attorney General William Barr recused himself from ruling on T-Mobile-Sprint because he owned their bonds.  The message this all sends to company executives is that policy is blowing in the wind. That\u2019s bad for business.","136":"BEIJING, June 1 (Reuters) - China\u2019s markets regulator said on Friday it is still reviewing Qualcomm Inc\u2019s proposed $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV and is in talks with Qualcomm about ways to eliminate negative market impacts from the deal.

A spokesman for Gravis, Germany's biggest reseller of Apple products which is owned by telecoms company Freenet FNTGn.DE, said on Friday that it still had all Apple products on sale, including the iPhone 7 and 8 models.  The German case is Qualcomm\u2019s third major effort to secure a ban on Apple\u2019s lucrative iPhones over patent infringement allegations after similar moves in the United States and China, and is part of a global patent spat between the two companies.  Qualcomm posted bonds of 1.34 billion euros ($1.5 billion) on Thursday, as required for the German court order to come into effect. The court found on Dec. 20 that Apple had infringed Qualcomm patents on power-saving technology used in smartphones.  Apple said in a statement after the verdict last month that it would pull iPhone 7 and 8 models from its own 15 retail stores in Germany during an appeal process once the order came into force. However, it also said it would continue to offer all of its phones at thousands of retail and carrier locations across Germany, a direct contradiction to Qualcomm\u2019s interpretation of the order.  A spokeswoman for the Munich regional court told Reuters on Friday that Apple had appealed the court\u2019s Dec. 20 ruling.  Apple, which had also said it planned to appeal the court decision, declined to comment on Qualcomm\u2019s most recent move on Friday, only referring to its statement after the verdict.  According to the court order, Apple has to stop the sale, offer for sale and importation for sale of all infringing iPhones in Germany.  The court also ordered Apple to recall the affected iPhones from third-party resellers in Germany, according to a statement by Qualcomm.  Kai Ruting, a German lawyer not involved in the case, said the court order was directed at Apple entities rather than third parties.  \u201cThese third parties are still free to sell the (affected) iPhones, and they sell the majority of iPhones,\u201d Ruting said, adding, \u201cthe question of a settlement will be driven by the U.S. litigation and not the German case.\u201d  Ruting said that Apple had strong arguments for the German court\u2019s ruling to be reversed on appeal. If that happens, Qualcomm\u2019s bond will be used to compensate Apple, he said.  Apple\u2019s announced intention to pull iPhones from stores in Germany contrasts with how it has handled a court decision in China, where there was a much broader ban on iPhone sales after a court ruled the devices violated Qualcomm\u2019s patents. Apple has continued to sell phones in China, saying it believed its phones were legal in the country.  Still, Apple also pushed a software update to address concerns over whether it was in compliance with Chinese courts.  Qualcomm has said those software updates were insufficient and that Apple must still withdraw its phones. Apple had filed a request for the Chinese court to reconsider its decision, but no outcome has been announced.

The case, brought by Qualcomm, is part of a global patent dispute between the two U.S. companies that includes dozens of lawsuits. It creates uncertainty over Apple\u2019s business in one of its biggest markets at a time when concerns over waning demand for new iPhones are battering its shares.  Apple said on Monday that all of its phone models remained on sale in mainland China and that it had filed a request for reconsideration with the court, the first step in a long appeal process that could end up at China\u2019s Supreme Court.  \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly unlikely, I\u2019d say almost impossible (that Apple would have to stop sales),\u201d said a Beijing-based IP lawyer who is not directly connected with the Qualcomm case but has worked with large U.S. tech firms.  \u201cIn all likelihood it will drag on for some time. It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that this is just one battle in a larger rift\u201d, he said, referring to the legal fight between Qualcomm and Apple that stretches from European courts to South Korea.  Qualcomm said in a statement the Fuzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court in China found Apple infringed two patents held by the chipmaker and ordered an immediate ban on sales of older iPhone models, from the 6S through the X.  Apple said the trio of new models released in September were not part of the case.  \u201cQualcomm\u2019s effort to ban our products is another desperate move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators around the world,\u201d Apple said.  Reuters couldn\u2019t immediately reach the court for comment.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Qualcomm is seen during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 27, 2018. REUTERS\/Yves Herman\/File Photo  China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are Apple\u2019s third-largest market, accounting for about one-fifth of Apple\u2019s $265.6 billion in sales in its most recent fiscal year.  Qualcomm, the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, filed its case in China in late 2017, arguing that Apple infringed patents on features related to resizing photographs and managing apps on a touch screen.  COURT BATTLE OVER DETAILS  In July, the same court banned the import of some microchips by Micron Technology Inc into China, citing violation of patents held by Taiwan\u2019s United Microelectronics Corp (UMC).  In the provincial Chinese court, which is separate from China\u2019s specialized intellectual property courts in Beijing, one party can request a ban on an opponent\u2019s product without the opponent getting a chance to present a defense.  IP lawyers said that an appeal process could take the case up to the Fujian provincial high court and then go as far as the Supreme Court in Beijing, a process that would likely take many months given the high-profile nature of the case.  To enforce the ban, Qualcomm separately will have to file complaints in what is known as an enforcement tribunal, where Apple will also have a chance to appeal.  Yiqiang Li, a patent lawyer at Faegre Baker Daniels, said the Chinese injunction could put pressure on Apple to reach a global settlement with Qualcomm.  Apple shares rose less than 1 percent to $169.60, recovering from an early drop when it became clear phones were still on sale, and Qualcomm stock rose 2.2 percent to $57.24.  TRADE WAR IMPACT?  The ruling comes as Beijing and Washington are locked in a tense trade dispute. The two sides have agreed to trade negotiations that must be concluded by March 1.  While IP lawyers said the case wasn\u2019t directly political, most agreed it could be drawn into broader Sino-U.S. trade tensions, where technology and IP have been a core focus.  The specific iPhone models affected by the preliminary ruling in China are the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X.  Erick Robinson, a patent lawyer in Beijing and former Qualcomm lawyer, said that while Chinese courts had become fairer in recent years, nationalism could sometimes be a factor in rulings.  Qualcomm is a key technology vendor to China\u2019s rising smart phone brands such as Xiaomi Corp, Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus, while Apple competes directly against Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], China\u2019s top homegrown maker of premium-priced smartphones, whose CFO was arrested this month for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions.  \u201cThere is probably a political play here. Apple is a direct competitor to the biggest companies in China, whereas Qualcomm is a supplier,\u201d Robinson said.  Qualcomm officials said tensions between the two nations had no bearing on the ruling. The company has had its share of troubles in China, from an unfavorable 2014 antitrust ruling to regulatory limbo that doomed its $44 billion bid for Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors.","144":"A booth of U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm is pictured at an expo in Beijing, China, September 27, 2017.

Those measures, along with a new 25-cent quarterly dividend and a $5 billion share repurchase program, are NXP\u2019s first major signals about its plans since its proposed $44 billion merger with Qualcomm ended in July. Qualcomm, unable to secure approval from Chinese regulators amid trade tensions between the United States and China, dropped its bid for NXP.  During the nearly two years the deal was pending, NXP did not hold quarterly conference calls with analysts and investors.  Tore Svanberg, a managing director with Stifel equity research, said it would take a long time for the company to regain momentum lost during the merger. \u201cWe also do not believe a bigger buyback and the initiation of a dividend payment is enough to restore investor confidence,\u201d Svanberg said.  Analysts have pressed the company on whether it can raise gross margins above 60 percent, like Texas Instruments Inc TXN.O or Intel. But Clemmer told Reuters in a telephone interview that those margins are not necessary to meet NXP's growth and cash return goals.  Clemmer said NXP's growth opportunities in cars are immediate and tangible - such as for radar systems that help cars stay in their lane and are fast becoming standard - compared with the fully autonomous vehicles that rivals like Nvidia Corp NVDA.O are pursing.  \u201cThe car companies are now beginning to work with semiconductors companies (like NXP) directly. We see a lot more work with the car companies,\u201d he said.  NXP\u2019s shares closed down 4.4 percent at $89.57 on Nasdaq.","146":"June 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday said in a court filing that mobile chip supplier Qualcomm Inc should not be allowed to put a sweeping antitrust ruling against it on hold as it pursues an appeal.  The filing in federal court in San Jose, California, follows a May 21 decision by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh that would drastically alter the business model of Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips to connect phones to mobile data networks but makes most of its profits through licensing patents.  Among other things, Koh\u2019s decision would require Qualcomm to license its patents to rival chip makers instead of phone makers, which could potentially slice its patent royalties from several dollars per phone to pennies.  Qualcomm on May 28 asked Koh to set aside her decision while it pursues an appeal. The company said that Koh\u2019s decision would entail \u201cradically restructuring its business relationships\u201d in ways that would be impossible to reverse if it wins an appeal.  It also argued that Koh\u2019s ruling raised \u201cserious legal questions\u201d because, among other things, Koh blocked market evidence showing that Apple Inc dropped Qualcomm in favor of rival chip supplier Intel Corp.  In its filing on Tuesday, the FTC argued that Koh\u2019s ruling should stay in place while Qualcomm appeals, saying that a prompt enforcement of the Court\u2019s order is in the public interest.  Qualcomm has signaled its intention to file an appeal but has not yet filed one or fully revealed its legal arguments. Tuesday\u2019s filing by the FTC only concerns whether the ruling\u2019s provisions will be put on hold temporarily as any appeal plays out.

FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen, as chip maker Broadcom Ltd announced an unsolicited bid to buy peer Qualcomm Inc for $103 billion, in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The secretive panel, called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), has scuppered several attempts by Chinese technology companies to acquire U.S. chipmakers in the last 12 months over concerns about the transfer of potentially sensitive technology.  Broadcom is not a Chinese company, and has pledged to move its domicile from Singapore to the United States, arguing this will makes its acquisition of Qualcomm not covered by CFIUS. However, many of Qualcomm\u2019s rivals, including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], are Chinese.  Huawei is forging closer commercial ties with big telecommunication operators across Asia, the Americas and Europe, putting the company in prime position to lead the global race for wireless 5G networks, despite U.S. allegations it poses a security threat.  CFIUS views Qualcomm as a prized U.S. asset in the development of 5G wireless technology, which allows for the transmission of data at very fast speeds. It wants to make sure Qualcomm does not lose its status as a dominant player in wireless chip technology, according to a source familiar with the panel\u2019s thinking.  As a result, Broadcom\u2019s business plan for Qualcomm, including any divestitures it plans in order to appease antitrust regulators, will be scrutinized by CFIUS, lawyers who advised companies on their CFIUS applications said.  \u201cThis shows how indirect exposure to China is a frequent, but under-noticed, source of perceived national security risk,\u201d said Mario Mancuso, a former CFIUS member who is now a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP.  CFIUS\u2019 stance has toughened as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to pressure China to help tackle North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions and be more accommodative on trade and foreign exchange issues.  Unfilled political vacancies in several government departments and agencies have also made it harder for CFIUS to approve deals.  Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC, a U.S.-based private equity firm funded by the Chinese government, saw its $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor Corp LSCC.O collapse last year after it was blocked by CFIUS, a rejection subsequently upheld by Trump.  Last month, U.S. semiconductor testing company Xcerra Corp XCRA.O said CFIUS had blocked its $580 million sale to a Chinese state-backed semiconductor investment fund.  Reuters reported last week that CFIUS had begun looking at Broadcom\u2019s bid as pressure grew from politicians, including senior Republican U.S. Senator John Cornyn.  \u201cQualcomm is a leader in 5G technology, which is going to be the new standard in the future. And, as we\u2019ve seen, some of our international rivals, like China, have been incredibly aggressive and strategic,\u201d Cornyn said on Monday. He has proposed legislation to tighten CFIUS\u2019 scrutiny of deals.  PROXY CONTEST  CFIUS\u2019 intervention was unusual in that the panel typically reviews signed deals. However, Qualcomm has been resisting Broadcom\u2019s overtures, prompting the latter to nominate six directors to Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board at its shareholder meeting. CFIUS on Sunday ordered Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, which was scheduled for Tuesday, for a month.  Qualcomm filed a voluntary request for CFIUS to review Broadcom\u2019s bid on Jan. 29. CFIUS rules allow a company facing an unsolicited takeover bid to request a CFIUS review, so that its board of directors can better assess the regulatory risk of a deal.  \u201cThe rules say that one party alone could approach CFIUS and for a review,\u201d said McDermott Will & Emery LLP regulatory lawyer David Levine.  Such circumstances are few and far between. Miner Rio Tinto Plc RIO.L asked CFIUS for a review in 2008 after facing a hostile $150 billion bid by BHP Billiton Ltd BHP.AX, according to a source familiar with the matter. CFIUS allowed the bid, but BHP subsequently walked away from the deal in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  Broadcom struggled to win CFIUS approval to buy Brocade Communications Systems late last year. In the end, that approval came just weeks after Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan announced in an Oval Office ceremony with Trump that Broadcom would bring its headquarters to the United States.","148":"SAN FRANCISCO, April 25 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday showed just how far the company is willing to go to preserve one of its core business practices of taking a cut of the selling price of phones.  The San Diego-based chipmaker posted quarterly profit and revenue that topped Wall Street forecasts, suggesting that a slowdown in the global smartphone business might be less severe than feared after a string of weak forecasts from other industry suppliers.  But Qualcomm\u2019s other line of business - licensing a trove of patents that help make smart phones work - has traditionally driven most of its profits. And that business has dropped sharply over the past year, as revenue attributable to Apple Inc iPhones is withheld amid a legal dispute.  Qualcomm gave two indications on Wednesday it was prepared to accept lower revenue in exchange for maintaining the business structure and avoiding future customer disputes.  Most Qualcomm licensing revenue is calculated as a percentage of the selling price of a smartphone. That so-called device-level licensing model has been at the center of regulatory disputes in China, Korea and the United States and also in its disputes with Apple.  On Wednesday, Qualcomm said it would cap the phone price that is the basis of the revenue calculation at $400. More expensive phones, which can sell for $1,000, would still be treated as $400 for the purpose of the Qualcomm license fee.  That move follows a Qualcomm decision in November to license some patents that are required for connecting to so-called 5G networks, the next generation of mobile data networks, at a rate of 3.25 percent.  The net effect is that Qualcomm keeps its device-level licensing model and likely accepts less revenue, said Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan.  \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper for most people,\u201d Chan said. \u201cWhat Qualcomm is trying to do is ... get everyone to sign a licensing agreement with them so they don\u2019t have to worry too much.\u201d  When Qualcomm executives were asked directly by an analyst on the post-earnings conference call whether the company would receive less revenue from 5G patents, they disputed the notion.  \u201cWe\u2019re not getting paid less for it,\u201d said Alex Rogers, Qualcomm\u2019s licensing chief. \u201cI think the best way to think about this is building a foundation for long-term stability\u201d for Qualcomm\u2019s licensing business.  Chan said that a recent deal with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd also appeared to show that the rate was lower. In February, Qualcomm said it had amended a 2009 Samsung agreement with a new licensing rate as part of a deal to settle a regulatory dispute in Korea.  Qualcomm cut its licensing forecast by $300 million for the third quarter and Chief Financial Officer George Davis said just under half of the change was due to changes in arrangements with Samsung and other moves. That, said Chan, indicated a cheaper deal for Samsung.

The reduction comes after the Supreme Court overturned in January one of several lower court rulings against the U.S. firm for abusing its dominant market position.

The decision issued late Tuesday night by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, caused Qualcomm shares to plunge 11 percent on Wednesday.  \u201cQualcomm\u2019s licensing practices have strangled competition\u201d in parts of the chip market for years, harming rivals, smartphone makers, and consumers, Koh wrote in a 233-page decision.  She ordered the San Diego-based company to renegotiate licensing agreements at reasonable prices, without threatening to cut off supplies, and ordered that it be monitored for seven years to ensure its compliance.  Qualcomm said it will immediately ask Koh to put her decision on hold, and also seek a quick appeal to the federal appeals court in California.  \u201cWe strongly disagree with the judge\u2019s conclusions, her interpretation of the facts and her application of the law,\u201d general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement.  Koh\u2019s decision followed a 10-day non-jury trial in January, and is a victory for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which has accused Qualcomm in 2017 of violating antitrust law.  The decision followed Qualcomm\u2019s April 16 settlement of a long-running legal battle with Apple Inc, where Apple agreed once again to use Qualcomm chips in its iPhones, displacing Intel Corp.  It is unclear whether the sanctions will be challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice, which has taken a different view of the case than the FTC and emerged as an ally to Qualcomm.  On May 2, the Justice Department argued Koh should hold a hearing before placing sanctions on Qualcomm. Placing stringent conditions on the company would \u201creduce competition and innovation in markets for 5G technology,\u201d the agency said.  The courts are not required to defer to the Justice Department\u2019s recommendations. But \u201cthe possibility certainly exists for Qualcomm to prevail upon appeal,\u201d given the government\u2019s \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d approach to the case, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote.  The Justice Department was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.  Qualcomm shares have risen about 51% since the company\u2019s settlement with Apple last month. The fall on Wednesday left them still comfortably above their level before the Apple deal.  UNDERMINING RIVALS  Koh said Qualcomm engaged in \u201cextensive\u201d anticompetitive conduct targeting more than one dozen original equipment manufacturers including Apple, BlackBerry, Huawei, Lenovo, LG, Motorola, Samsung, and Sony, often by cutting off or threatening to cut off chip supplies or withholding technical support.  She also said Qualcomm\u2019s monopoly power in modem chips enabled the company to sustain \u201cunreasonably high\u201d royalty rates not justified by its contributions to the marketplace.  \u201cWith practices that result in exclusivity and eliminate opportunities to compete for OEM business, Qualcomm undermines rivals in every facet,\u201d she wrote.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  She also found Qualcomm knew its licensing practices harmed competition \u201cyet continued anyway\u201d despite government investigations in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the European Union and the United States.  \u201cThis evidence of Qualcomm\u2019s intent confirms the court\u2019s conclusion that Qualcomm\u2019s practices cause anticompetitive harm because no monopolist monopolizes unconscious of what he is doing,\u201d she wrote.  Koh also said testimony from some Qualcomm witnesses \u201clacked credibility,\u201d faulting Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf and others for giving \u201clong, fast, and practiced narratives\u201d and saying company emails and notes contradicted his testimony.  Koh said Qualcomm cannot bundle patent licensing deals with its hardware, a practice regulators called \u201cno license, no chips.\u201d That ruling could give chip customers more leverage in negotiations over patent terms and result in lower royalty rates for Qualcomm.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  Koh also said Qualcomm must license its patents to rival chipmakers like MediaTek Inc.  Qualcomm argued during the trial that it achieved market dominance through technological leadership. The company began its licensing business in the 1980s and 1990s, decades before it began selling chips, and has charged broadly similar patent rates since then.  Qualcomm also argued that the FTC failed to show harm to competition, arguing that the chip industry is thriving and prices are declining.  Qualcomm\u2019s next move will likely be to request Koh\u2019s ruling is put on hold while the company seeks expedited review by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.  Gaston Kroub, a patent lawyer in New York not involved in the case, said Koh\u2019s decision was unlikely to be reversed on appeal because she made detailed factual findings and witness credibility determinations. Appeals courts are reluctant to second-guess such findings by trial judges, he said.  Qualcomm makes cellphone processors and modem chips, but generates most profits by licensing its technology to mobile phone makers.  \u201cQualcomm\u2019s customers and competitors will finally be able to negotiate licenses without the threat of having Qualcomm cut off their chip supply,\u201d FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra said in statement.  Rasgon, the Bernstein analyst, said Koh had indicated at trial she was leaning against Qualcomm, but some investors had hoped her views would be \u201csoftened\u201d by the Apple settlement.  \u201cApparently not,\u201d Rasgon wrote.","155":"(Reuters) -  Qualcomm Inc has beat back an attempt by consumers in a proposed antitrust class action to bar it from enforcing a ban on certain iPhone imports, should it win such a ban in its long-running intellectual property battle with Apple Inc.

For the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 27, Qualcomm said sales and adjusted profit were $8.24 billion and $2.17 per share, compared with analyst estimates of $8.27 billion and $2.10 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Chip and licensing revenue were $6.53 billion and $1.66 billion, respectively, beating estimates, according to FactSet data.  Qualcomm forecast sales with a midpoint of $7.6 billion and adjusted profit at a midpoint of $1.65 per share, slightly above expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Qualcomm is the world\u2019s biggest supplier of chips that help mobile phones connect to cellular data networks, providing chips to Apple Inc and other handset makers. Qualcomm disclosed Wednesday that chip sales to Apple are slightly less profitable than chip sales to other phone makers because Apple does not also buy additional software from Qualcomm in the way that Android device makers do.  But the company is also building out businesses supplying chips to automakers such as General Motors, which last week disclosed a deal to source chips from Qualcomm, and challenging Intel Corp with new processors for laptop and desktop computers.  Two of the company\u2019s newer business lines - radio frequency chips to help devices handle newer 5G signals and internet-of-things chips for devices such as wireless headphones - have now become billion-dollar-per-quarter businesses.  Cristiano Amon, the company\u2019s president who will take over as chief executive in June, said the company was \u201cwell hedged\u201d among chip suppliers because it sources parts from multiple contract manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd . But he added that demand was outstripping supply as rivals of Huawei, which largely did not use Qualcomm\u2019s chips, moved in to take the Chinese brand\u2019s market share.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing growth of share in a preeminent high tier,\u201d Amon said.  Qualcomm forecast a midpoint of $6.25 billion in revenue for its chip business in the fiscal second quarter, beating estimates of $5.62 billion, according to data from FactSet. Qualcomm forecast a midpoint of sales for its licensing business, which has higher margins than its chip business and generates much of its profit, of $1.35 billion, lower than estimates of $1.43 billion, according to FactSet.  The higher sales of chips - and chips with better margins - accounted for the company\u2019s above-expectations profit forecast despite falling short of estimates for its licensing business, Palkhiwala told Reuters.  Qualcomm said first-quarter sales for handset chips were $4.22 billion, jumping 79% from a year before on the strength of 5G phone upgrades. Sales of radio frequency chips, a growth area for Qualcomm, increased 157% to $1.06 billion. Automotive chips sales were $212 million, up 44% from the previous year.","167":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Thursday objected to a move by mobile chip supplier Qualcomm Inc to introduce internal Apple Inc documents in its fight to stop the enforcement of a May antitrust ruling.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  On Tuesday, Qualcomm submitted them to U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in opposition to a sweeping ruling that would alter its business model as it pursues an appeal. In the slides from internal Apple presentations, the iPhone maker outlined goals to \u201cCreate Leverage by Building Pressure\u201d and \u201cHurt Qualcomm Financially.\u201d  The slides were part of the opening statement presentation in Qualcomm\u2019s separate civil trial against Apple in April but were never submitted during Qualcomm\u2019s earlier trial with the FTC. If Koh accepts them, they would become part of the record that higher courts review when Qualcomm eventually files an appeal.  FTC officials on Thursday said the submission of the slides was \u201cimproper, unfair, and prejudicial.\u201d  The slides were part of Qualcomm\u2019s opening arguments from the Apple trial, in which the company outlined what its attorneys described as a targeted campaign by Apple to attack Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing model. In them, Apple discussed how to \u201cdevalue\u201d the kind of patents held by Qualcomm and \u201cReduce Apple\u2019s Net Royalty to Qualcomm.\u201d  The FTC said it had no formal chance to object to the slides.  \u201cHad the document survived a high-priority objection, an Apple witness may have testified to, among other things, the document\u2019s context and purpose and the meaning of the cited language,\u201d the FTC wrote Thursday.  Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips to connect phones to wireless data networks, is fighting for a freeze of Koh\u2019s ruling, which could potentially slice its patent royalties from several dollars per phone to pennies.  Smartphone maker LG Electronics Inc has opposed Qualcomm\u2019s efforts to freeze the ruling. The phone maker said it is negotiating chip supply and patent license agreements with Qualcomm and could be forced into signing another unfair deal unless Koh\u2019s protections remain in place. The FTC had also opposed Qualcomm\u2019s move.  On Tuesday, Qualcomm responded to LGE\u2019s allegations by saying that it had continued to supply chips to the Korean phone maker despite the fact that license negotiations ground to a halt and LGE had no license at all with Qualcomm earlier this year, the precise scenario that phone makers have argued could prompt Qualcomm to cut off chip supplies if Koh\u2019s ruling is not enforced.","168":"April 17 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc\u2019s surprise settlement of a prolonged legal fight with Apple Inc paves the way for the chipmaker to resolve a similar dispute with China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, ahead of the launch of 5G phones, several analysts said.  Shares of Qualcomm, which closed up 23 percent on Tuesday, rose another 10 percent in premarket trade on Wednesday after it signed a six-year patent license deal with Apple.  If Wednesday\u2019s gains hold, Qualcomm would tack on more than $20 billion in market value since announcing the settlement.  The two companies had been at odds over patents and royalties over modems. While Qualcomm did not close the terms of the deal, analysts estimated that Apple withheld $5 billion, or about $2 per share, under its previous royalty payment agreement.  Qualcomm and Huawei are also fighting over the same issues.  Huawei stopped royalty payments in April 2017 and Qualcomm said in January it has signed an interim agreement with the Chinese company and is in talks for a final resolution.  \u201cWe now expect an imminent settlement with Huawei which has also been withholding royalty payments, which we estimate will add another $0.50-$0.75 of EPS,\u201d Cowen and Company analysts said.  Three brokerages raised their ratings on Qualcomm\u2019s stock and at least eight brokerages boosted their price targets. Fourteen out of 25 brokerages rated the stock \u201cbuy\u201d or higher and the rest \u201chold\u201d, according to Refinitiv data.  A settlement with Apple and Huawei will not only bring in more royalty payments and reduce legal costs, it will help Qualcomm to focus more in rolling out its 5G modems, several analysts said.  The Qualcomm settlement means Apple will rely on the chipmaker for most if not all of its 5G modems in iPhones starting in 2020, with Qualcomm likely the leading to only supplier for the next several years, Canaccord Genuity analysts said.  Intel Corp, which was supplying modem chips to Apple for its latest iPhones, said late on Tuesday that it was exiting the phone modem business.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Broadcom\u2019s statement came after Qualcomm said earlier on Monday that all of Broadcom\u2019s previous offers - which would represent the largest technology deal on record - materially undervalued it, but that it wanted to negotiate further.  Broadcom accused Qualcomm of feigning engagement in the companies\u2019 two meetings earlier this month. It also said Qualcomm has refused to confirm that it will hold its previously scheduled stockholder vote on March 6. Broadcom has put forward six nominees for election to Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board as a way to force deal negotiations with Qualcomm.  \u201cBroadcom does not believe that the process outlined by Qualcomm today is designed to lead to a prompt agreement,\u201d Broadcom said in a statement.  Qualcomm responded by denying it was considering moving the date of its annual shareholder meeting. The company added in a statement that it had no intention of delaying the meeting, and said it had made that clear in talks with Broadcom on Friday.  \u201cThe ball is in Broadcom\u2019s court to let us know whether it is willing to engage with us,\u201d Qualcomm said.  In a letter to Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs on Monday proposed a new meeting focused on price as soon as convenient for both parties.

The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS use their market dominance to negotiate lower chip prices.  Broadcom cut its bid last week by 4 percent to $117 billion after Qualcomm's decision to raise its own bid for NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O to $44 billion.  Qualcomm\u2019s shares rose 5.8 percent to close Monday\u2019s trading at $66.98, still well below Broadcom\u2019s latest cash-and-stock offer of $79 per share.  Qualcomm also softened its approach to Broadcom\u2019s commitments on regulatory approval for the deal, saying the path forward did not require a \u201chell or high water\u201d commitment to sell any assets that the regulators require.  Qualcomm, however, urged the Singapore-based chipmaker to provide more clarity regarding its plans for Qualcomm\u2019s licensing business, which Broadcom has been unwilling to reveal. It also offered to sign a confidentiality agreement so both companies can carry out due diligence on one another.  \u201cWe are willing to jointly select a law firm with antitrust expertise that you would fully brief on your licensing plans,\u201d Qualcomm said.  In a meeting with Broadcom on Friday, Qualcomm proposed a reverse termination fee of 9 percent of enterprise value if Broadcom fails to win regulatory approvals.  Broadcom had previously proposed a $8 billion breakup fee.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday released a new chip for connecting devices to 5G networks that it hopes will be adopted for home internet use and inside businesses as a competitor to WiFi.  The San Diego chip designer is the biggest supplier of modem chips that connect smart phones and other consumer electronics to cellular data networks. Qualcomm is aiming to take advantage of the faster speeds possible with 5G network technology to expand its footprint in other markets.  The newest chip, called the X65 modem, is Qualcomm\u2019s fourth generation of 5G modem but the first capable of hitting peak download speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second, about 10 times faster than peaks on previous LTE networks and comparable to fiber broadband services.  A major focus for the new chip will be commercial and industrial applications, such as connecting computers and equipment scattered across corporate campuses directly to cloud computing services when a traditional WiFi network would not be feasible.  Another will be fixed-wireless internet installations, where 5G gear replaces a traditional wire-based home or business broadband internet service.  Cristiano Amon, who will take over as Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive in June, said the networks could offer a faster option for people who live in neighborhoods where fiber-optic internet service is not available.  \u201cWe now have the technology in place to start thinking about all those services beyond phones,\u201d Amon told reporters.  Amon said the X65 modem will be used in 40 different product designs for fixed-wireless gear from telecommunications carriers that will start hitting markets in the second half of 2021.

Qualcomm\u2019s board on Wednesday raised its own repurchase authorization to $30 billion.  Qualcomm shares rose 5 percent in trading before the bell on Thursday while NXP shares sank 10 percent - a level the company has not seen since Qualcomm made a bid for the company in October 2016.  \u201cThe decline in share price today partly reflects the failed acquisition but also disappointing Q2 results today,\u201d said CFRA analyst Angelo Zino.  \u201cWe see resuming buybacks as a positive but the company is unlikely to find another suitor giving the current landscape for M&A in the semiconductor industry.\u201d  A deal would have helped Qualcomm to lower its dependency on mobile chips by expanding NXP\u2019s position as the world\u2019s biggest maker of automotive electronics.  But the collapse of what would have been the biggest chip industry merger ever also leaves it free to concentrate on other problem areas of its business which promise more growth as well as resolving a series of legal conflicts over chip patents.  \u201cWhile we are disappointed the NXP merger was abandoned for the long-term operating business, at least now there is some strategic clarity,\u201d Cowen analysts wrote in a client note.  Growing resistance from customers to Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices has resulted in billions of dollars in regulatory fines, leaving the chipmaker searching for new ways to expand beyond its decade long dominance in chips for the mobile phone market, where growth has slowed.  With the NXP merger failing, Qualcomm now has to prove it can successfully diversify its business to move the overall financial needle, analysts said.  NXP, on the other hand, has to prove that the distraction caused by the deal did not hamper its growth prospects. The company will host its first earnings call in nearly two years on Thursday.

The move came as U.S. President Donald Trump slammed a $5 billion fine against Google, saying the European Union was taking advantage of the United States.  Qualcomm, the world\u2019s leading chipmaker, has been in the EU crosshairs since 2015 when it was charged with predatory pricing aimed at forcing out British phone software maker Icera between 2009 and 2011.

The company said its Snapdragon 855 mobile system on a chip (SoC) had gained a seal of approval from Germany\u2019s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), whose certification was \u201cknown to be very rigorous and globally recognized\u201d.  The first approval of its kind means smartphones packing the Qualcomm SoC are deemed to be as secure as smart cards. Almost half of the world\u2019s smartphones run on the company\u2019s chipsets.  The certification means applications that previously required separate security chips will now be possible using just Qualcomm\u2019s SoC system, potentially bolstering the U.S. company\u2019s market position.  \u201cSmartphones and tablets are today used for many applications that have high security demands, for example for payments, saving passwords, keys, sensitive information such as health data or two-factor authentication,\u201d said BSI president Arne Schoenbohm.  \u201cIn securing these devices, the trend is to an ever-increasing integration of elements.\u201d  Such applications are expected to become even more prevalent with the launch of 5G services.

The BSI certification, based on so-called Common Criteria (ISO\/IEC 15408), reflects the watchdog\u2019s view that the Qualcomm SoC - which is already in production - is strongly resilient against hacker attacks, the BSI said in a statement.","179":"(Drops extraneous word \u2018whose\u2019 in paragraph 9)  July 27 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc Chief Executive Officer Steven Mollenkopf sought government help to block an acquisition of the U.S. chip maker on fears of China\u2019s technological ascendance, only to see his biggest deal thwarted by China.  Now the 49-year-old former electrical engineer is under investor pressure to show that he can go it alone.  Several Qualcomm shareholders interviewed by Reuters said they were willing to give Mollenkopf, who has been CEO since March 2014, only one to two more years to show he can diversify the company\u2019s business beyond the fiercely competitive mobile phone sector that now accounts for the vast majority of its business, and settle disputes with Apple Inc and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.  \u201cMollenkopf is in the \u2018show me\u2019 phase of his tenure. I think he has about two years,\u201d said Tom Plumb, founder of Wisconsin Capital Management, which has 2 percent of its equity portfolio allocated to Qualcomm.  Mollenkopf faces the consequences of a bold gambit. Earlier this year, Qualcomm asked the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals for potential national security risks, to review a $121 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm by rival Broadcom Ltd.  It was an unusual move, because typically only agreed deals are submitted for CFIUS review. If CFIUS took this up, it would be the U.S. government, not Qualcomm shareholders, that would decide its fate.  Qualcomm\u2019s maneuver worked. President Donald Trump blocked the deal in March, citing CFIUS\u2019s concerns over a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G wireless technology, even though Broadcom, which at the time was based in Singapore, was not a Chinese company.  Amid growing tensions with the United States over trade disputes, China responded by stalling on its antitrust review of Qualcomm\u2019s $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV , which the two companies had agreed in October 2016.  On Thursday, frustrated with Chinese regulators\u2019 seemingly endless delays, Qualcomm let the merger agreement with NXP expire and paid it a $2 billion breakup fee. NXP\u2019s strength in the automotive market had been expected to help Qualcomm reduce its dependence on the smartphone market.  Qualcomm now faces an uphill struggle in carrying out a transformative acquisition such as NXP in the near term, given that all major semiconductor peers have a footprint in China that would subject any acquisition to a China review.  Mollenkopf has acknowledged this, but told analysts on Wednesday that he believed big acquisitions would be possible again after this \u201cunusual window\u201d of trade tensions between the United States and China passed.  Without NXP, Mollenkopf will have to find ways to expand Qualcomm\u2019s chip offerings on its own into sectors such as automobiles, internet connectivity and network processing on its own, investors say.  \u201cQualcomm has a lot to prove and the markets are not giving it the benefit of the doubt,\u201d said Neuberger Berman associate portfolio manager Shawn Trudeau. Neuberger Berman\u2019s equity income fund owns $10 million in Qualcomm stock and has been an investor in the company for close to three years.  A Qualcomm spokeswoman said the company\u2019s earnings demonstrated \u201cthat the execution of the company has been very strong in a period of great distraction\u201d and that it had received positive feedback from investors from its standalone plan.  Mollenkopf has already faced questions internally about his leadership. In March, his predecessor, Paul Jacobs, stepped down from Qualcomm\u2019s board of directors to pursue a long-shot acquisition bid for Qualcomm, which has a market capitalization of $93 billion. His exit followed disagreements with Mollenkopf over his strategy, sources said at the time. Jacobs has yet to secure the funds to put together that offer.  Later in March, investor frustration spilled over into Qualcomm\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, when Mollenkopf was re-elected to the company\u2019s board with only 45 percent of the shares outstanding. Shareholder advisory firms such as Egan-Jones Proxy Services said that anything less than 80 to 90 percent of the vote would undermine the authority of Mollenkopf and other board directors.  Mollenkopf got a partial reprieve on Thursday, when Qualcomm shares closed up 7 percent, at $63.58, as investors cheered the $30 billion share buyback Qualcomm announced to make up for the loss of the NXP deal and celebrated the end of uncertainty.  However, Qualcomm\u2019s stock is still below the roughly $76.00 level it was hovering at when Mollenkopf became CEO about 4-1-2\/ years ago, and way below the $82-per-share offer from Broadcom that it rejected in February. Hal Eddins, chief economist at Qualcomm shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said this puts Mollenkopf under new pressure to improve performance.  \u201cWe obviously got caught up in something that was above us, so I don\u2019t know if I would conclude anything about our own business, our ability to invest [in China] or partner with Chinese companies,\u201d Mollenkopf told Reuters on Wednesday.  SETTLING WITH APPLE  Mollenkopf\u2019s immediate challenge is meeting Qualcomm\u2019s goal for up to $7.50 in adjusted earnings per share by fiscal 2019, compared with $4.28 in fiscal 2017. That hinges on resolving its licensing disputes with Huawei and Apple, as well as continuing to diversify revenue.  Parts of Qualcomm\u2019s global court battle with Apple are expected to come to a head in the fall and early next year, while Qualcomm and Huawei remain in talks to try to resolve their dispute.  Only 13.4 percent of Qualcomm\u2019s $22.3 billion in revenue in fiscal 2017 was not tied to mobile phones. This year, Mollenkopf expects Qualcomm\u2019s non-mobile revenue to hit $5 billion, or about 22 percent of the $22 billion in overall revenue at the low end of the company\u2019s guidance.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Qualcomm\u2019s response raises the stakes in a battle over what would be the technology sector\u2019s largest-ever acquisition. The two companies have less than three weeks to negotiate a potential deal until Qualcomm shareholders are asked to vote on a challenge by Broadcom to Qualcomm\u2019s board of directors.  Qualcomm has been seeking to walk a fine line between resisting Broadcom\u2019s acquisition approach, which it says undervalues it and is fraught with regulatory risks, and demonstrating to its shareholders and proxy advisory firms that it is willing to engage to secure a better deal if possible.  \u201cWhile the current Broadcom proposal is unacceptable, our board is intensely focused on maximizing value for Qualcomm stockholders, whether through executing on its growth strategy or by selling the company,\u201d Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs wrote to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan on Friday in a letter released by Qualcomm.  Broadcom offered no immediate comment. Qualcomm shares were up 0.4 percent at $65.60, significantly below Broadcom\u2019s latest $82 per share cash-and-stock offer. Broadcom shares were down 0.8 percent at $249.89.  Qualcomm\u2019s meeting with Broadcom on Feb. 14 was the first time the two companies met to discuss a potential combination since Broadcom unveiled its unsolicited bid last November.  As part of the takeover battle, Broadcom is asking Qualcomm shareholders to back its effort to replace a majority of Qualcomm\u2019s board of directors in a vote scheduled for March 6. It has called its latest bid its best and final offer.  \u201cWhile it sounds like the parties remain very far apart on the specifics (price, risk mitigation, etc), actual negotiations (with an understanding of opening positions) do appear to have kicked off, and Qualcomm is at least contemplating the bare possibility that they might get sold,\u201d analyst Stacy Rasgon at Bernstein said.  In the meeting this week, Singapore-based Broadcom was willing to make certain divestitures to satisfy antitrust regulators, but was still resistant to \u201cother commitments that could be expected\u201d to be required by government regulatory bodies, Qualcomm said.  Broadcom has already said it is willing to sell two Qualcomm businesses to resolve any antitrust problems. These are its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones.  In the meeting, Broadcom agreed to divest if needed its own Wi-Fi business, instead of Qualcomm\u2019s, a source familiar with the confidential details of the meeting said.  Broadcom also wanted Qualcomm to include in the merger agreement that Qualcomm will refrain from lawsuits related to licensing while the deal is being reviewed by regulators, according to the source. Qualcomm did not agree to that.  Qualcomm reiterated that Broadcom\u2019s promised breakup fee of $8 billion in the event regulators thwart the deal did not come close to compensating for risks related to the deal.  NXP DEAL  The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices.  Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily outsources the manufacturing of its chips which are used for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  Qualcomm is currently seeking to complete a $38 billion deal to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O. NXP shares are trading at around $119, significantly above Qualcomm's $110 per share offer, as some NXP shareholders, led by activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, have called on Qualcomm to raise its price.  Broadcom has said its acquisition offer is contingent on either Qualcomm buying NXP at currently disclosed terms of $110 per share in cash or the deal being terminated.  China\u2019s MOFCOM is the only regulator around the world that has yet to approve the Qualcomm-NXP deal. With the start of the Chinese New Year public holiday this week, Qualcomm could potentially delay its decision on raising its offer for NXP until after the March 6 Qualcomm shareholder meeting.","182":"Feb 16 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc is open to discussing a buyout offer from Broadcom Ltd that \u201creflects the true value\u201d of the chipmaker and better addresses concerns about regulatory hurdles to a deal, the company said on Friday.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  A U.S. International Trade Commission judge said Apple\u2019s phones infringed one Qualcomm patent related to power management technology, but denied the chipmaker\u2019s request for a ban on the import of some iPhones into the United States.  Thomas Pender, an administrative law judge at the ITC, said that \u201cpublic interest factors\u201d weighed against granting Qualcomm\u2019s request for a ban.  The determination will be reviewed by other judges. Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has another pending patent case against Apple before the ITC.  Apple said in a statement that Qualcomm had unfairly demanded royalties for technologies it had nothing to do with.  \u201cWe\u2019re glad the ITC stopped Qualcomm\u2019s attempt to damage competition and ultimately harm innovators and U.S. consumers,\u201d Apple said.  In a statement, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said the company was pleased the judge did find patent infringement, but \u201cit makes no sense to then allow infringement to continue by denying an import ban.  \u201cThat goes against the ITC mandate to protect American innovators by blocking the import of infringing products,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cThere are many ways Apple could stop infringing our technology without affecting the public interest.\u201d  Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  San Diego, California-based Qualcomm initiated an ITC case against Apple in July 2017, alleging that iPhones containing Intel chips infringed six patents describing technology that helps smartphones perform well without draining the battery.  Qualcomm did not allege that Intel chips violate its patents, but claimed that the way Apple implemented them in the iPhone does.  In a blog post on Friday after the ITC decision, Intel\u2019s general counsel, Steven Rodgers, said Qualcomm had \u201cpublicly disparaged Intel\u2019s products\u201d as inferior to Qualcomm\u2019s during the case.  \u201cIt is easy to say things, but Intel\u2019s track record is clear,\u201d Rodgers wrote in his post. \u201cEvery day, we push the boundaries of computing and communication technologies. And, the proof is in the pudding: last year, the U.S. Patent Office awarded more patents to Intel than to Qualcomm.\u201d  The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the U.S. market than federal courts can.  Qualcomm dropped three of the six patents from the case before a trial that began in June.  Pender said in Friday\u2019s decision that Apple infringed only one of the three patents remaining in the case.","184":"July 29 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Wednesday forecast fourth-quarter revenue largely above Wall Street expectations, powered by strong sales of more lucrative 5G devices despite a weak overall smartphone market.

Slideshow ( 5 images )  The system, dubbed Snapdragon Ride, is the company\u2019s first foray into a full system to power self-driving cars.  San Diego-based Qualcomm, known best as the world\u2019s biggest mobile phone chip supplier, has been a major automotive supplier for more than a decade, but primarily for the modem chips that connect vehicles to the internet and chips for the infotainment systems that power screens inside vehicles.  Qualcomm has spent years developing self-driving technology near its headquarters in virtual silence while rivals such as Intel Corp INTC.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O jumped into the market, spending billions on acquisitions supplying major automakers for autonomous driving.  Patrick Little, the senior vice president and general manager of Qualcomm\u2019s automotive business, said the company is using the expertise it built in the mobile phone processor business developing powerful processors that consume little electricity and generate little heat.  Qualcomm\u2019s new computers can fit in one hand and do not need fans or liquid cooling systems to prevent them from overheating. Lower power consumption will become important in electric vehicles, in which computers will have to compete with the drive train for battery power.  \u201cMany of these cars have a supercomputer in the back. It looks like your kid\u2019s gaming PC,\u201d Little told Reuters in an interview. \u201cNow imagine you\u2019re putting that in the trunk of an electric vehicle. Now your range anxiety is just doubled.\u201d  Qualcomm has also broken the system into pieces of hardware and software that can be scaled up or down for various needs from automakers. A smaller version of the computer can be used for simpler tasks like lane-control, or the computers can be chained together for full self-driving. Little said Qualcomm has used test vehicles in San Diego to develop its own set of self-driving software algorithms if automakers want to use them, but that it will be up to each one.  \u201cIf they came to us with their own software stack, or even somebody else\u2019s software stack, we\u2019re happy to say we\u2019ll help you\u201d adapt it to Qualcomm\u2019s hardware, he said.

REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in a closely watched case the regulator brought against Qualcomm in early 2017.  San Diego, California-based Qualcomm supplies modem chips that connect phones and other devices to wireless data networks, but patent licensing drives most of its profits.  The company is fighting a May 2019 decision by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh. That judge sided with antitrust regulators, writing that Qualcomm\u2019s practice of requiring phone makers to sign a patent license agreement before selling them chips \u201cstrangled competition\u201d and harmed consumers.  The panel of judges probed the FTC on how Qualcomm may have violated antitrust laws, even if the company did use its dominant position in the chip market to gain higher patent royalties.  \u201cAnticompetitive behavior is prohibited under the Sherman Act. Hyper-competitive behavior is not. This case asks us to draw the line between the two,\u201d Judge Stephen Joseph Murphy III said.  The FTC argued Qualcomm applied an excessive \u201csurcharge\u201d to phone makers, charging them too high a price for patent licenses because the phone makers had to sign the deals to get Qualcomm\u2019s chips.  \u201cDoesn\u2019t the Supreme Court say that patent holders have the right to price their patents? What would be anticompetitive about that?\u201d Judge Johnnie Rawlinson asked.  Brian Fletcher, a law professor from Stanford University brought in by the FTC, responded that phone makers could not challenge the patent prices in negotiations or other court proceedings for fear of losing access to Qualcomm\u2019s chips.  Judge Consuelo Mar\u00eda Callahan asked whether the FTC\u2019s case had conflated profits with anticompetitive behavior. She asked Qualcomm\u2019s attorney if Qualcomm\u2019s practices \u201chelped Qualcomm make lots of money for a few years, is that in and of itself an antitrust violation, even if consumers paid higher prices for cell phones?\u201d  Representing Qualcomm, Tom Goldstein responded no. He conceded Qualcomm was a monopoly, but argued that it broke no laws because its chips were better than rivals.  \u201cIt is the prospect that a monopolist will make a lot of money that encourages it to do so much innovation. That is what capitalism is intended to encourage,\u201d he said.  A decision in the appeal could take anywhere from several months to more than a year.","187":"SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - The two largest smart phone makers in the world supply a majority of their own modem chips to help their devices connect to wireless data networks, according to evidence presented at an antitrust trial for chip supplier Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Qualcomm is seen during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 27, 2018. REUTERS\/Yves Herman\/File Photo  A trial between the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Qualcomm kicked off in a federal courtroom in California on Friday, with the regulators arguing that Qualcomm engaged in anticompetitive patent licensing practices to preserve a monopoly on modem chips. The case is being closely watched because it may shed light on the likely eventual outcome of the global legal battle between Apple Inc AAPL.O and Qualcomm.  Apple has alleged that Qualcomm engaged in illegal business practices, and Qualcomm in turn has alleged Apple violated its patents, scoring victories in China and Germany last month.  Qualcomm has argued its licensing practices follow long-established industry norms and that it charges broadly the same licensing rates that it had for many years before it ever started selling chips.  That has become a big market for Qualcomm, which controlled 59.6 percent of the $15.3 billion market for 4G modem chips in 2017, according to IDC\u2019s Phil Solis, who studies mobile chips for the research firm.  But Bob Van Nest, an attorney representing Qualcomm in the case, also sought to show that Qualcomm is not dominant in the world\u2019s two biggest handset makers.  During opening arguments, Van Nest's presentation said that Huawei [HWT.UL] internally sources 54 percent of the modem chips it puts in its devices and gets only 22 percent of its modems from Qualcomm, with the remainder coming from other unnamed makers. Samsung 005930.KS internally sources 52 percent of the modem chips it uses, with 38 percent from Qualcomm and the rest from other makers, according to the presentation.  Huawei and Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also, the FTC\u2019s case centers not on the overall modem chip market - which includes slower chips that go into cheaper handsets - but rather the market for speedy \u201cpremium\u201d chips where Qualcomm is among the only options.  Huawei and Samsung are both large diversified technology corporations that make many other products aside from premium-priced smart phones. Huawei\u2019s HiSilicon unit supplies the chips for its high-end phones such as its Mate and P series. Samsung\u2019s chip division supplies processors and other components for many of its handsets and is also a dominant global supplier of memory chips beyond its own products.  The two firms are also Apple's fiercest rivals in the market for premium smart phones costing $700 or more. Apple depends entirely on Intel Corp INTC.O and Qualcomm for modem chips, though the iPhones released in 2018 use Intel modems exclusively.  Technology news publication The Information last month reported here that Apple was designing its own modem chip, citing Apple job listings and a source briefed on Apple's plans. Apple declined to comment on its plans.  For the second quarter of 2018 - the most recent figures available from IDC - Apple was the third-largest smart phone supplier by volume, with Samsung and Huawei in first and second place, respectively.","188":"SAN FRANCISCO\/SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's 005930.KS semiconductor manufacturing division has won a contract to make new Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O 5G chips using its most advanced chip-making technology, two sources familiar with the matter said, boosting the Korean firm's efforts to gain market share against rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 5425.TWO.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Samsung Electronics is seen at its office building in Seoul, South Korea, July 4, 2017. REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji\/File Photo  Samsung will fabricate at least some of Qualcomm\u2019s X60 modem chips, which will connect devices such as smart phones to 5G wireless data networks. The X60 will be made on Samsung\u2019s 5-nanometer process, the sources said, which makes the chips smaller and more power-efficient than previous generations.  One of the sources said TSMC is also expected to fabricate 5-nanometer modems for Qualcomm. Samsung and Qualcomm declined to comment, and TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Best known among consumers for its phones and other electronic devices, Samsung is the world's second-biggest chip manufacturer through its foundry division, self-supplying many of its own mobile phone parts and also fabricating chips for outside customers such as International Business Machines Corp IBM.N and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, among others.  But much of Samsung\u2019s semiconductor revenue historically has come from memory chips, whose prices can swing wildly as supply and demand fluctuate. In an attempt to cut its reliance on that volatile market, Samsung announced a plan last year to invest $116 billion in non-memory chips through 2030.  The Qualcomm deal shows progress in winning customers to that effort. Even if Samsung has won only part of the orders, Qualcomm represents a flagship customer for Samsung\u2019s 5-nanometer manufacturing technology. Samsung plans to ramp up that technology this year in an attempt to regain market share against TSMC, which is also starting mass production of 5-nanonmeter chips this year.  The Qualcomm win could boost Samsung\u2019s foundry business because the X60 modem is likely to be used in many mobile devices as they shift to 5G. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Samsung had 17.8% market share versus TSMC\u2019s 52.7%, according to data from TrendForce.  In a separate announcement, Qualcomm said on Tuesday it would begin sending samples of the X60 chips to customers in the first quarter of this year. Qualcomm did not disclose who would manufacture the chips, and Reuters could not learn whether the first batches of chips would be made by Samsung or TSMC.  The Taiwanese company was faster to ramp up high-volume production of chips using the previous 7-nanometer manufacturing process, winning customers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O.  Last month, TSMC executives said they expect to begin ramping up 5-nanometer production in the first half of the year and expect it to make up 10% of the company\u2019s revenue for 2020.  Asked during a January investor conference call how Samsung will compete with TSMC, Shawn Han, senior vice president at Samsung Foundry, said the company planned to expand 5-nanometer mass production by \u201cdiversifying customer applications\u201d this year.  Qualcomm designs its own chips but works with outside companies to manufacture them. It has used manufacturing services from both Samsung and TSMC in the past, as well as from China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp 0981.HK, depending on which foundry's technology and pricing met its needs for the product at hand.","189":"Feb 20 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc:  * QUALCOMM ENTERS INTO AMENDED DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH NXP  * INCREASES DEAL PRICE TO $127.50 IN CASH PER SHARE  * QUALCOMM REAFFIRMS HIGH CONFIDENCE IN FISCAL 2019 NON-GAAP EPS OF $6.75-$7.50  * AMENDED AGREEMENT ALSO LOWERS MINIMUM TENDER CONDITION FROM 80% OF NXP\u2019S OUTSTANDING SHARES TO 70%  * INTENDS TO FUND ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION WITH CASH ON HAND AND NEW DEBT  * QUALCOMM RIVER HOLDINGS B.V.

The San Diego-based chip supplier forecast revenue for its fiscal second quarter largely above Wall Street estimates, in the latest sign that the protracted slowdown in the global chip industry is easing.  The forecast was wider than usual because of the outbreak in China, which has killed hundreds and sparked fears around the world. The company lowered the bottom end of its earnings-per-share guidance by 5 cents to account for possible disruptions, Palkhiwala said.

We want to make sure that we maintain that strength across different markets.\u201d  But investors\u2019 virus worries overshadowed results that otherwise beat expectations.  While it is dominant in mobile modems and processors, Qualcomm has been pushing to win over customers with the kind of chip called a radio-frequency front end that is more complex in phones that use 5G. Even though it forecast fewer modem sales than Wall Street expected, it generated more revenue per modem shipped than in the past.  In an interview, Mollenkopf said the company\u2019s forecast reflected strong demand for radiofrequency chips from phone makers, especially in China, where brands are putting 5G capabilities into cheaper devices that will sell in greater quantities sooner than Qualcomm had originally anticipated.  \u201cIt\u2019s really the first time that you\u2019re seeing that significantly in our numbers,\u201d Mollenkopf said.  Qualcomm left its estimate of the number of 5G mobile handsets that will be sold in 2020 unchanged at between 175 million and 225 million.  Qualcomm forecast total revenue in the range of between $4.9 billion and $5.7 billion for its second quarter, the mid-point of which is largely above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $5.08 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  It forecast revenue for its chip segment of $3.9 billion to $4.5 billion, versus estimates of $3.8 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

In recent years Amon has overseen the company\u2019s chip division, which supplies processors to most Android phones and modem chips that help Android devices and Apple Inc\u2019s iPhones connect to wireless data networks.  A strong proponent of 5G, the new generation of faster wireless networks, he has led Qualcomm\u2019s push to put 5G chips into low and mid-priced handsets.

But Amon, who also played a role in Qualcomm\u2019s licensing division as company president, will face some tough challenges as CEO, such as how to deal with Qualcomm\u2019s heavy reliance on intellectual property from Arm Ltd for its processor chips.  Arm is in the middle of a $40 billion takeover by Nvidia Corp, which has a brewing rivalry with Qualcomm in chips for artificial intelligence.  Amon could be forced to find a replacement for Arm\u2019s intellectual property if Qualcomm concludes that depending on a competitor creates too much long-term risk.  Qualcomm has already started using more of its own intellectual property in chips for artificial intelligence and is using an Arm alternative called RISC-V in certain parts of its phone processors.  Qualcomm designs chips but outsources their manufacturing, largely to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co in Taiwan and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in Korea. U.S. lawmakers recently approved a program to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Amon said Qualcomm, which has huge sway with chip factories because of its sales volume, plans to retain its outsourcing strategy but would consider future U.S. factories.  \u201cWe\u2019re one of the few companies that actually have multi-sourcing on the leading node.

(Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru)","195":"(Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc's QCOM.O quarterly profit and revenue topped Wall Street forecasts, suggesting that a slowdown in the global smartphone business might be less severe than feared after a string of weak forecasts from suppliers.  FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The results announced in Qualcomm's smartphone chip business contrasted to those from major mobile phone components makers in Asia, including TSMC 2330.TW and SK Hynix Inc 000660.KS, which have warned of slower growth in their smartphone chip divisions.  While revenue from Qualcomm's chips division - its largest - rose 6 percent in the three months ended March 25, revenue from the licensing business plunged 44 percent, reflecting the withholding of revenue in a high-profile patent battle with Apple Inc AAPL.O.  Despite the strong quarter for chip sales, the company does see some signs of weakness.  It forecast growth of about 5 percent in modern mobile handsets for the remainder of the year, which is lower than anticipated. Handset prices, however, are higher than expected.  \u201cQualcomm posted solid results, but its guidance pointed to a softer handset market, particularly in China,\u201d said Moody\u2019s Senior Vice President Rick Lane.  Qualcomm also is waiting for Chinese regulators to consider its application to buy chipmaker NXP, a deal that Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf expects to go through. If it does not, Qualcomm plans to use the cash dedicated to the deal for a share buy-back. The deal was held up by diplomatic concerns between countries, rather than Qualcomm-specific concerns, he said.  The biggest spat is over a U.S. ban on exports to China's ZTE Corp 000063.SZ after it was caught exporting to Iran. Qualcomm said it expects the loss of business with ZTE to lower its profits by 3 cents per share next quarter, though executives also suggested that other smart phone makers that it also does business with may make up for that lost revenue in the longer term.  The results come as San Diego-based Qualcomm tries to convince shareholders it can boost earnings by cutting annual costs by $1 billion and resolving the Apple dispute.  Qualcomm on Wednesday forecast current-quarter revenue of between $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, and adjusted earnings of 65 to 75 cents per share. Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.32 billion and earnings of 75 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Qualcomm\u2019s quarterly net income fell to $363 million, or 24 cents per share, from $749 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items, Qualcomm earned 80 cents per share, ahead of analysts\u2019 average estimate of 70 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Total revenue rose 4.9 percent to $5.26 billion, topping expectations of $5.19 billion.  Qualcomm shares rose 1 percent to $50.25 in after-hours trading on Wednesday.  The sentiment also appeared to help boost other chipmakers in after-hours trading, with memory chipmaker Micron Technology MU.O up 1 percent to $48.12 after the announcement.","196":"Feb 8 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc:  * QUALCOMM BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY REJECTS REVISED BROADCOM PROPOSAL  * QUALCOMM BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY REJECTS REVISED BROADCOM PROPOSAL  * QUALCOMM INC - QUALCOMM OFFERS TO MEET TO SEE IF BROADCOM CAN ADDRESS SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES IN VALUE AND CERTAINTY  * QUALCOMM INC - QUALCOMM BOARD, ASSISTED BY ITS FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ADVISORS, DETERMINED THAT BROADCOM PROPOSAL MATERIALLY \u201cUNDERVALUES\u201d QUALCOMM  * QUALCOMM INC - BROADCOM PROPOSAL FALLS \u201cWELL SHORT OF FIRM REGULATORY COMMITMENT\u201d BOARD WOULD DEMAND GIVEN SIGNIFICANT DOWNSIDE RISK OF A FAILED DEAL Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","197":"FILE PHOTO: U.S. Sen.

FILE PHOTO: A woman walks past a sign advertising Qualcomm at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Shanghai, China June 28, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  In an interview on Wednesday, Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf told Reuters Huawei had stolen market share mainly from its domestic rivals such as Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK, Oppo and Vivo, all of which are major Qualcomm customers.  Huawei\u2019s advance has spurred other phone makers to cancel 4G models planned for the rest of this year and instead focus on 5G models for release early next year that could drive growth for Qualcomm, he added.  \u201cHuawei was very aggressive in terms of making sure they built their market share there because they couldn\u2019t sell things internationally,\u201d Mollenkopf said. \u201cAnd the reaction of the (other Chinese phone makers) was, \u2018Let\u2019s go as fast as we can to 5G, because there\u2019s a great opportunity there,\u2019 even to the point of saying, \u2018Let\u2019s cancel 4G models.\u2019\u201d  Mollenkopf said Qualcomm will not see benefits from that shift until early 2020 but said 5G rollouts by carriers appeared to be on track, including in China where Huawei is also a major telecommunications gear supplier. KinNgai Chan, an analyst at Summit Insights Group, called Qualcomm\u2019s outlook a \u201cpause in 4G ahead of the transition to 5G.\u201d  Huawei\u2019s effect on Qualcomm\u2019s forecast underscores the extent to which the Chinese company has become more of a rival than a customer to the San Diego-based company. Huawei, which was the subject of U.S. sales restrictions imposed in May, continues to buy a small number of Qualcomm chips.  But the companies, which are among the world\u2019s largest holders of patents related to 5G technology, are in a protracted licensing dispute. Huawei had been making good-faith payments and negotiations have inched forward, but Mollenkopf said no further payments are included in Qualcomm\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter guidance.  \u201cThe companies are talking and we\u2019re focused on a final agreement, but we don\u2019t have it yet,\u201d Mollenkopf said.  Huawei supplies many of its own chips for smartphones, and it grabbed market share from Chinese companies over the past quarter, according to market research firm Canalys. Those companies\u2019 higher-end phones, which compete against directly with Huawei\u2019s models, tend to use Qualcomm chips.  Mollenkopf said the U.S.-China trade war and a slow smartphone market drove Qualcomm to lower its outlook for 2019 sales of smart devices to a range of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion, down from a previous estimate of 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion.  Qualcomm collects license fees from smartphone makers for using its patents.  The company\u2019s modem chip shipments fell 22% to 156 million in the third quarter, missing analysts\u2019 estimate of 160.1 million, according to FactSet.  Apple Inc AAPL.O and Qualcomm settled all their litigation in April. Apple signed a six-year patent license deal with Qualcomm, as well as a multi-year chip supply agreement.  The two have not said when Apple would resume using Qualcomm's chips in iPhones after dropping them in favor of Intel Corp's INTC.O chips for 2018 iPhone models.  Apple last week bought Intel\u2019s modem business to help supply its own smartphone chips. Mollenkopf told Reuters the company had expected such a deal when negotiating its agreement with the iPhone maker, but Apple\u2019s purchase had no effect on Qualcomm\u2019s fourth quarter outlook.  \u201cThis was something everybody assumed,\u201d Mollenkopf said. \u201cAnd we protected ourselves and feel very good about continuing to be able to compete\u201d for Apple\u2019s business, he added.  Qualcomm forecast total fourth-quarter revenue of $4.3 billion to $5.1 billion and profit of 65 cents and 75 cents per share, below estimates of $5.63 billion and $1.08 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Qualcomm is also seeking to pause the enforcement of a sweeping antitrust decision in a case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The company has said the ruling could upend its licensing talks with handset makers around 5G technology.  Revenue for the third quarter ended June 30 was $4.9 billion, missing analysts\u2019 estimates of $5.08 billion. That excluded a one-time payment from Apple for unpaid royalties while the two were in a legal dispute.  Excluding items, Qualcomm earned 80 cents per share, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of 75 cents.","200":"FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is seen during the China International Import Expo (CIIE), at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 6, 2018.

The regional court in the city of Mannheim dismissed the Qualcomm suit as groundless in an initial verbal decision, saying the patent in question was not violated by the installation of its chips in Apple\u2019s smartphones.  Qualcomm, waging a worldwide patent battle with Apple, said it would appeal after winning a separate case before a court in Munich in December that enabled it to enforce a ban on the sale of older iPhones in Germany.  \u201cApple has a history of infringing our patents,\u201d said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s executive vice president and general counsel.  \u201cWhile we disagree with the Mannheim court\u2019s decision and will appeal, we will continue to enforce our (intellectual property) rights against Apple worldwide.\u201d  Apple declined to comment on the Mannheim decision. It referred to a statement issued in response to the Dec. 20 ruling in Munich, against which it is appealing.  Apple said at the time that, while a decision on the Munich appeal is outstanding, it would no longer stock the iPhone 7 and 8 at its 15 retail outlets in Germany, although its newer models would remain on sale.  All of its models remain available through carriers and resellers. Gravis, the leading Apple reseller in Germany, said on Tuesday it continued to stock the full range of iPhones.  Apart from the German order, Qualcomm has also secured a ban on the sale of some iPhones in China. Apple, which is also contesting that ruling, has continued to offer its iPhones in China but made changes to its iOS operating system following the order.  Qualcomm, meanwhile, faces a U.S. antitrust case brought by the Federal Trade Commission which accuses it of abusing a monopoly on mobile chip technology in a trial that could have a major impact on the smartphone industry.  If the government prevails in the trial that began on Jan. 4, Qualcomm could be forced to change its practices for licensing a trove of patents to device makers like Apple.  Apple is closely watching the FTC case, as it has its own pending lawsuit making similar claims against Qualcomm. (Reporting by Douglas Busvine Editing by Keith Weir)","203":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday showed just how far the company is willing to go to preserve one of its core business practices of taking a cut of the selling price of phones.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The San Diego-based chipmaker posted quarterly profit and revenue that topped Wall Street forecasts, suggesting that a slowdown in the global smartphone business might be less severe than feared after a string of weak forecasts from other industry suppliers.  But Qualcomm\u2019s other line of business - licensing a trove of patents that help make smart phones work - has traditionally driven most of its profits. And that business has dropped sharply over the past year, as revenue attributable to Apple Inc iPhones is withheld amid a legal dispute.  Qualcomm gave two indications on Wednesday it was prepared to accept lower revenue in exchange for maintaining the business structure and avoiding future customer disputes.  Most Qualcomm licensing revenue is calculated as a percentage of the selling price of a smartphone. That so-called device-level licensing model has been at the center of regulatory disputes in China, Korea and the United States and also in its disputes with Apple.  On Wednesday, Qualcomm said it would cap the phone price that is the basis of the revenue calculation at $400. More expensive phones, which can sell for $1,000, would still be treated as $400 for the purpose of the Qualcomm license fee.  That move follows a Qualcomm decision in November to license some patents that are required for connecting to so-called 5G networks, the next generation of mobile data networks, at a rate of 3.25 percent.  The net effect is that Qualcomm keeps its device-level licensing model and likely accepts less revenue, said Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan.  \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper for most people,\u201d Chan said. \u201cWhat Qualcomm is trying to do is ... get everyone to sign a licensing agreement with them so they don\u2019t have to worry too much.\u201d  When Qualcomm executives were asked directly by an analyst on the post-earnings conference call whether the company would receive less revenue from 5G patents, they disputed the notion.  \u201cWe\u2019re not getting paid less for it,\u201d said Alex Rogers, Qualcomm\u2019s licensing chief. \u201cI think the best way to think about this is building a foundation for long-term stability\u201d for Qualcomm\u2019s licensing business.  Chan said that a recent deal with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd also appeared to show that the rate was lower. In February, Qualcomm said it had amended a 2009 Samsung agreement with a new licensing rate as part of a deal to settle a regulatory dispute in Korea.  Qualcomm cut its licensing forecast by $300 million for the third quarter and Chief Financial Officer George Davis said just under half of the change was due to changes in arrangements with Samsung and other moves. That, said Chan, indicated a cheaper deal for Samsung.  Samsung mentioned the late-January cross-licensing deal amendment with Qualcomm in earnings call on Thursday Asian time, but said it could not reveal any monetary figures due to confidential agreement. Samsung said that \u201cthe effect will be limited to future revenue, and there were no one-off reversals of provisioning (during the first quarter).\u201d","204":"April 18 (Reuters) -  * QUALCOMM INC.

Qualcomm said it will immediately ask the judge to put the decision on hold and seek a quick appeal to the federal appeals court in California.  \u201cWe strongly disagree with the judge\u2019s conclusions, her interpretation of the facts and her application of the law,\u201d general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement.

Steve Mollenkopf (Qualcomm CEO) conceded at trial that Qualcomm does not sell chips to unlicensed OEMs.\u201d  ** \u201cQualcomm\u2019s exclusive dealing agreements have foreclosed Qualcomm\u2019s rivals from a substantial share of the CDMA and premium LTE modem chip markets.\u201d  ** \u201cTo permit Qualcomm to continue to charge unreasonably high royalty rates would perpetuate its artificial surcharge on rivals\u2019 chips, which harms rivals, OEMs, and consumers, and would enable Qualcomm to continue to reap the fruits of its Sherman Act violation. Thus, the court finds it necessary to require Qualcomm to renegotiate those license agreements.\u201d  ** \u201cQualcomm\u2019s own documents show that Qualcomm knew its licensing practices could lead to antitrust liability, knew its licensing practices violate FRAND, and knew its licensing practices harm competition, yet continued anyway \u2014 even in the face of government investigations in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, the European Union, and the United States.  This evidence of Qualcomm\u2019s intent confirms the court\u2019s conclusion that Qualcomm\u2019s practices cause anticompetitive harm because \u2018no monopolist monopolizes unconscious of what he is doing\u2019.\u201d ** \u201cIn addition, even though Intel is supplying modem chips to Apple, Aicha Evans (Intel Chief Strategy Officer) testified that Intel has never met its target margins and that Intel\u2019s sales of modem chips to Apple have not yet been profitable.

FILE PHOTO: Samsung Electronics' Exynos 9 series mobile processor chips are seen in this undated handout picture provided by Samsung on May 14, 2018. Samsung Electronics\/Handout via REUTERS  The South Korean tech giant generates the bulk of its profit from its basic memory chips and has been beefing up development of logic chips such as mobile processors, image sensors and automotive chips to diversify.  Its flagship Exynos mobile chips power Samsung\u2019s Galaxy line of smartphones, but the chipset has only one external smartphone client - China\u2019s Meizu Technology.  \u201cWe are talking to all OEMs,\u201d Inyup Kang, head of Samsung\u2019s logic chip developer called System LSI, told Reuters in an interview, referring to original equipment manufacturers.  Kang, a former Qualcomm executive, said he expects to announce a new client for its Exynos chipsets in the first half of 2019.  Its search for new clients for the Exynos chips comes as the United States banned its companies from selling components to China\u2019s ZTE for seven years after it violated the terms of a settlement deal for illegally shipping goods made with U.S. parts to Iran and North Korea.  That has created urgency for ZTE to diversify its suppliers, analysts said, although attempts to resolve the issue have picked up some pace after U.S. President Donald Trump pledged on Sunday to help ZTE \u201cget back into business, fast\u201d.  Samsung later said in a statement to Reuters that there is no certainty a deal will be reached with ZTE, and its policy is to treat all vendors equally.  Its efforts like that will put further pressure on the industry leader Qualcomm, which said last month it expects the loss of business with ZTE to lower its profits by 3 cents per share next quarter.  Samsung is ranked far behind competitors Qualcomm and Apple in mobile processing chips, but the use of Exynos chips by its own smartphone business helped it become the fastest growing player in the segment, according to research firm Counterpoint.  Samsung\u2019s System LSI business saw a 27 percent rise in shipments last year, Counterpoint says.  Qualcomm also faces competition from Chinese companies such as Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], which uses its own processing chips called HiSilicon in its flagship smartphones.  CHIPS FOR AUTOS  As the smartphone market slows, Samsung\u2019s logic chip division also plans to seek growth in new fields such as fifth-generation mobile network technology (5G) and automotive, Kang said.  He said Samsung is in discussion with multiple automobile companies to develop chips for autonomous driving, declining to name the car makers. It said in January that it is providing automaker Audi with Exynos processor chips.  System LSI still uses Samsung\u2019s foundry for all of its manufacturing needs, but is in talks with other contract manufacturers to diversify production in areas Samsung\u2019s foundry isn\u2019t prepared for yet, such as high-voltage automotive products, Kang said.  TSMC is the world\u2019s top contract chip manufacturer, followed by the likes of U.S.-based Global Foundries, Taiwan-based UMC and Samsung.  Samsung\u2019s semiconductor business, reporting a 2017 operating profit of 35.2 trillion won ($33 billion), contributed more than 65 percent of the whole firm\u2019s record annual profit of 53.65 trillion won last year.  Out of this semiconductor business, memory chips contributed about 96 percent of the profits as it rode a \u201cboom\u201d cycle, while System LSI and foundry took up the rest with about 1.44 trillion won in 2017 operating profits, according to data from Mirae Asset Daewoo Securities.  Kang said his business is expected to see a 5-10 percent revenue growth this year in dollar terms. He declined to provide last year\u2019s growth rate.","209":"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O re-elected its board of directors on Friday with weak support from shareholders, who grilled the U.S. chipmaker over its strategy following its successful defense against a $117-billion hostile bid from Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O.  FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Qualcomm has been under pressure to defend its decision to take Broadcom\u2019s bid to a U.S. national security panel for review. This resulted in U.S. President Donald Trump blocking the deal earlier this month over concerns the acquisition would set the United States back in its race against China to develop 5G wireless technology.  The re-election of Qualcomm\u2019s directors was not in doubt on Friday given that Trump had ordered Broadcom to drop its challenge to Qualcomm\u2019s board and withdraw its nominees. However, the investor support the Qualcomm directors received was lower than in most cases where directors run for election unopposed.  Some of the directors were elected with more than 50 percent of the vote. The rest, including Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf, received support in the range of 40 percent to 50 percent, according to sources familiar with preliminary results of the shareholder vote.  \u201cAnything below 80 percent to 90 percent of votes cast is kind of questionable, 40 percent is very questionable. (Trump)has created some breathing room for Qualcomm. Hopefully, they will use it wisely and improve both their Board and company,\u201d said Kevin McManus, vice president and director of proxy services for Egan-Jones Proxy Services.  Ahead of Friday\u2019s meeting, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc, a shareholder advisory firm, had urged investors to lodge protest votes for Broadcom\u2019s withdrawn board nominees, even though they would not be counted under the company\u2019s rules.  Mollenkopf told investors following the company's rejection of Broadcom's bid that he could achieve earnings per share of $6.75 to $7.50 in fiscal 2019, through a number of measures, including a $1-billion cost reduction program and the resolution of licensing disputes, including with Apple Inc AAPL.O.  One shareholder at the meeting asked whether Qualcomm planned to return some or all of its offshore cash to shareholders \u201cwho have seen the shares go up to $80 and now is at $55\u201d but \u201chave been faithful. How about a little of that (cash)?\u201d  Qualcomm CFO George Davis said the company's offshore cash was already earmarked for use in the company's $44-billion acquisition of chip maker NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O, which is pending clearance from Chinese regulator MOFCOM.  \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound close to $80,\u201d the shareholder responded. Davis pointed to the company\u2019s earnings goal for its fiscal 2019. \u201cThat probably sounds more like $80,\u201d Davis said.  SMALLER BOARD  Qualcomm last week said its board would shrink to 10 directors from 11 because former chairman Paul Jacobs, the son of Qualcomm\u2019s co-founder, would not be renominated for the board after disclosing his intention to pursue a long-shot bid to take the company private.  Qualcomm shares closed down 1.9 percent on Friday at $53.66.

In response to a shareholder question about MOFCOM\u2019s delay in approving the NXP deal, Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s legal chief, said that Qualcomm had been \u201cactively engaged\u201d with Chinese regulators \u201cas recently as this week.\u201d  Mollenkopf said he believed the company would close the NXP deal on schedule and noted he was headed to China for a conference immediately after the shareholder meeting. But in response to separate shareholder question about U.S.-China relations, he said Qualcomm has little visibility into broader trends between the two nations.  \u201cThis is a little bit of uncharted territory for all of us,\u201d Mollenkopf said. \u201cWe have developed a strong China-friendly, U.S.-friendly business model.\u201d  On Friday, Broadcom said its shareholders had voted to redomicile the company from Singapore to the United States. The company is hoping this will make its future acquisitions exempt from reviews from the U.S. security panel, known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.  However, Trump\u2019s order prohibiting a Broadcom bid for Qualcomm continues to apply even after the redomiciling to the United States.","210":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders in the U.S. options market braced for a large near-term move in the shares of chipmaker Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and NXP Semiconductors NXPI.O with hours to go before the deadline to get China's nod for a $44 billion deal.

REUTERS\/Steve Marcus\/File Photo  San Diego-based Qualcomm needs Chinese approval for the deal because the country accounted for nearly two-thirds of its global revenue last year, but Sino-U.S. trade tensions have raised the prospect that the deal could be scuppered.  Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, and Dutch chipmaker NXP said in April they would call off the deal if they were unable to win Chinese regulatory approval by midnight on Wednesday.  Options on NXP Semiconductors are primed for a nearly 11 percent swing in the share price in either direction by Friday, according to Thomson Reuters data.  \u201cThis is a big deal. It\u2019s a clear event on the calendar and we have seen options activity growing going into the announcement,\u201d said David Russell, vice president of content strategy TradeStation Securities in Chicago.  \u201cIf you look at most of the pricing, most people at this point appear to be positioning for upside in NXPI,\u201d said Russell, referring to recent trading activity.  On Wednesday, 100,000 NXP Semiconductors options contracts traded by 1:10 p.m. ET (1710 GMT), with contracts changing hands at 1.5 times the usual pace. Calls outnumbered puts three-to-one.  Qualcomm is also set to report third-quarter results after the close of trading on Wednesday. The options-implied move for Qualcomm is around 6 percent, compared with an eight-quarter average move of 3 percent.  Overall, NXP options traders\u2019 defensive stance has moderated in recent days.  Traders have also been adding to short bets on NXP since February. Total short interest stands at $772 million, with about 7.6 million shares sold short, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.  Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares with the hope of buying them back later at a lower price.  \u201cThere isn\u2019t a huge rush to short this name, to say that the deal isn\u2019t going to happen, but if you look at sentiment, there has been some active shorting ahead of this deal being finalized,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 in New York.  NXP shares were down 2.1 percent, while Qualcomm shares were down 0.7 percent, on Wednesday.","211":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O Chief Executive Officer Steven Mollenkopf sought government help to block an acquisition of the U.S. chip maker on fears of China's technological ascendance, only to see his biggest deal thwarted by China.  FILE PHOTO: Steven Mollenkopf, CEO of Qualcomm, attends the Wall Street Journal Digital conference in Laguna Beach, California, U.S. October 17, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Now the 49-year-old former electrical engineer is under investor pressure to show that he can go it alone.  Several Qualcomm shareholders interviewed by Reuters said they were willing to give Mollenkopf, who has been CEO since March 2014, only one to two more years to show he can diversify the company's business beyond the fiercely competitive mobile phone sector that now accounts for the vast majority of its business, and settle disputes with Apple Inc AAPL.O and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.  \u201cMollenkopf is in the \u2018show me\u2019 phase of his tenure. I think he has about two years,\u201d said Tom Plumb, founder of Wisconsin Capital Management, which has 2 percent of its equity portfolio allocated to Qualcomm.  Mollenkopf faces the consequences of a bold gambit. Earlier this year, Qualcomm asked the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals for potential national security risks, to review a $121 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm by rival Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O.  It was an unusual move, because typically only agreed deals are submitted for CFIUS review. If CFIUS took this up, it would be the U.S. government, not Qualcomm shareholders, that would decide its fate.  Qualcomm\u2019s maneuver worked. President Donald Trump blocked the deal in March, citing CFIUS\u2019s concerns over a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G wireless technology, even though Broadcom, which at the time was based in Singapore, was not a Chinese company.  Amid growing tensions with the United States over trade disputes, China responded by stalling on its antitrust review of Qualcomm's $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O, which the two companies had agreed in October 2016.  On Thursday, frustrated with Chinese regulators\u2019 seemingly endless delays, Qualcomm let the merger agreement with NXP expire and paid it a $2 billion breakup fee. NXP\u2019s strength in the automotive market had been expected to help Qualcomm reduce its dependence on the smartphone market.  Qualcomm now faces an uphill struggle in carrying out a transformative acquisition such as NXP in the near term, given that all major semiconductor peers have a footprint in China that would subject any acquisition to a China review.  Mollenkopf has acknowledged this, but told analysts on Wednesday that he believed big acquisitions would be possible again after this \u201cunusual window\u201d of trade tensions between the United States and China passed.  Without NXP, Mollenkopf will have to find ways to expand Qualcomm\u2019s chip offerings on its own into sectors such as automobiles, internet connectivity and network processing on its own, investors say.  \"Qualcomm has a lot to prove and the markets are not giving it the benefit of the doubt,\" said Neuberger Berman associate portfolio manager Shawn Trudeau. Neuberger Berman's equity income fund NBHAX.O owns $10 million in Qualcomm stock and has been an investor in the company for close to three years.  A Qualcomm spokeswoman said the company\u2019s earnings demonstrated \u201cthat the execution of the company has been very strong in a period of great distraction\u201d and that it had received positive feedback from investors from its standalone plan.  Mollenkopf has already faced questions internally about his leadership. In March, his predecessor, Paul Jacobs, stepped down from Qualcomm\u2019s board of directors to pursue a long-shot acquisition bid for Qualcomm, which has a market capitalization of $93 billion. His exit followed disagreements with Mollenkopf over his strategy, sources said at the time. Jacobs has yet to secure the funds to put together that offer.  Later in March, investor frustration spilled over into Qualcomm\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, when Mollenkopf was re-elected to the company\u2019s board with only 45 percent of the shares outstanding. Shareholder advisory firms such as Egan-Jones Proxy Services said that anything less than 80 to 90 percent of the vote would undermine the authority of Mollenkopf and other board directors.  Mollenkopf got a partial reprieve on Thursday, when Qualcomm shares closed up 7 percent, at $63.58, as investors cheered the $30 billion share buyback Qualcomm announced to make up for the loss of the NXP deal and celebrated the end of uncertainty.  However, Qualcomm\u2019s stock is still below the roughly $76.00 level it was hovering at when Mollenkopf became CEO about 4-1-2\/ years ago, and way below the $82-per-share offer from Broadcom that it rejected in February. Hal Eddins, chief economist at Qualcomm shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said this puts Mollenkopf under new pressure to improve performance.  \u201cWe obviously got caught up in something that was above us, so I don\u2019t know if I would conclude anything about our own business, our ability to invest [in China] or partner with Chinese companies,\u201d Mollenkopf told Reuters on Wednesday.  SETTLING WITH APPLE  Mollenkopf\u2019s immediate challenge is meeting Qualcomm\u2019s goal for up to $7.50 in adjusted earnings per share by fiscal 2019, compared with $4.28 in fiscal 2017. That hinges on resolving its licensing disputes with Huawei and Apple, as well as continuing to diversify revenue.  Parts of Qualcomm\u2019s global court battle with Apple are expected to come to a head in the fall and early next year, while Qualcomm and Huawei remain in talks to try to resolve their dispute.  Only 13.4 percent of Qualcomm\u2019s $22.3 billion in revenue in fiscal 2017 was not tied to mobile phones. This year, Mollenkopf expects Qualcomm\u2019s non-mobile revenue to hit $5 billion, or about 22 percent of the $22 billion in overall revenue at the low end of the company\u2019s guidance.  Mollenkopf \u201cis on the clock for sure, and I\u2019m not certain that the NXP buy would have changed that,\u201d Eddins said.

LG is the third-largest smartphone vendor in the U.S. market with an 11 percent market share as of the first quarter of this year, and trails Apple Inc and Samsung, according to market researcher Counterpoint.  The firm has been renegotiating a licensing deal with Qualcomm after terminating the existing agreement in 2018 to seek better terms with the chipmaker. But the two companies have failed to reach a new deal and their interim license agreement will end this month.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  Qualcomm initiated the ITC case against Apple in July 2017, alleging that iPhones containing Intel INTC.O chips infringed six patents describing technology that helps smartphones perform well without draining the battery.  Qualcomm did not allege that Intel chips violate its patents, but that the way Apple implemented them in the iPhone does. It later dropped three of the six patents from the case.  Administrative law judge Thomas Pender, a now-retired member of the ITC tribunal that hears patent infringement cases, ruled in September that Apple infringed one of the patents, but cleared the company of infringing the other two.  Pender recommended the agency not grant Qualcomm the relief the San Diego, California-based chipmaker had sought, saying it was not in the U.S. interest.  The ITC said on Wednesday it would review whether the one patent was indeed infringed and also whether it was right to not grant Qualcomm relief. Pender\u2019s decision on the other two patents would not be reviewed, it said.

Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  Monday's trial is the second of two Qualcomm is pursuing against Apple at the ITC in which it is asking trade judges to ban the import of certain iPhone models containing Intel Corp INTC.O modem chips, which help phones connect to wireless data networks.  Import bans are rare, and Apple would have time potentially to change the design of its devices to avoid any patent infringement the courts may find. But Apple has come to rely more heavily on Intel for modem chips, with Qualcomm officials telling investors in July that its chips are not in the newest iPhone models.  At the first trial, which concluded in June, a U.S. staff attorney recommended that the judge find Apple infringed at least one Qualcomm battery-saving patent and that some Intel-chipped phones should be blocked from coming into the U.S. market. But the attorney said that models with so-called 5G, the next generation of wireless network, should be allowed to keep the market for 5G chips competitive.  The ITC staff acts as a third party in such trade cases. The staff lawyers\u2019 opinions are not binding, but judges often follow them. A decision in that case is expected later this month.  Monday\u2019s trial began concerns three patents. Two of them relate to how Intel\u2019s modem chips handle radio signals, and one relates to how Apple\u2019s processor chips put its iPhones to sleep.  While blocking iPhones is a drastic step, Apple would have several chances to appeal the decision, including to U.S. President Donald Trump. In 2013, then-President Barack Obama overturned a ban on some Apple iPads and iPhones that arose out of a dispute with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS.  The more consequential outcome of the ITC cases is for Qualcomm to test whether its patents are upheld under court scrutiny. It is suing Apple over many of the same patents in civil lawsuits that take longer to process, and the ITC case may give an early indication of how those civil lawsuits could ultimately play out.","228":"Feb 14 (Reuters) - Apple Inc said Thursday that it will resume selling older iPhone models in its stores in Germany after they were banned last year, but only with chips from Qualcomm Inc, which is in a global legal battle against the Cupertino company.

Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile chips, sued Apple in Germany alleging that some older iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models violated Qualcomm patents around so-called envelope tracking, a feature that helps mobile phones save battery power while sending and receiving wireless signals. The alleged patent violation stemmed not from Intel chips but yet another Apple supplier - Qorvo Inc - whose chip was only present in older phones with Intel modems.  The court sided with Qualcomm and banned sales of some iPhone models that used Intel modem chips, leading Apple to pull the devices from its 15 retail stories in Germany and its online store in the country.  The ban was a victory in Qualcomm\u2019s legal conflict with Apple.  The iPhone maker has alleged that Qualcomm engaged in illegal patent licensing practices to protect a monopoly on so-called modem chips, which connect mobile phones to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has in turn alleged that Apple has infringed its patents. A major case between the two goes to trial in the United States in April.  Apple began phasing in Intel\u2019s modem chips in 2016 after years of using chips exclusively from Qualcomm. In last year\u2019s iPhone models, Apple dropped Qualcomm\u2019s chips completely in favor of Intel\u2019s.  But Qualcomm has continued to supply Apple with chips for older models, and Apple on Thursday said it would use only those for German iPhone 7 and 8 models.  \u201cQualcomm is attempting to use injunctions against our products to try to get Apple to succumb to their extortionist demands,\u201d Apple said in a statement to Reuters.  Newer iPhones with Intel chips remain on sale in Germany.  \u201cIntel\u2019s modem products are not involved in this lawsuit and are not subject to this or any other injunction,\u201d Steven Rodgers, Intel\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Qualcomm is seen during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 27, 2018. REUTERS\/Yves Herman  The FTC took Qualcomm to trial in January and is awaiting a decision in federal court in California.  The Justice Department\u2019s filing asked Judge Lucy Koh of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California to hold a hearing on any possible remedies if she finds Qualcomm liable for antitrust violations and argued that \u201ca remedy should work as little injury as possible to other public policies,\u201d according to the filing.  The Justice Department said that any penalties Judge Koh might impose should not hamper the market for 5G, the next generation of mobile networks that are expected to be up to 100 times faster than current networks. The United States, China and Korea will roll out those networks this year and next, and Qualcomm makes so-called modem chips that allow smart phones and other devices to connect to those networks.  \u201c(T)here is a plausible prospect that an overly broad remedy in this case could reduce competition and innovation in markets for 5G technology and downstream applications that rely on that technology,\u201d the Justice Department wrote. \u201cSuch an outcome could exceed the appropriate scope of an equitable antitrust remedy. Moreover, it has the distinct potential to harm rather than help competition.\u201d  Qualcomm and the Justice Department did not immediately return a request for comment.  The FTC sued Qualcomm more than two years ago over allegations the company used anticompetitive patent licensing practices to maintain a monopoly on the market for premium modem chips.  The claims in the case mirrored similar antitrust claims made by iPhone maker Apple Inc. The two sides settled during opening arguments at the trial between Apple and Qualcomm.  The FTC\u2019s case was filed in the final days of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, with the lone Republican-appointed commissioner at the time formally dissenting against the action. Antitrust experts widely expected the case to be dismissed when President Donald Trump\u2019s appointees constituted a majority of the five-member commission.  But FTC Chairman Joseph J. Simons recused himself from voting on the Qualcomm case because of prior work he had done for the chip supplier while in private practice. Antitrust experts believe that left the commission\u2019s Democratic and Republican appointees deadlocked at 2-2 on the matter, which prevented the Republican-appointed commissioners from voting to dismiss the case and allowed it to proceed to trial.","230":"FILE PHOTO: A man works on a tent for NXP Semiconductors in preparation for the 2015 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) at Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 4, 2015.

NXP sold its 40 percent of Suzhou ASEN Semiconductors Co Ltd to Taiwanese venture partner Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc 2311.TW for $127 million, according to a stock exchange filing on Tuesday.  The sale could potentially help ease competition concerns by lowering NXP\u2019s exposure to the Chinese market as the country\u2019s commerce ministry considers Qualcomm\u2019s takeover bid.  Qualcomm has received approval from the other eight of nine required regulators to finalize its acquisition.  In January, NXP announced the end date for the transaction was extended to April 25, following multiple prior extensions.  A spokesman for NXP said the transaction was \u201cpart of the usual pruning of NXP\u2019s asset portfolio,\u201d and not related to the acquisition.  Qualcomm and the commerce ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment on Wednesday.  Chinese regulators are considering the deal at a time of heightened trade tension between China and the United States over a proposed U.S. plan to introduce tariffs on imports from China, including in high-tech sectors.  Last month, the U.S. government blocked the acquisition of Qualcomm by Singapore's Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O, citing national security concerns and worries about China gaining the upper-hand in fifth-generation (5G) mobile network technology.","231":"March 6 (Reuters) - A U.S. government security panel has identified potential security concerns that warrant a full investigation of Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd\u2019s $117 billion bid for chipmaker Qualcomm Inc, a senior U.S. Treasury official said in a letter to the companies on Monday.  Some of the concerns relate to risks associated with Broadcom's relationships with third party foreign entities, Aimen N. Mir, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investment Security said in the letter, dated March 5 and released by Qualcomm on Tuesday. (bit.ly\/2FtCesY)  He said the bulk of the concerns identified by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which on Sunday asked for time to examine the deal, were classified.  A source familiar with CFIUS\u2019 thinking told Reuters on Monday that if the deal was completed, the U.S. military was concerned that within 10 years, \u201cthere would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that\u2019s essentially Huawei.\u201d (Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru)","232":"(Reuters) - Microchip maker Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O cut its bid for Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O on Wednesday by 4 percent to $117 billion as it objected to Qualcomm\u2019s decision to raise its own bid for NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O to $44 billion.  Qualcomm responded that Broadcom had made \u201can inadequate offer even worse,\u201d setting up a showdown on March 6, when Qualcomm shareholders are scheduled to elect an 11-member board and decide whether to hand control to a slate of six nominees put forward by Broadcom.  A tie-up between Broadcom and Qualcomm would be the biggest technology acquisition ever. The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS use their market dominance to negotiate lower chip prices.  Broadcom said that Qualcomm\u2019s raised bid would amount to overpaying for NXP and cut its own bid as a result.  \u201cQualcomm\u2019s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders,\u201d Broadcom said in its statement on Wednesday.  The moves raise the chances that Qualcomm will buy NXP and lowered the chances of a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, CFRA Research analyst Scott Kessler wrote.  Broadcom also criticized Qualcomm on Wednesday for not liaising with it before raising its NXP bid, as proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc had recommended.  Qualcomm on Wednesday defended the value of the NXP deal, which it argued would expand Qualcomm\u2019s markets and offer cost savings, and said Broadcom had refused to engage in discussions on the value of Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm. The deal with Broadcom continued to face a \u201chighly uncertain path to regulatory approvals,\u201d Qualcomm added.  Qualcomm shares were trading down 0.5 percent at $63.53 on Wednesday afternoon in New York, while Broadcom shares were up 1.2 percent at $252.69.  Qualcomm raised its offer for NXP from $110 to $127.50 per share in cash on Tuesday.  In exchange, it received binding agreements from nine NXP stockholders that collectively own more than 28 percent of NXP\u2019s outstanding shares to support the deal. These include hedge funds Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd and Soroban Capital Partners LP, which had pushed for a higher price.  Broadcom\u2019s latest $82 per share cash-and-stock offer for Qualcomm was contingent on it buying NXP at its earlier offered price of $110 per share. Broadcom said on Wednesday that if the NXP deal goes ahead at $127.50, it will reduce the cash portion of its bid for Qualcomm by $3 per share.  Qualcomm is contractually obligated to complete the NXP deal, so that acquisition could fall apart only if too few NXP shareholders support the tender offer or if China\u2019s MOFCOM, the only relevant regulator that has yet to approve the deal, blocks it.  Under the new terms agreed with NXP\u2019s board, the deal with Qualcomm is contingent on 70 percent of NXP\u2019s shares being tendered, instead of the 80 percent threshold required in the earlier agreement signed in October 2016. Once this threshold is reached, Qualcomm can take over the entire company through a \u201csecond-step\u201d transaction mechanism.  NXP shares were trading at $125.70 on Wednesday, close to the new deal price, indicating that most investors think the acquisition will go through.  Broadcom said on Wednesday other conditions of the proposed merger agreement remained unchanged, including an $8 billion breakup fee to be paid to Qualcomm should regulators thwart the deal.","233":"FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017.

REUTERS\/Stringer  The figure is the most recent data point the company has released to prove it can diversify its revenue sources after its $44 billion deal to buy Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors fell apart last month.  The sales of so-called \u201cinternet of things,\u201d or IoT, chips is about one fifth of the $5 billion in revenue that Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said the San Diego chipmaker believes it will make outside the mobile phone market.  Qualcomm dominates the market for processor chips for phones as well as modem chips that let phones connect to wireless data networks, counting firms like Samsung Electronics Co and Apple Inc as major customers.  The sales of smart phones has flattened in recent years though and are growing slowly. To respond to that broader trend, Qualcomm had sought to purchase NXP, a dominant supplier to the automotive market, where car makers are adding more chips to vehicles each year. That deal fell apart last month after failing to secure approval from Chinese regulators.  Now, Mollenkopf is under pressure from investors to show he can expand Qualcomm\u2019s sales without NXP\u2019s help.  While Qualcomm had disclosed that it expected $5 billion in non-mobile chip sales this year, up from $3 billion last year, it had not given any information about the composition of that $5 billion until Thursday. The rest of the $5 billion beyond IoT chips comes from networking chips, Qualcomm\u2019s own automotive chips and a few other areas.  Qualcomm\u2019s chips for the IoT market typically power small, battery-powered devices that are becoming more common.  In a statement released ahead of a planned briefing with analysts on its progress, Qualcomm said its chips are now in more than 200 kinds of so-called wearable devices and 1,300 different wireless headsets, earbuds and wireless speakers.  The company also said it expects revenue growth from chips for wireless, internet-connected cameras to increase 120 percent this year versus last year, though it did not give an absolute dollar figure.","235":"Feb 12 (Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd:  * BROADCOM AND FINANCING SOURCES SIGN BINDING FINANCING COMMITMENTS TO FUND CASH COMPONENT OF QUALCOMM ACQUISITION  * BROADCOM LTD - SILVER LAKE JOINED BY KKR AND CVC IN $6 BILLION CONVERTIBLE NOTES FINANCING TO FUND QUALCOMM TRANSACTION  * BROADCOM LTD - SIGNED COMMITTED FINANCING AGREEMENTS TO FUND ITS PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF QUALCOMM INC  * BROADCOM LTD - A GROUP OF 12 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE AGREED TO PROVIDE UP TO $100 BILLION OF COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES  * BROADCOM LTD - THE $100 BILLION COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES INCLUDE A $5 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND BRIDGE FINANCING  * BROADCOM -AS RESULT FINANCING,HAS SUFFICIENT COMMITTED FINANCING TO FUND $60\/SHARE CASH COMPONENT OF $82\/SHARE OFFER TO ACQUIRE ALL SHARES OF QUALCOMM  * BROADCOM- INVESTMENT FUNDS AFFILIATED WITH SILVER LAKE, KKR, CVC TO GIVE $6 BILLION CONVERTIBLE NOTE FINANCING TO FUND DEAL, POST-CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","236":"FILE PHOTO: The company logo and trading information for BlackRock is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 30, 2017.

In November, Qualcomm\u2019s Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf made comments about the supplier\u2019s efforts to resolve the dispute.  Qualcomm on Tuesday said Cook miscast Mollenkopf\u2019s remarks, which did not mention a settlement and which Qualcomm maintains are accurate.  The war of words is unlikely to play a major role in the outcome of the legal fight between the two firms. But it signals the high stakes and deeply entrenched positions of each side, with Apple arguing in court that Qualcomm charges an unfair \u201ctax\u201d on its phones while Qualcomm fights to protect a patent licensing model it argues has helped bring connectivity to billions of new users through wireless networks.  In a television interview on CNBC earlier on Tuesday, Cook responded to a question from host Jim Cramer about whether Apple would settle with Qualcomm after Qualcomm had announced legal victories against Apple in patent cases in China and Germany.  \u201cLook, the truth is, we haven\u2019t been in any settlement discussions with them since the third calendar quarter of last year. That is the truth. So I\u2019m not sure where that thinking is coming from,\u201d Cook said.  Cook\u2019s comments contrasted with those Mollenkopf made in November on CNBC.  \u201cWe do talk as companies, and I think what you\u2019re seeing, really, are activities consistent, really, with the fourth quarter of the game, and not the first quarter,\u201d Mollenkopf told CNBC then. \u201cWe always talk about \u2013 and I\u2019ve been very consistent - that this second half of and into, is when we\u2019re really on the doorstep of finding a resolution.\u201d  In a statement, a Qualcomm spokesperson said the company stands by Mollenkopf\u2019s remarks.  \u201cWe have been consistent for the last 18 months in making clear that we have, at various times, been in discussions with Apple about a possible resolution to our licensing dispute,\u201d a Qualcomm spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe have also stated clearly on several occasions that we believe it will be resolved, one way or the other, in the near future, either through a settlement or court decisions.\u201d  The primary case in Apple and Qualcomm\u2019s legal battle goes to trial in April.  Apple has accused Qualcomm of engaging in illegal patent licensing practices to preserve a dominant market position in so-called modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has argued that its practices followed decades-long tech industry norms and that Apple has not fairly compensated it for its intellectual property.

FILE PHOTO: Broadcom Limited company logo is pictured on an office building in Rancho Bernardo, California May 12, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  CFIUS, an opaque inter-agency panel, has been in touch with at least one of the companies in the proposed merger, one source said, and met last month to discuss the potential merger of the two big semiconductor companies, according to two sources familiar with the matter.  Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday to have the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, officially review the proposed transaction before a key shareholder vote expected on March 6, according to a letter seen by Reuters.  The pre-deal discussions by CFIUS -- which are extremely rare -- suggest Broadcom\u2019s plans to move its headquarters to the United States before it completes its proposed purchase of Qualcomm may not be enough to sidestep a national security review that could threaten the deal.  Part of CFIUS\u2019 current concern, which is echoed in Cornyn\u2019s letter, could lie in the fact that Broadcom has failed to strike a deal with Qualcomm and has resorted to what is essentially a hostile takeover by putting forward a slate of six Broadcom nominees for Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board.  If the six are elected on March 6, the vote would give control of Qualcomm to Broadcom\u2019s nominees. That would happen before a CFIUS review or antitrust review is complete.  \u201cI urge CFIUS to promptly review Broadcom\u2019s proposed acquisition of control of Qualcomm\u2019s board, and to act prior to the March 6 Qualcomm meeting to address any national security concerns that may be identified,\u201d Cornyn wrote to Secretary Mnuchin, according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.  A spokesman for CFIUS declined to comment. Representatives for Cornyn did not respond to requests for comment.  Broadcom said in a statement Tuesday that it plans to move from Singapore to the United States, following receipt of approvals expected by May 6, and once again be a U.S. corporation.  \u201cWe remain confident in our ability to complete a transaction with Qualcomm within approximately 12 months following the signing of a definitive agreement,\u201d Broadcom said.  A CFIUS review in itself does not mean a deal will be halted. CFIUS, under former President Barack Obama and current President Donald Trump, has soured on high tech deals, particularly involving semiconductors, or involving sensitive information about American citizens.  Microprocessor expert Linley Gwennap, of the Linley Group, said that Qualcomm had world-leading chips in several areas.  \u201cQualcomm is a crown jewel of the American semiconductor industry,\u201d he said. \u201cI would think that CFIUS would be very protective of that. ... Singapore is nominally a friendly country but it still seems dangerous for that level of technology to go overseas.\u201d  Broadcom, which is based in Singapore, struggled to win CFIUS approval to buy Brocade Communications Systems late last year. In the end, that approval came just weeks after Broadcom CEO Hock Tan announced in an Oval Office ceremony with Trump that Broadcom would return its headquarters to the United States.  Lawyers who take deals to CFIUS and know how the panel thinks said that it was unusual, if not unprecedented, for a company to move to the United States to avoid CFIUS scrutiny. But they also said that the strategy could work.  \u201cBroadcom could very well establish its position as a U.S. person,\u201d one expert said privately to protect business relationships. \u201cWould CFIUS want to look at it? They would want to be comfortable that Broadcom is actually a U.S. person within the meaning of the statute.\u201d  Others cautioned that CFIUS could also look at the make-up of Broadcom\u2019s board and who the major shareholders are as a way to determine if control of the company resides outside the United States.","239":"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump's dramatic intervention in Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd's AVGO.O $117 billion hostile bid for U.S. semiconductor peer Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O is the latest reminder to investment bankers not to take lucrative fees on transformative mergers for granted under his administration.

Broadcom has disclosed its financial advisers as Moelis & Co M.S, Citigroup C.N, Morgan Stanley MS.N, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Bank of America Corp BAML.N, Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N. They stood to receive an estimated $135 million if the deal had gone ahead, according to Freeman Consulting Services.  This is not the first time Trump's administration has put investment banking fees in jeopardy. The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop AT&T Inc T.N, from buying HBO and CNN owner Time Warner Inc TWX.N for $85 billion, citing antitrust concerns.  If that deal closes, AT&T's adviser, Perella Weinberg Partners, will receive an estimated $80 million, Freeman said, while Time Warner's advisers, Allen & Co, Citigroup Inc C.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N, will receive $140 million, according to regulatory filings.  To be sure, the Trump administration\u2019s overall track record is not hostile to mergers. Deal activity continues to be robust, with U.S. merger and acquisition volumes reaching $389 billion so far this year, compared with $236.5 billion in the same period a year ago, as companies have been emboldened by U.S. tax reform to pursue big deals.  What is more, banks typically do receive some small portion of the full fees if deals fall through. In the case of Broadcom, the banks could now receive an estimated $20 million, according to Freeman.  However, the high-profile dealmaking casualties illustrate how Trump\u2019s pro-business rhetoric has not always translated into smooth sailing for the regulatory approval of deals.  Investment bankers' nerves are about to be tested further, as more transformative deals make their way through the regulatory review process. Walt Disney Co's DIS.N $52.4 billion acquisition of assets from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O, CVS Health Corp's CVS.N $69 billion deal to buy health insurer Aetna Inc AET.N and U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp's CI.N $52 billion agreement to buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O will be subjected to intense regulatory scrutiny later this year.","240":"March 16 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc\u2019s board of directors was meeting on Friday to discuss former chairman Paul Jacobs leaving its board after he informed the U.S. semiconductor company he was exploring ways to acquire it, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  (Reuters) - InterDigital Wireless Inc said on Monday that it can license its 5G network technology to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd despite the threat of a U.S. ban on selling chips and software to the Chinese telecommunications firm, and patent attorneys said Qualcomm Inc likely also can do so.  InterDigital and Qualcomm are the two major American holders of patents for wireless networking technology, including the 5G networks rolling out this year in China. Last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order restricting the ability of U.S. firms to sell technology to Huawei, though officials on Monday eased some of those restrictions for 90 days.  InterDigital, which generates revenue by developing wireless technologies and then licensing out the patents, said it believes it can continue its efforts to strike a 5G deal with Huawei because export control laws do not cover patents, which are public records and therefore not confidential technology.  \u201cThe addition of Huawei to the Entity List does not prevent InterDigital from entering into a patent license agreement with Huawei, because our patents cover technologies that are publicly available and therefore outside the scope of U.S. export control laws,\u201d InterDigital spokesman Patrick Van de Wille told Reuters in a statement.  Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment. But trade attorneys said the situation is likely the same for the San Diego-based company. Qualcomm also sells chips to Huawei, but only for Huawei\u2019s lower-priced handset. It generates most of its profits from patent licenses.  \u201cIf you\u2019re giving Huawei rights to your patents, all that means in effect is that you\u2019re not going to sue them,\u201d said Erick Robinson, a partner with Dunlap Bennett & Ludwig who formerly worked as a patent attorney for Qualcomm in China. \u201cYou\u2019re not passing on any information whatsoever.\u201d  Huawei, the world\u2019s third-largest smartphone provider and also a major provider of telecommunications gear, is a big customer for both InterDigital and Qualcomm. The Chinese tech firm accounted for 14% of InterDigital\u2019s $533 million in revenue in 2017, the most recent year for which figures are available.  Both American companies are in the middle of license disputes with Huawei over 5G technology. Huawei sued InterDigital in China in January, alleging the Wilmington, Delaware-based company was seeking to charge too much for its patents, a claim InterDigital disputes.  Qualcomm has had a patent deal with Huawei since 2014, but Huawei stopped paying in 2017.

FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday halted microchip maker Broadcom Ltd's AVGO.O $117 billion takeover of Qualcomm over concerns it would give China the upper hand in the next generation of mobile communications, forcing the Singapore-based firm to drop its bid.  The move illustrated the awkward position of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego. In the United States, it has government and defense contracts and is seen as a \"trusted\" supplier. In China, it has its most lucrative market, thanks to patent licensing fees it receives there from smartphone vendors including Apple Inc AAPL.O, Samsung 005930.KS and Xiaomi.  (GRAPHIC: Broadcom, Qualcomm global footprint - tmsnrt.rs\/2FIS93)  On top of that, China, the United States and Europe are racing to develop the next generation of wireless data network, called 5G, for mobile phones and increasingly connected devices. Whoever controls the technology will gain a potential strategic advantage, and the U.S. government does not want to have to rely on Chinese-made gear.  The result is a delicate balancing act to navigate trade disputes and political tensions between Beijing and Washington that could irk policymakers and regulators on both sides, hurting business and deals.  \u201cWe see ourselves as part of the China semiconductor system,\u201d Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm President told Reuters at a Beijing event in January. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that 5G is important to the United States of America. It\u2019s important for China.\u201d  Qualcomm is still waiting for Chinese approval of its proposed $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O and trying to mend its relationship with Chinese customers after paying a fine of nearly $1 billion for anti-competitive practices in 2015.  The company is helping Chinese firms ZTE and China Mobile develop 5G technology and is involved in China\u2019s 5G standard development trials. It has similar partnerships in the U.S. and Europe.  GAINING AN ADVANTAGE  The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets acquisitions of U.S. corporations by foreign companies, said the Broadcom takeover risked weakening Qualcomm, which would boost China in the 5G race.  A Broadcom takeover could see the company cut research and development spending by Qualcomm or sell strategically important parts of the company to other buyers, including those in China, officials and analysts said.  As such concerns emerged, Broadcom immediately jumped into action, pledging to invest in Qualcomm\u2019s 5G technology and accelerate its move to the United States. But the plan didn\u2019t go down well with CFIUS.  The clash marked a sharp fall from grace for Broadcom, whose chief executive, Hock Tan, Trump welcomed to the White House last year to announce a plan to move its headquarters to the United States. At the time, Trump called it \u201cone of the really great, great companies.\u201d  Led by Tan, a Harvard-educated Malaysian entrepreneur, Broadcom grew largely through acquisitions. Tan is an aggressive dealmaker and built the $100 billion chip giant up from a business worth just $3.5 billion in 2009.  Until the Qualcomm bid, its biggest deal had been the $37 billion acquisition of Irvine, California-based Broadcom, where the company, called Avago Technologies at the time, got its current name.  COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP  Qualcomm executives acknowledge the tricky relationship the firm has in China, especially with local companies like Huawei, which is spearheading China\u2019s 5G push.  \u201cOur relationship with Huawei is complex; I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a good word for it,\u201d Amon said in Beijing in January, adding that the company was a big supplier to Huawei while also being a competitor with Huawei\u2019s semiconductor business.  Although Huawei is in a strong position to supply 5G network equipment to carriers in many large markets - with the notable exception of the United States - it still has to license some technologies from Qualcomm, which owns more 5G patents than any other company in the world.  Keeping Chinese relationships on track is key for Qualcomm as domestic smartphone makers like Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi gain prominence and as broader U.S.-China trade tensions rise.  Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors, two people who had discussed the issue with the Trump administration told Reuters.  \u201cI would imagine relationships that we have in China, and probably the symbiosis of that relationship, it will play a very strong role with the (Chinese) regulators\u2019 view of the future of Qualcomm,\u201d Amon said in January.  And the Broadcom takeover case highlights a growing risk for U.S. companies in China.  \u201cIt\u2019s an unenviable position because they are pretty dependent on China,\u201d said Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China and North Asia at risk consultancy Control Risks, referring to Qualcomm.  \u201cThey are an extreme case but as more and more sectors become effectively considered \u2018strategic\u2019 from a comprehensive national security perspective, more and more companies are facing this kind of squeeze between the U.S. and China.\u201d  (GRAPHIC: Global tech M&A - tmsnrt.rs\/2zjPc9A)","244":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Wednesday detailed the first significant sales gains from a new category of chip it is selling to mobile phone makers, but also disclosed that an antitrust investigation has started around those chips.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  The European Union is investigating whether Qualcomm engaged in anti-competitive behavior by leveraging its market position in 5G modem chips in the radio frequency chip market, the San Diego company said on Wednesday in a regulatory filing.  The disclosure comes after the company spent years battling regulators - and paid billions of dollars in fines - over allegations that it engaged in anticompetitive patent licensing practices. Qualcomm last year lost a case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and remains locked in an appeal.  Qualcomm supplies \u201cmodem\u201d chips, also sometimes called baseband processors, that connect mobile phones to wireless data networks.  But the company is also expanding into a related field called radio frequency front-end chips, which have become more complex in phones that use 5G networks.  Qualcomm has been trying to persuade phone makers to buy its radio frequency chips, together with its own modem chips, rather than selecting parts from separate vendors and integrating them.  Other major suppliers of radio frequency chips are Broadcom Inc, Skyworks Solutions Inc and Qorvo Inc.  Qualcomm executives said on Wednesday that revenue from the radio frequency market contributed to a sales forecast that beat analyst expectations.  In Wednesday\u2019s filing, Qualcomm said it was in the process of responding to a probe by the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive branch, after it served a request for information with the company on Dec. 3.  Qualcomm said the commission could impose a fine of up to 10% of its annual revenue if a violation were found.  Qualcomm was fined 242 million euros by the European Commission in July last year for blocking a rival from the market about a decade ago, its second EU antitrust penalty. The Commission had also fined Qualcomm 997 million euros during 2018 for paying iPhone maker Apple to use only its chips, a tactic aimed at thwarting rivals including Intel Corp .  Qualcomm has won radio frequency chip contracts with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and LG Electronics Inc, among others.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday announced a new range of Wi-Fi chips designed to work with Wi-Fi 6, the newest version of the technology and one that Qualcomm hopes will help boost sales of its separate 5G chips.  Qualcomm is the biggest supplier of mobile phone chips but has been looking to expand beyond that as the global phone market has stagnated in recent years.  The San Diego-based tech company has been pushing instead into chips for automobiles, headphones, laptops and other devices. Its Wi-Fi chips are found in devices such as the \u201cmesh\u201d Wi-Fi routers made by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and designed to help provide better coverage over an entire household.  Separately, Qualcomm is also working with phonemakers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to bring chips for 5G, the next generation of wireless data networks, to phones.  With the new series of Wi-Fi chips, Qualcomm is hoping its two lines of business will one day come together. Both Wi-Fi 6, a new standard expected to fully roll out by 2022, and 5G technology differ from their predecessors in that they are designed to work more closely together, allowing Wi-Fi routers to more seamlessly hand off connections with mobile phones and other devices that use both kinds of networks.  Moreover, unlike previous 4G technology where the networks were primarily owned by telecommunications companies, 5G technology will allow businesses to build their own private 5G networks to better connect large campuses, factories and other locations that remain difficult to blanket with Wi-Fi.  Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm\u2019s president and chief of its chip division, said the company hopes to one day sell chips for both technologies to the makers of business networking gear.  \u201cYou should expect in the future to see us talking about integrated platforms that have both millimeter-wave and Wi-Fi 6,\u201d Amon told Reuters in an interview.","252":"BEIJING\/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China is yet to approve U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc's QCOM.O proposed $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NXPI.O, three people close to the talks said, dismissing an earlier media report that said Beijing had already greenlit the deal.  Chinese clearance would remove a long-running roadblock to the deal that has become entangled with broader trade tensions between the United States and China. The acquisition has already got a nod from eight of the nine required global regulators, with China being the only hold-out.  Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Friday morning that China had given its go-ahead to the deal, citing people with knowledge of the matter, driving up shares of the U.S. firm in extended trade.  But Reuters sources, who are close to the Qualcomm-NXP deal, said they were not aware of any Chinese approval. One of them said planned U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods expected to be unveiled later in the day could impact the process.  Qualcomm did not have an immediate comment on Friday, while NXP did not respond to a request for comment.  China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation, the regulator which reviews merger deals, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.  Qualcomm met with regulators in Beijing last month in a bid to secure a clearance, but sources at the time said an approval would depend on the progress of broader bilateral talks and the U.S. government lifting a crippling supplier ban on telecoms equipment maker ZTE Corp 000063.SZ0763.HK.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Washington and Beijing have struck a deal to help ZTE back into business. However, trade talks remain in the balance with U.S. President Donald Trump expected to unveil \u201cpretty significant\u201d tariffs on Chinese goods on Friday.  Analysts said a Chinese approval would be significant as it would remove the last major barrier to the NXP deal, which is seen as key for Qualcomm to diversify its business and make a push into new areas like smart cars.  The U.S. chipmaker on Friday extended its cash tender offer to buy all shares of NXP by a week.  The offer is now scheduled to expire on June 22, the latest in a series of extensions since Qualcomm initially announced its bid for the Dutch semiconductor company in October 2016.","253":"Sept 6 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc said on Friday it will put fifth-generation, or 5G, technology into chips powering mid-priced mobile phones starting next year, expanding use of chips now found almost exclusively in pricey phones such as Samsung\u2019s $1,299 Galaxy S10 5G model.  Qualcomm is already supplying phone makers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd with chips for 5G wireless data networks, which are expected to be faster than current 4G and LTE networks. But those chips have typically been from the San Diego chip suppliers\u2019 most expensive line, its Snapdragon 8 series.  Qualcomm said in remarks prepared for the IFA tech fair in Berlin that it plans to add 5G capabilities to its lower-cost Snapdragon 6 and 7 series devices, which could make 5G phones available at lower prices than the current models, mostly flagship devices priced at a premium. Qualcomm\u2019s 6 and 7 series Snapdragon chips are found in devices from Lenovo Group Ltd\u2019s Motorola, Xiaomi Corp, Oppo and Vivo that retail in the $300 range.  Analysts believe the new 5G networks will spur many consumers to upgrade their phones after years of market stagnation. Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, was early to the market with 5G modem chips to connect phones to networks but faces intense competition.  Huawei Technologies Co Ltd has plans for a new high-end smart phone, the Mate 30, which will feature 5G capabilities but will use a Kirin 990 chip developed by Huawei\u2019s on subsidiary HiSilicon. That phone\u2019s prospects are colored by whether it can use Alphabet Inc\u2019s official Android operating system in light of Huawei\u2019s blacklisting by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.  Taiwan-based MediaTek Inc earlier this year has also announced a 5G smartphone chip.  Qualcomm is hoping that broad compatibility with telecom carrier networks will help its chips compete.  Qualcomm\u2019s chip handles the two variants of 5G networks, so-called sub-6 and millimeter-wave bands. That means that phones using its chip will work on any carrier\u2019s 5G networks, especially in the United States.  Chips such as MediaTek\u2019s are only capable of handling the sub-6 bands, which keeps the cost and complexity of the chips and phone designs down. However, it means the phones cannot take full advantage of networks from U.S. carriers such as Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc that use millimeter wave technology.  Qualcomm\u2019s approach appears to be gaining it some market share. Samsung on Thursday said that it would use a Qualcomm chip in its Galaxy A90 handset in Europe, a device that previously used Samsung\u2019s own processor chips.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The San Diego chipmaker filed a complaint against Apple nearly a year ago, asking the commission to ban the import of iPhones containing rival chipmaker Intel Corp's INTC.O so-called modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data networks.  At a trial in Washington that started on Friday, the ITC staff said Apple violated one of Qualcomm\u2019s patents around battery-saving technology.  The ITC staff acts as a third party in such trade cases. The staff lawyers\u2019 opinions are not binding, but judges often follow them.  In previous filings in the ITC case, Apple has argued that Qualcomm\u2019s patents are invalid and that, regardless, the judge should not ban Intel-based iPhones because it would give Qualcomm a monopoly on modems in the United States and drive Intel out of the modem business.  \u201cQualcomm is selectively asserting its patents to target only Apple products containing Intel chipsets \u2014 even though its patent infringement allegations would apply equally to Apple products containing Qualcomm chipsets \u2014 in an attempt to use the ITC as another mechanism for perpetuating its ill-gotten monopoly position,\u201d Apple wrote.  The ITC case is the first to go to trial out of more than a dozen legal fights between Apple and Qualcomm over patents, licensing practices and contracts between the two. A decision is expected by January.  If the ITC judge decides to ban some iPhone imports, Qualcomm could use that to try to persuade Apple to settle or drop several of the other patent and contract cases, legal experts have said.  Apple has argued that some of Qualcomm\u2019s practices are illegal, and the chipmaker has paid billions of dollars in fines from antitrust regulators in several countries, though it is still appealing some of those rulings.  Qualcomm says its practices are legal and were accepted by customers for many years as the smartphone industry boomed, but it has made some changes to its licensing model of taking a cut of the selling price of a device in a bid to ease tensions with customers and regulators.","255":"WASHINGTON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Monday that President Donald Trump put the issue of U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc\u2019s now abandoned acquisition of Dutch peer NXP Semiconductors NV on the table for talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The meeting comes after Broadcom raised its cash-and-stock offer last week from $70 to $82 per share, and made other concessions, including offering to pay Qualcomm an $8 billion breakup fee should antitrust regulators block the deal.  Qualcomm said last Thursday that Broadcom\u2019s new offer still undervalues it and falls well short of the firm commitments on regulatory issues it expected. However, it offered to meet Broadcom to see if it can address what it called \u201cserious deficiencies in value and certainty in its proposal.\u201d  As part of its bid to take over Qualcomm, Broadcom has also launched a campaign with Qualcomm shareholders to replace Qualcomm\u2019s board. Both companies are due to meet proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis before their Feb. 14 meeting to argue why Qualcomm shareholders should back them in a vote scheduled for March 6.  Broadcom had requested last week to meet over the weekend, but has now agreed to meet on Wednesday instead, the sources said on Sunday, asking not to be identified because the meeting\u2019s details are not public.  Qualcomm and Broadcom did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices.  Singapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily licenses its technology for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  Broadcom\u2019s antitrust counsel, Daniel Wall of Latham & Watkins LLP, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week that Broadcom was willing to sell two Qualcomm businesses to resolve any antitrust problems. These are its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones.  Qualcomm responded on Thursday that unless Broadcom will agree to do whatever is necessary to ensure the deal closes, a commitment to divestitures without restrictions often referred to as \u201chell or high water\u201d, it would have to be extremely clear and specific about what actions it would refuse to take.  Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told Reuters in an interview last week that Broadcom decided not to offer hell-or-high-water provisions to Qualcomm because it does not view them as a very well defined legal standard.","259":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China\u2019s market regulator said it still hoped to find a solution to antitrust concerns that doomed Qualcomm Inc\u2019s $44 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors, after finding that proposals to address the issue had fallen short.

China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said in a statement on Friday that proposals put forth by the firms to resolve Chinese antitrust concerns were insufficient, but it hoped to continue communicating with Qualcomm.  The Chinese move likely comes too late for a resurrection of the deal, which had become embroiled in a political spat between Washington and Beijing. With the deal called off, the two companies have announced major share buybacks and Qualcomm has already paid NXP a $2 billion break fee.  \u201cComing a day after the deadline, my guess is the SAMR statement is meant to counter perceptions the deal approval process was politicized, not to revive it,\u201d said Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China and North Asia at consultancy Control Risks.  \u201cOf course, this conflicts with the view among many people following the deal that the U.S.-China situation had become the main obstacle, not the competition implications.\u201d  The collapse of the deal could aggravate tensions between Washington and Beijing amid a whipsawing trade standoff that has chilled relations between the world\u2019s top two economies.  Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest smartphone-chip maker, had said on Wednesday it would drop the bid for NXP, unless a last minute reprieve from China was received. There was no word from SAMR, the antitrust regulator reviewing the deal, as the deadline for the deal to expire passed.  The Chinese regulator said on Friday that it was open to continuing negotiations over approving the deal. It added its current review period would expire on Aug. 15, with an extended review deadline of Oct. 14.  \u201cThe results of our evaluation showed that Qualcomm\u2019s latest plan could not resolve competition issues,\u201d the regulator said, adding it had notified the chipmaker of this decision.  \u201cWe hope to continue to communicate with Qualcomm and that we can find a suitable solution to resolve the issues within the review period.\u201d  When asked for a comment on SAMR\u2019s statement, a Qualcomm spokeswoman pointed to the announcement of the deal\u2019s termination. NXP could not be immediately reached for comment.  CAUGHT UP IN TRADE WAR?  China\u2019s commerce ministry said on Thursday the Qualcomm case was about anti-monopoly issues, and not related to China-U.S. trade frictions.  Qualcomm, however, viewed it differently.  Qualcomm Chief Executive Steven Mollenkopf told CNBC in an interview on Thursday the firm had been caught up in a trade war, while U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said it was disappointing and called for U.S. firms to be treated fairly.  The Chinese market regulator added in its statement that the country would treat all companies fairly and that China was open to foreign firms investing and doing business in the country.  Gilholm of Control Risks said the big question for U.S. firms and politicians would be whether the issue would hit other deals involving American firms.  \u201cThe United States will certainly view it as political, no question about that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know yet is if it\u2019s a one-off or not.

The licensing business drove the adjusted profit forecast with a midpoint of 85 cents per share, also above analyst expectations of 83 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data. The return of Apple sales also provides Qualcomm a seasonal boost in its fiscal first quarter that ends in December, when Apple traditionally sells its biggest number of devices and therefore pays the most royalties.  On the chip side, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, told Reuters in an interview that the company has won deals to supply 230 device designs with 5G chips, up from 150 a quarter ago.  \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to see strength in the licensing business, particularly after we\u2019ve added in the deal we signed this year with Apple, and we\u2019re on the front end of the 5G transition, which will impact our product business,\u201d Mollenkopf said. \u201cWe\u2019re closer to that and we\u2019re really seeing the signs that we should be confident.\u201d  The news sent shares up nearly 5.1% to $89.00 in after-hours trading.  The company has resolved license disputes with major customers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Apple.  It helps that most of Qualcomm\u2019s customers are actually paying,\u201d Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said.  But Qaulcomm remains in a license dispute with Huawei. \u201cAlthough negotiations continue, we have not reached a final agreement with Huawei,\u201d Qualcomm said on Wednesday.  Qualcomm said it expects between 1.75 billion and 1.85 billion smart devices with modem chips, including 175 million to 225 million 5G handsets, to be sold in 2020. Because Qualcomm collects license fees on devices that use cellular connections to wireless data networks, a greater number of devices sold often results in higher revenue and profits.  The results come a week after Apple calmed Wall Street nerves with improved sales in China, the world's largest smartphone market, and follow strong earnings from chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O last month.  Qualcomm said that for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 29, revenue in its licensing segment was $1.16 billion, beating estimates of $1.10 billion, according to data from FactSet.  Excluding items, the company earned 78 cents per share, topping analysts\u2019 average estimate of 71 cents.  Revenue in the fourth-quarter fell about 17% to $4.81 billion, but beat analysts\u2019 estimates of $4.70 billion.","261":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday unveiled a new chip for speeding up artificial intelligence work, aiming to diversify beyond its stronghold in mobile phone chips and into a fast-growing market now dominated by Nvidia Corp and Intel Corp.  FILE PHOTO: Qualcomm and 5G logos are seen at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2019. REUTERS\/Sergio Perez  At an event in San Francisco, Qualcomm said it plans to begin testing its new Cloud AI 100 chip with partners such as Microsoft Corp later this year, with mass production likely to begin in 2020.  Qualcomm\u2019s new chip is designed for what artificial intelligence researchers call \u201cinference\u201d - the process of using an AI algorithm that has been \u201ctrained\u201d with massive amounts of data in order to, for example, translate audio into text-based requests.  Analysts believe chips for speeding up inference will be the largest part of the AI chip market.  Nvidia has released special chips for the task and Intel is working with Facebook Inc on one that will be released later this year. Cloud computing vendors such as Amazon.com\u2019s Amazon Web Services and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Cloud unit are also making their own inference chips.  All that activity means Qualcomm is entering a crowded field behind its rivals.  But Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm\u2019s president and the chief of its chip division, said the San Diego company is taking a different approach by aiming to serve the smaller, simpler data centers that are proliferating around the world so that consumers can benefit from faster response times for their internet-connected apps.  In order to serve those smaller \u201cedge\u201d data sites, Qualcomm is focusing on AI chips that consume small amounts of electricity and generate little heat - a specialty it developed when making chips for mobile phones, which run on small batteries and live in pockets.  Rivals such as Intel and Nvidia make more powerful chips that dominate in centralized data centers that suck up electricity and need complex cooling systems.  \u201cYou can\u2019t rely on big [data center] buildings with air conditioning,\u201d Amon told reporters at the San Francisco event. \u201cThat\u2019s our bet - performance per watt leadership.\u201d  Qualcomm tried before to parlay its mobile chip expertise into data center sales, when it aimed to compete directly with Intel\u2019s core business by selling CPU chips based on mobile phone chip technology. That effort has largely been wound down as a cost-cutting measure.  \u201cI think this is a good start for Qualcomm, but they have a lot to prove in the higher performance accelerator space,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy.","262":"(Reuters) - Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd withdrew its $117 billion bid to acquire Qualcomm Inc on Wednesday, two days after U.S. President Donald Trump blocked the attempt, citing national security concerns.  A sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The company said it has also withdrawn its slate of independent director nominees for Qualcomm\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.  Broadcom expects to continue with its plan to redomicile to the United States.  Here are the important developments that have taken place since Broadcom made its first bid to buy Qualcomm:  March 13  - A dozen banks that signed on to provide a record $100 billion bridge loan to back Broadcom\u2019s planned $117 billion takeover of Qualcomm will earn starkly less than planned for extending credit to the chipmaker after President Trump blocked the deal over national security concerns.  - Senator Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate, praised Trump\u2019s decision, calling China\u2019s trade practices \u201crapacious.\u201d  - Broadcom, led by dynamic Chief Executive Hock Tan, is unlikely to put the brakes on an acquisition spree after its $117 billion bid for Qualcomm Inc was blocked by President Trump on national security grounds.  That was the immediate reaction from Wall Street\u2019s tech sector analysts to Trump\u2019s surprise intervention to block what would have been the biggest ever tech merger.  March 12  - President Trump signed an order to halt the deal on concerns that a takeover of Qualcomm by the Singapore-based company would erode the United States\u2019 lead in mobile technology and give China the upper hand.  - Broadcom violated an order from a national security panel in a bid to push for a merger with Qualcomm, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a letter.  The letter said that Broadcom \u201ctook a series of actions in violation\u201d of a previous order from Treasury.  - Broadcom said it expects to redomicile to the United States by April 3.  March 9  - Microchip maker Intel Corp responded to a news report that it is considering a possible bid for Broadcom by saying that it is focused on integrating previous acquisitions, raising doubt over the idea.  The Wall Street Journal reported that Intel\u2019s competitive concern about Broadcom\u2019s attempt to buy Qualcomm had led it to consider a range of acquisitions in response, including a bid for Broadcom.  - A U.S. national security panel ordered Broadcom to provide it with five business days\u2019 notice before taking any action toward redomiciling to the United States, a regulatory filing revealed.  The previously undisclosed requirement shows that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies for potential national security risks, is aware that its jurisdiction could be contested if Broadcom redomiciles to the United States.  - Broadcom promised not to sell critical national security assets to foreign buyers if its deal for Qualcomm is approved, another effort by the firm to appease U.S. security concerns.  Separately, Qualcomm said it discontinued the role of executive chairman and named a new non-executive chairman.  March 7  Broadcom sought again to soothe U.S. security concerns around its bid for Qualcomm, saying it would stick with investments aimed at maintaining the United States\u2019 leadership in 5G technology.  CFIUS, in an unusual move, stepped into Broadcom\u2019s hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm this week, citing a number of concerns on the development of the next generation of mobile networks and technology.  March 6  CFIUS identified potential risks that warrant a full investigation of Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm, a senior U.S. Treasury official said in a letter to the companies.  Some of the U.S. government\u2019s concerns relate to risks associated with Broadcom\u2019s relationships with foreign entities, Aimen Mir, the Treasury\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for investment security, said in the letter, without identifying who those parties might be.  The letter was dated March 5 and made public by Qualcomm.  Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm is in talks to settle a patent dispute with China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co and could reach an agreement in the coming weeks, citing people familiar with the matter.  March 5  Broadcom said the decision by CFIUS to review the deal was the result of secret moves made by Qualcomm on Jan. 29 to encourage an investigation into the offer.  Qualcomm said it was delaying its 2018 annual meeting to April 5 as a result of the CFIUS order.  Separately, Qualcomm, which is awaiting China\u2019s MOFCOM approval for the $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors NV, extended the tender offer to March 9 from March 5.  March 4  The U.S. government ordered the national security review of Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm that prompted Qualcomm to delay its March 6 shareholder meeting.  March 2  Broadcom was planning to complete its move back to the United States by mid-May, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.  Wrapping up the move from Singapore and redomiciling in the United States relatively quickly could remove a roadblock to Broadcom\u2019s proposed deal by calming concerns at the national security panel, CFIUS.  Feb. 27  CFIUS began looking at Broadcom\u2019s plan to take over Qualcomm, Reuters reported, citing three sources familiar with the matter.  Feb. 26  Qualcomm appears to warm to Broadcom\u2019s advances by saying the sides have grown closer on regulatory issues and called for talks on price after Broadcom\u2019s latest $117 billion offer. The war of words continued, however, as Broadcom called its U.S. semiconductor peer\u2019s proposal to negotiate a higher price \u201cengagement theater\u201d.  Feb. 21  Broadcom cut its bid for Qualcomm by $3 to $79 per share after Qualcomm raises its offer for NXP Semiconductors.  Feb. 20  Qualcomm deals a blow to Broadcom\u2019s raised bid by increasing its offer for NXP Semiconductors to $127.50 per share in cash from $110.  Feb. 14  Representatives of Broadcom and Qualcomm meet for the first time to discuss a potential combination; Qualcomm later calls the meeting \u201cconstructive\u201d.  Feb. 13  Broadcom scales back its challenge to Qualcomm\u2019s board by cutting the number of board seats it was trying to win to six from 11, following a meeting with proxy advisory firm ISS.  Feb. 8  Qualcomm rejects Broadcom\u2019s revised buyout offer of $121 bln, but proposes meeting to address the bid\u2019s \u201cserious deficiencies in value and certainty\u201d.  Feb. 5  Broadcom raises its offer for Qualcomm to $82 per share from $70 per share, calling the bid its \u201cbest and final offer\u201d.  The revised offer is contingent on either Qualcomm acquiring NXP Semiconductors for $38 billion or the NXP deal being terminated.  Jan. 17  The Federal Trade Commission investigates whether Broadcom engaged in anticompetitive tactics in negotiations with customers, casting further doubts on regulatory approval for potential deals.  Dec. 22, 2017  Qualcomm rejects Broadcom and private equity firm Silver Lake Partners\u2019 11 director nominees, setting the stage for a proxy battle.  Dec. 4 , 2017  Broadcom makes its first formal move toward a hostile bid to take over Qualcomm by nominating 11 directors to its rival\u2019s board.  Nov. 13, 2017  Qualcomm rejects Broadcom\u2019s $103 billion takeover bid, saying the offer undervalued the company and would face regulatory hurdles.  Nov. 6, 2017  Broadcom makes unsolicited $103 billion, or $70 per share, bid to acquire Qualcomm.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Monday announced 5G networking chips for a range of applications beyond smart phones, aiming to bolster a business that has lost Apple Inc as a major customer and faces unprecedented levels of competition.  San Diego-based Qualcomm is the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips and has told investors it expects a big boost from 5G networks, which will start rolling out this year and feature higher speeds than current 4G networks. Qualcomm chips will supply the 5G connectivity in devices such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd\u2019s Galaxy Fold smart phone.  But Qualcomm faces challenges in its mobile chip business, with Apple selecting Intel Corp alone to connect its iPhones released last year to mobile data networks. And MediaTek Inc, Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd have all announced plans to make 5G chips, with Samsung and Huawei both planning to use the chips in some models of their own phones, eating into potential business for Qualcomm.  At the Mobile World Congress event in Spain on Monday, Qualcomm announced its plans to get its 5G chips into other markets beyond phones. Qualcomm said it working with Japanese e-commerce retailer Rakuten Inc\u2019s mobile division to supply 5G chips for networking gear the retailer is rolling out in Japan.  Qualcomm also has a new chip for personal computers that would connect them to 5G networks, building on Qualcomm\u2019s earlier efforts to attack rival Intel in its core market of central processors. Qualcomm also announced chips for so-called 5G fixed wireless stations, which carriers such as Verizon Communications Inc are hoping could become speedy enough to replace home broadband connections that many consumers in the United States get from their cable operators.  Qualcomm also announced a new set of chips aimed at automakers on Monday. Qualcomm\u2019s existing chips help cars connect to the internet, but the 5G chips are expected to connect cars to other vehicles on the road as well as objects such as traffic signs and signals as vehicles gain new levels of autonomous navigation.","264":"(Adds analyst comment, number of licensees)  Jan 30 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc reported quarterly earnings that handily beat Wall Street views on Wednesday and said it had negotiated a new and slightly better interim patent contract with Huawei Technologies as it forecast current-quarter revenues in line with analyst estimates.  Shares of Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, rose nearly 2.6 percent in after-hours trading to $51.47.  The forecast allays investor concerns about a weak smart phone market in China and elsewhere and comes as a relief to investors after multiple other chipmakers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, Samsung and Intel Corp, delivered lower-than-expected sales forecasts this month, citing economic weakness in China.  Qualcomm, which generates most of its profits by licensing its technology to mobile phone makers and others, said that under the deal reached with Huawei, the Chinese company is paying $150 million per quarter for three quarters as the two work toward a final resolution of a licensing dispute. The first payment was made in the quarter ended in December.  Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, said the deal for the next three quarters is still less than Qualcomm believes it is owed but that the new deal is \u201con slightly better terms, which is very good.\u201d  The progress is a positive sign for the company\u2019s licensing business. Qualcomm said it now has signed 35 customers to its 5G licensing program and expects the business to generate between $1 billion and $1.1 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, roughly in line with analyst expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  That licensing revenue is \u201cslightly disappointing, but most were well aware of weakness in the handset market, so will be forgiven,\u201d said Christopher Rolland, an analyst with Susquehanna International Group. He said the Huawei deal was a \u201cstep in the right direction,\u201d though it was not yet final.  Legal worries around the company\u2019s licensing division have weighed heavily on Qualcomm over the past two years as it wages a costly and broad-ranging dispute with iPhone maker Apple Inc and government regulators.  In the fiscal first quarter, Qualcomm\u2019s modem chip shipments fell 21.5 percent to 186 million, but were better than analysts estimate of 185.4 million, according to FactSet.  Qualcomm said it expects current-quarter revenue of between $4.4 billion and $5.2 billion, meeting analysts\u2019 estimate of $4.80 billion at the midpoint, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cThe revenue outlook reflects the weakness of the smartphone trends in the March quarter, but we think Qualcomm might see catalysts from initial 5G smartphone launches,\u201d said Jun Zhang, managing director of Rosenblatt Securities.  Net income attributable to Qualcomm was $1.07 billion, or 87 cents per share, for the first quarter ended Dec. 30, compared with a loss of $5.98 billion, or $4.05 per share, a year earlier when it took a $6 billion tax charge.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.20 per share, topping the analyst average estimate of $1.09.  Revenue fell 20 percent to $4.84 billion, slightly missing the analyst average estimate of $4.90 billion.

The shareholders, which included hedge funds Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd and Soroban Capital Partners LP, held out for more than a year since the offer was made in 2016.

Appeal proceedings in the case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission are expected to begin in January, but Qualcomm\u2019s opponents are weighing in early to argue that the anti-trust decision should be allowed to stand.  Trade groups representing the U.S. units of BMW BMWG.DE, Ford Motor Co F.N, General Motors Co GM.N and Toyota Motor Co 7203.T, among others, made various claims about adverse effects of Qualcomm's licensing practices in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Qualcomm declined to comment.  Qualcomm has denied the FTC\u2019s anti-trust accusations and the court agreed to pause the decision after some government officials asked it to do so.  Continental said it gave up working with Qualcomm's chip rivals Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and MediaTek Inc 2454.TW because the licensing practices created too many legal risks. Continental and Denso said Qualcomm and other patent holders were refusing to license their technology to chipmakers that charge only a few dollars per chip, seeking instead to sign licenses only with carmakers whose vehicles cost tens of thousands of dollars and are \"less motivated to fight for every dollar\" in license fees.  \u201cThe resulting inefficiency is ultimately borne by consumers in the form of higher prices,\u201d the auto suppliers wrote in their complaint.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc and Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday opened a complex trial with the iPhone maker using a fried chicken analogy to illustrate its claim the chip company is abusing its market power while Qualcomm alleged a years-long plan by Apple to deprive it of billions in revenue, $13 at a time.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The fate of Qualcomm\u2019s business model, which involves licensing more than 130,000 patents in addition to selling chips, is at stake in the case, which consolidates related lawsuits and countersuits. Apple alleges that Qualcomm\u2019s patent practices were an illegal move to maintain a monopoly on the market for premium modem chips that connect smart phones to wireless data networks.  Qualcomm in turn says Apple used its heft in the electronics business to wrongly order contract factories such as Hon Hai Precision Co Ltd\u2019s Foxconn to withhold royalty payments from Qualcomm that Apple had historically reimbursed to the factories.  A jury of three women and six men will hear the case over five weeks in the San Diego federal courtroom of Judge Gonzalo Curiel. On Tuesday, attorneys sought to cut through the technological complexity and frame key elements of the case in terms the jury could understand.  Apple has objected to a practice that it calls \u201cno license, no chips\u201d under which Qualcomm will not sell chips to a company that has not signed a patent license agreement.

REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday introduced new chips designed to connect mobile phones to 5G networks that operate differently around the world.  Qualcomm is the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips. The San Diego, California-based company said its new X60 modem chip, along with a new antenna chip, will be the first to aggregate signals sent over the disparate frequencies used in the two variants of 5G networks, a feature the company said will help boost download speeds.  5G communications, which are intended to improve data transfer speeds and connect more devices to the internet, are expected to be in wide use by the end of 2020. Qualcomm has said it believes between 175 million and 225 million 5G smart phones will be sold in 2020.  In many regions, 5G networks use so-called sub-6 frequencies, but in some major markets such as the United States, the networks will also use \u201cmillimeter wave\u201d frequencies to deliver faster data speeds in dense areas such as cities.  Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips can handle both variants, and the company said the X60 chip is the first to offer what is called carrier aggregation for both kinds of 5G. Using carrier aggregation, telecommunications companies can send data over multiple bands of wireless spectrum at once to generate faster speeds.  Qualcomm designs chips but has them manufactured by outside partners. The company said the X60 chip will be made using 5-nanometer chip technology, which makes the chips smaller and more power-efficient. Qualcomm did not disclose who would manufacture the chips, but Reuters reported on Tuesday that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd had won the orders.  Qualcomm said it would start sending samples of the chips to its customers in the first quarter of this year and that they would start to show up in premium smart phones in early 2021.","279":"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm QCOM.O will refile as early as Monday an application with the Chinese government to clear its $44 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors NXPI.O, sources said, giving regulators more time to decide on the deal and averting a collapse.  FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The San Diego-based firm withdrew its earlier antitrust application on Saturday at the request of China\u2019s commerce ministry, just days before the regulator\u2019s April 17 deadline to decide on the transaction expires, the sources said.  Clinching the NXP takeover, the world\u2019s biggest in the semiconductor sector, is crucial to Qualcomm, which is seeking to diversify its customer base and become the leading chip supplier to the fast-growing automotive market.  The U.S. chipmaker has already received approval from eight of nine required global regulators to finalize the acquisition, with Chinese clearance the only one pending.  By refiling, Qualcomm will provide the Ministry of Commerce (Mofcom) potentially with another six-month window to review its application. It will be the second time Qualcomm would be refiling its antitrust application with Mofcom.  Analysts, however, said a decision by Mofcom on the deal is unlikely to come before trade and investment tensions between China and the United States are resolved.  \u201cQualcomm is going to have to wait for Washington and Beijing to resolve their differences before this deal is going to move forward,\u201d said Erick Robinson, director of patent litigation and licensing at Beijing East IP.  Earlier this month, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump proposed $50 billion worth of tariffs on some 1,300 industrial, technology, transport and medical products to force changes in Beijing\u2019s intellectual property practices.  Beijing immediately responded with a list of proposed duties of $50 billion on key American imports.  China\u2019s isn\u2019t blocking the deal, \u201cbut they are holding it hostage\u201d, said Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China and North Asia at risk consultancy Control Risks, adding he had heard about Qualcomm\u2019s application withdrawal and planned refiling.  Qualcomm was facing the \u201cperfect storm\u201d for a U.S. company in China, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s at the heart of everything: there\u2019s a national security angle, there\u2019s a competitive and Chinese industrial policy angle - so it\u2019s caught up in all the trade war stuff.\u201d  Qualcomm declined to comment. Mofcom didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.  Antitrust concerns were believed to have been raised during the most recent round of discussions, but Qualcomm\u2019s position was these were unfounded and not related to the deal, the sources said.  Qualcomm is understood to have offered a series of guarantees to Mofcom to assure that NXP customers wouldn\u2019t need to also purchase Qualcomm licenses.  The U.S. chipmaker, which initially announced its bid for the Dutch semiconductor company in October 2016, said in February that it was raising its bid to $127.50 per share, valuing NXP at $44 billion.  That sweetener came weeks before Trump, citing national security, ordered rival Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O to halt its proposed $117 billion buyout of Qualcomm.  Shares in Qualcomm have dropped about 13 percent since the start of the year, while NXP stock has shed about 3 percent over the same period.","280":"Feb 22 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc:  * QUALCOMM BOARD OF DIRECTORS SENDS LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS  * QUALCOMM INC SAYS URGES STOCKHOLDERS TO VOTE FOR RE-ELECTION OF CO\u2019S 11 BOARD MEMEBERS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","281":"FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is shown outside one of the company's many buildings in San Diego, California, U.S., September 17, 2020.

The regulator asked the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for an \u201cen banc\u201d hearing before an 11-judge panel. Last month, a three-judge panel at the appeals court reversed a lower court decision against the San Diego-based company, the largest supplier of chips for mobile phones and a major source of wireless communications technology for 5G networks.  The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals also vacated an injunction that would have required Qualcomm to change its intellectual property licensing practices. In addition to chips, Qualcomm owns industry-standard wireless technology and requires all smartphone makers to license those patents.  The company does not sell chips to companies that do not hold a license to a package of those patents and others, but at trial evidence emerged that Qualcomm would lower the patent fees for customers that bought its chips.  The lower court ruled that those practices amounted to an anticompetitive surcharge on rival chips. The three-judge panel of the appeals court disagreed, saying that because those practices were founded in patent law and applied neutrally to all players they could not harm Qualcomm\u2019s chip rivals.  The FTC on Friday argued that ruling was a legal error.  \u201cThe panel\u2019s errors have cast doubt on fundamental matters of antitrust principle and will encourage monopolists to cloak anticompetitive practices beneath false invocations of patent law and the appearance of neutrality,\u201d the FTC wrote in its filing.

TSMC is the world\u2019s biggest contract chipmaker and manufactures semiconductors for Apple Inc, Qualcomm Inc and a range of other technology companies. The company in May disclosed its intentions to build a 5-nanometer chip factory in Arizona, which would be its first advanced manufacturing facility in the United States. Earlier this month it approved an investment to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in the U.S. state with paid-in capital of $3.5 billion.  The Phoenix City Council voted to allow the city to enter the agreement by a vote of 9-0. Ahead of the vote, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego called the agreement \u201ca great success across so many levels of government in helping Arizona become a leader in advanced manufacturing.\u201d  Under the agreement, TSMC will build a new factory and create 1,900 new full-time jobs to be phased in over a five-year period. Construction would start in early 2021, with factory production expected in 2024.  In return, the city will build three miles of streets for $61 million, spend $37 million on water infrastructure improvements and $107 million in wastewater improvements. The company will enter a formal deal with the city after selecting a site, which is expected before the end of the year.  Based in Hsinchu, Taiwan, TSMC has said it also hopes for U.S. federal subsidies to help cover the extra cost of building chips in the United States. Most of the world\u2019s advanced semiconductors are manufactured in Taiwan, including those used in U.S. military equipment, which has become a cause for concern as tensions increase between the United States and China.  American lawmakers in June proposed billions of dollars in subsides to help bolster advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Those funds could benefit both TSMC as well as U.S. firms such as Intel Corp and Micron Technology Inc.","286":"MUNICH\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chip supplier Qualcomm Inc won a second court skirmish in its worldwide patent battle with Apple Inc on Thursday, with the iPhone maker saying it would pull some older models from its German stores.  FILE PHOTO: Apple staff hold iPhone X packages at the Apple Store in Berlin, Germany, November 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Hannibal Hanschke\/File Photo  Qualcomm\u2019s win in Germany comes weeks after it secured a court order to ban sales of some iPhone models in China. Apple, which is contesting both rulings, has continued to offer its iPhones in China but made changes to its iOS operating system in the wake of the Chinese order.  The German victory may affect only a few million iPhones out of the hundreds of millions that Apple sells each year. Still, it is a small but clear win in a complex legal battle that will spin into overdrive in the coming months as antitrust regulators and Apple both take Qualcomm to court in the United States.  Apple alleges that Qualcomm engaged in illegal behavior to preserve a monopoly on modem chips, which help mobile devices connect to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has in turn accused Apple of using the chip supplier\u2019s vast stable of technology innovations without proper compensation.  While a sales ban in China could hurt Apple\u2019s bottom line, it is unlikely the two patent skirmishes will sway the outcome of the broader battle, where Qualcomm has suffered a series of setbacks fighting U.S. antitrust regulators.  Shares of Apple were down 2.3 percent at $157.12 in late trading, weighing on the broader market.  Qualcomm shares were down 0.2 percent at $56.69.  Qualcomm is not pursuing the software patents in the Chinese case in other jurisdictions and suffered an early loss while pursuing a U.S. sales ban on the U.S. version of the hardware patent at issue in Germany.  OLDER PHONES PULLED  On Thursday, Apple said it would pull older iPhones from its German stores after a court ruled that Apple had infringed a hardware patent of Qualcomm Inc and banned sales of iPhones there with chips from Apple supplier Qorvo Inc.  \u201cTwo respected courts in two different jurisdictions just in the past two weeks have now confirmed the value of Qualcomm\u2019s patents and declared Apple an infringer, ordering a ban on iPhones in the important markets of Germany and China,\u201d Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement.  For each of the two Apple entities it won orders against, Qualcomm needs to post a bond of about 668.4 million euros, or $765.9 million, before it can begin proceedings to enforce the order, a move Qualcomm said it would carry out \u201cwithin a few days.\u201d  The smartphone maker said it was appealing the decision, but the order goes into effect as soon as Qualcomm posts the bond.  Apple said it would pull some phones from its stores while it pursued an appeal.  \u201cWe are of course disappointed by this verdict and we plan to appeal,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cAll iPhone models remain available to customers through carriers and resellers in 4,300 locations across Germany. During the appeal process, iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models will not be available at Apple\u2019s 15 retail stores in Germany. iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR will remain available in all our stores.\u201d  Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with research firm Bernstein, said in a note that Germnany was a small iPhone market for Apple, selling about 10 million units a year, with possibly only half of those being the older models affected by the court\u2019s order.  When Qualcomm posts the bond to enforce the order, it could seek to extend the ban to Apple\u2019s resellers and the newer iPhone models not included thus far, legal experts said.  Qualcomm said the court had granted its request for \u201ca recall and destruction of all accused devices from all retailers in Germany.\u201d  RISKS  But pressing forward with enforcement presents some risks for Qualcomm. In an earlier proceeding before the U.S. International Trade Commission, U.S. regulators viewed a more extensive set of technical evidence about whether Qorvo\u2019s chips and Apple\u2019s phones violated Qualcomm\u2019s patents.  Those U.S. regulators sided with Apple and Qorvo. If higher courts in Germany do the same when Apple appeals, Qualcomm could be forced to forfeit its bond if the decision becomes final.  The German case is Qualcomm\u2019s third major effort to secure a ban on Apple\u2019s lucrative iPhones over patent infringement allegations after similar efforts in the U.S. and China.  In the United States, Qualcomm sought to ban the import of iPhones with chips from Intel Corp. Trade regulators found Apple had infringed one Qualcomm patent, but so far declined to ban the phones with Intel chips because regulators feared it would hurt competition in the chip marketplace.  \u201cCompetition authorities around the world have repeatedly found Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices unlawful, yet Qualcomm continues to try to achieve the same results through a campaign of patent lawsuits,\u201d Steven Rodgers, Intel\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement after the ruling in Germany.  In Germany, the judge ruled that phones with a chip from Apple supplier Qorvo violate one of Qualcomm\u2019s patents around so-called envelope tracking, a feature that helps mobile phones save battery power while sending and receiving wireless signals.  Mike Baker, Qorvo\u2019s chief intellectual property counsel, said in a statement that U.S. trade regulators had ruled that Qorvo\u2019s chips did not violate the U.S. version of Qualcomm\u2019s patent and that the chip\u2019s inventor wasn\u2019t allowed to testify at the German hearing.  \u201cWe believe our envelope tracking chip does not infringe the patent in suit, and the court would have come to a different conclusion if it had considered all the evidence,\u201d Baker said.  In China, Apple is still pursuing a so-called request for reconsideration with the court that issued the bans.  Apple said its phones remained on sale and it believed it has complied with the Chinese court\u2019s order, but it also made changes to its iPhone software in the wake of the ruling. Qualcomm believes Apple is violating the Chinese court order despite the new software and must stop selling phones there.","287":"(Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O cut the number of board seats it was trying to win at Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O to six from 11 on Tuesday, saying this would let Qualcomm shareholders push the U.S. chip maker toward a sale while ensuring continuity.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The move came following Singapore-based Broadcom\u2019s meeting with proxy advisory firm ISS on Monday and concern from some Qualcomm shareholders that replacing the company\u2019s entire 11-member board could create uncertainty during the time it would take to complete a combination of the two companies.  The move on board seats comes a day ahead of planned talks between the semiconductor companies to discuss Broadcom\u2019s $121 billion cash-and-stock acquisition offer, which will be their first such discussion.  Broadcom said the change would let Qualcomm stockholders direct a simple majority of the board to negotiate a deal while also ensuring that the remaining five directors who are familiar with the company continue to oversee it.  Broadcom\u2019s six nominees are Samih Elhage, David Golden, Veronica Hagen, Julie Hill, John Kispert and Harry You. The company said it would withdraw its offer if it was not accepted by Qualcomm\u2019s executives or unless its six nominees were elected at Qualcomm\u2019s shareholder meeting scheduled for March 6.  Qualcomm offered no comment.  The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices.  Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily licenses its technology for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  The difference in their business models has led to Qualcomm raising concerns that its licensing agreements with customers could be upended should a deal with Broadcom be announced.  It has warned that regulators could take more than 18 months to approve the deal, and may never do so. Broadcom has countered it believes it can complete the deal in 12 months.  Qualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years, but the relationship soured last year when Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refused to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple and Qualcomm are now locked in a bitter legal dispute.  Broadcom raised its cash-and-stock offer last week to $82 per share from $70, and made other concessions. They include offering to pay Qualcomm an $8 billion breakup fee should antitrust regulators block the deal.  Qualcomm rejected the revised offer, as it did the first bid, saying the proposal undervalued the company and fell well short of commitments on regulatory issues.","288":"Aug 24 (Reuters) - A group of tech companies and automakers including Ford Motor Co, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Daimler AG on Monday urged the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to seek an appeal after its loss in a case against chip supplier Qualcomm Inc.  Earlier this month a U.S. appeals court reversed a lower-court decision against Qualcomm, which makes technology for connecting devices to mobile data networks. The court also vacated an injunction that would have required Qualcomm to change its patent licensing practices.  Qualcomm was fighting a May 2019 decision by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California in a case brought by the FTC. Koh sided with the FTC, writing that Qualcomm\u2019s practice of requiring phone makers to sign a patent license agreement before selling them chips \u201cstrangled competition\u201d and harmed consumers.  Automakers have increasingly put chips in vehicles to connect them to the internet, which requires them to sign patent agreements for communications standards such as 5G. The companies had previously argued that connected car prices could go up if Qualcomm won its case.  Qualcomm won its appeal of that ruling before the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in an Aug. 11 ruling by a three-judge panel. In a letter sent Monday, the automakers - as well as Qualcomm rivals Intel Corp and MediaTek Inc - urged the FTC to seek an \u201cen banc\u201d rehearing of the case by the full appeals court.  \u201cIf allowed to stand, the panel\u2019s decision could destabilize the standards ecosystem by encouraging the abuse of market power acquired through collaborative standard-setting,\u201d the group said.

Singapore-based Broadcom, however, said it would continue with its plans to redomicile to the United States, fueling expectations that the company would likely scout for smaller targets.  \u201cQualcomm was clearly a unique and very large acquisition opportunity,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Tom Krause told investors on a conference call. \u201cGiven the maturity of the industry, the consolidation it is seeing and our relative size now, our future acquisitions are much more likely to be funded with cash available on our balance sheet and without the need to flex the balance sheet.\u201d  Broadcom\u2019s shares were down 1.2 percent at $264.50 in extended trading on Thursday.  \u201cTypically, Broadcom has to make acquisitions to drive the earnings,\u201d said Summit Insight Group analyst Kinngai Chan. \u201cIf the company is able to make two or three medium-size acquisitions, then I think the stock will move up again.\u201d  But Broadcom officials were still publicly smarting over the loss of the Qualcomm deal. Krause said he was \u201ctouched\u201d by an Institutional Shareholder Services report Wednesday encouraging Qualcomm shareholders to cast protest ballots for Broadcom\u2019s director nominees.  Krause said Broadcom believes that \u201cbased on the vote tally as of today, the 11 Qualcomm nominees are only garnering between 15 percent to 16 percent of the outstanding shares, not necessarily something to celebrate on San Diego.\u201d Qualcomm declined to comment on Krause\u2019s comments.  Broadcom, whose WiFi chips are found in Apple Inc's AAPL.O iPhone and most Android phones, was eyeing Qualcomm's core baseband chips and license business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  Broadcom said first-quarter smart phone results were driven by an increase in orders from a \"North American smartphone customer,\" which most analysts believe is Apple Inc AAPL.O, which released its flagship iPhone X later than normal last year, pushing production into the early part of this year.  CEO Hock Tan said that customer\u2019s business was expected to \u201ctrend down sharply\u201d in the second quarter, partially offset at Broadcom by more business for a \u201cnext-generation flagship [phone] from a large Korean smartphone customer.\u201d  Net income attributable to ordinary shares surged to $6.23 billion, or $14.62 per share, in the first quarter ended Feb. 4, from $239 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier.  The company, which announced a quarterly interim dividend of $1.75 per share, said it recorded a gain of $5.79 billion due to the recently enacted U.S. tax law.  Excluding items, the company earned $5.12 per share.  Net revenue rose to $5.33 billion from $4.14 billion.  Analysts on average had expected earnings of $5.05 per share and revenue of $5.32 billion.

A Qualcomm sign is seen during the China International Import Expo (CIIE), at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Aly Song  The International Trade Commission, a government agency empowered to hear disputes over patented technology, issued a final ruling in one case that went in Apple\u2019s favor while an ITC administrative judge made a non-binding recommendation that supported Qualcomm in another.  In both cases Qualcomm Inc sought to have imports of Apple Inc iPhone 7, 8 and X models containing chips made by Intel Corp banned. Because iPhones are made overseas, banning imports would choke Apple\u2019s sales of the phones in the United States.  The two American companies have been locked for two years in a legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  \u201cQualcomm is using these cases to distract from having to answer for the real issues, their monopolistic business practices,\u201d Apple said in a statement.  After praising the first decision in its favor, Qualcomm said it would seek \u201creconsideration\u201d of the second decision because it was at odds with a jury trial that the chip supplier won earlier this month in federal court in San Diego, where jurors found Apple infringed three Qualcomm patents.  \u201cThe Commission\u2019s decision is inconsistent with the recent unanimous jury verdict finding infringement of the same patent after Apple abandoned its invalidity defense at the end of trial,\u201d Qualcomm said in a statement. \u201cWe will seek reconsideration by the Commission in view of the jury verdict.\u201d  Gaston Kroub, a patent lawyer in New York not involved in the cases, said Qualcomm\u2019s strategy at the ITC was to use the threat of an import ban to pressure Apple into reaching a settlement of all patent and antitrust claims between the companies.  \u201cQualcomm will be happy they got at least something, but at the end of day, with this final determination, Apple will be emboldened to think it can continue to ward off Qualcomm\u2019s attacks,\u201d Kroub said. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything here that would impact Apple\u2019s defense strategy.\u201d  The focus moves now to skirmishes that will likely be more important. A ruling is expected soon in an antitrust case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission accusing Qualcomm of abusing a monopoly on mobile chip technology.  A case brought by Apple making similar claims goes to trial in April in California over allegations Qualcomm seeks inflated royalties for licensing its technology in violation of antitrust laws.  After the non-binding decision in Qualcomm\u2019s favor was announced on Tuesday, Apple shares closed down 1 percent to $186.79 in regular trading, and Qualcomm closed up 2.4 percent to $58.  But the stocks reversed direction in late trading after the announcement of the binding decision that favored Apple. Apple shares were up .73 percent and Qualcomm shares down .69 percent.  Qualcomm has filed lawsuits in the United States, China, Germany and other countries accusing iPhone of using its technology without authorization.  Qualcomm has won sales bans against Apple in China and Germany, though the China ban has not been enforced and Apple resumed sales of phones in Germany by shipping phones with only Qualcomm chips.  Apple has also racked up victories by having many of Qualcomm\u2019s patents invalidated, at least on a preliminary basis. And the chip supplier has been dealt setbacks in its FTC trial, where a pre-trial ruling forced it to license its technology to other chip firms.  Of the two cases decided on Tuesday by the ITC, the ruling favorable to Apple can only be appealed to a federal court. The ruling favorable to Qualcomm faces review by the full six-member ITC, which will make a final decision.","294":"March 5 (Reuters) - A U.S. national security panel\u2019s unusual decision to review Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd\u2019s $117 billion hostile bid for smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm Ltd illustrates an expanding focus on the competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry amid advances by China, regulatory experts said.  The secretive panel, called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), has scuppered several attempts by Chinese technology companies to acquire U.S. chipmakers in the last 12 months over concerns about the transfer of potentially sensitive technology.  Broadcom is not a Chinese company, and has pledged to move its domicile from Singapore to the United States, arguing this will makes its acquisition of Qualcomm not covered by CFIUS. However, many of Qualcomm\u2019s rivals, including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, are Chinese.  Huawei is forging closer commercial ties with big telecommunication operators across Asia, the Americas and Europe, putting the company in prime position to lead the global race for wireless 5G networks, despite U.S. allegations it poses a security threat.  CFIUS views Qualcomm as a prized U.S. asset in the development of 5G wireless technology, which allows for the transmission of data at very fast speeds. It wants to make sure Qualcomm does not lose its status as a dominant player in wireless chip technology, according to a source familiar with the panel\u2019s thinking.  As a result, Broadcom\u2019s business plan for Qualcomm, including any divestitures it plans in order to appease antitrust regulators, will be scrutinized by CFIUS, lawyers who advised companies on their CFIUS applications said.  \u201cThis shows how indirect exposure to China is a frequent, but under-noticed, source of perceived national security risk,\u201d said Mario Mancuso, a former CFIUS member who is now a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP.  CFIUS\u2019 stance has toughened as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to pressure China to help tackle North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions and be more accommodative on trade and foreign exchange issues.  Unfilled political vacancies in several government departments and agencies have also made it harder for CFIUS to approve deals.  Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC, a U.S.-based private equity firm funded by the Chinese government, saw its $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor Corp collapse last year after it was blocked by CFIUS, a rejection subsequently upheld by Trump.  Last month, U.S. semiconductor testing company Xcerra Corp said CFIUS had blocked its $580 million sale to a Chinese state-backed semiconductor investment fund.  Reuters reported last week that CFIUS had begun looking at Broadcom\u2019s bid as pressure grew from politicians, including senior Republican U.S. Senator John Cornyn.  \u201cQualcomm is a leader in 5G technology, which is going to be the new standard in the future. And, as we\u2019ve seen, some of our international rivals, like China, have been incredibly aggressive and strategic,\u201d Cornyn said on Monday. He has proposed legislation to tighten CFIUS\u2019 scrutiny of deals.  PROXY CONTEST  CFIUS\u2019 intervention was unusual in that the panel typically reviews signed deals. However, Qualcomm has been resisting Broadcom\u2019s overtures, prompting the latter to nominate six directors to Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board at its shareholder meeting. CFIUS on Sunday ordered Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, which was scheduled for Tuesday, for a month.  Qualcomm filed a voluntary request for CFIUS to review Broadcom\u2019s bid on Jan. 29. CFIUS rules allow a company facing an unsolicited takeover bid to request a CFIUS review, so that its board of directors can better assess the regulatory risk of a deal.  \u201cThe rules say that one party alone could approach CFIUS and for a review,\u201d said McDermott Will & Emery LLP regulatory lawyer David Levine.  Such circumstances are few and far between. Miner Rio Tinto Plc asked CFIUS for a review in 2008 after facing a hostile $150 billion bid by BHP Billiton Ltd, according to a source familiar with the matter. CFIUS allowed the bid, but BHP subsequently walked away from the deal in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  Broadcom struggled to win CFIUS approval to buy Brocade Communications Systems late last year. In the end, that approval came just weeks after Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan announced in an Oval Office ceremony with Trump that Broadcom would bring its headquarters to the United States.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  Qualcomm provides the chips for so-called infotainment systems as well as dashboard displays, but is also trying to fight its way into the market for self-driving car systems as they emerge.  Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon told Reuters in an interview ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that the company\u2019s backlog of design wins - that is, instances where carmakers plan to include Qualcomm\u2019s chip in future vehicles - has reached $5.5 billion, up slightly from the $5 billion Qualcomm officials disclosed last year.  The reach into the automotive market is important for Qualcomm because its biggest chip market - mobile phones - is stagnating, though Qualcomm also said on Monday that the number of device makers working on 5G devices to be released in 2019 has grown to 30 from 20, with most of them smartphones.  In fending off a hostile takeover bid from Broadcom Inc AVGO.O last year, Qualcomm promised investors it would look to new markets like automobiles for future revenue growth. The effort became more critical after Chinese regulators scuttled Qualcomm's planned $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O last summer.  Qualcomm will sell three levels of car computing platforms, from entry-level to expensive: Performance, Premiere and Paramount. Amon said the intention is to provide a budget-friendly option to automakers so they can put more complex computing systems into ever-cheaper cars.  On some of the most inexpensive cars where automakers struggle to earn healthy profit, revenue generated from selling services to drivers over those computers could bring in extra revenue for automakers, Amon said.  \u201cWe are going to have a tier of products for every single kind of car. We are in the automotive market to stay.\u201d  Qualcomm also said it was working with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O to offer more Amazon services through car computers. While some carmakers are already offering Amazon's virtual assistant, Alexa, in their vehicles, Qualcomm and Amazon said they are working to put Amazon Music, Prime Video, Fire TV and Audible, Amazon's audiobook business, on car computers powered by Qualcomm.  The move competes directly with Apple Inc AAPL.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, which have been wooing automakers to adopt software that lets the tech companies' phones show up on a car computer's main screen.","298":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc said on Tuesday that it has entered into a new five-year patent license agreement with LG Electronics Inc to develop, manufacture and sell 3G, 4G and 5G smartphones.

REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  The world\u2019s no. 1 chipmaker had already provided the information after being ordered to pay a daily fine for withholding it, but the Luxembourg-based General Court\u2019s ruling is expected to strengthen the Commission\u2019s hand in future similar cases.  Qualcomm has been under the EU spotlight since 2015, when it was accused of predatory pricing between 2009 and 2011 aimed at forcing out British phone software maker Icera, subsequently bought by Nvidia Corp.  As part of the investigation, the Commission in January 2017 told Qualcomm to provide more information.  The company said the request went beyond the investigation\u2019s scope and took its grievance to the General Court.  While waiting for a judgment, Qualcomm however acceded to the EU demand to avoid a daily 580,000 euro ($655,000) penalty for its delayed response.  The Luxembourg-based court on Tuesday dismissed the company\u2019s case.  \u201cThe Court finds that the scope of the investigation as defined in the statement of objections, at the state-of-play meeting of 3 September 2015 and at the hearing on 10 November 2016 has not been extended,\u201d judges said.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The results come as chip shortages force automakers such as General Motors Co on Wednesday to cut production at multiple plants. While Qualcomm does not make the chips that are holding up automotive plants, the company works with some of the same chip contract manufacturers that are backed up.

The share price declines for the San Diego, California-based chip designer came even as it forecast fiscal second-quarter sales and profits above Wall Street expectations, driven by a wave of phone buyers around the world upgrading their devices for 5G network connectivity.  Wall Street had expected healthy gains for the company after the U.S. government blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, a move that made it difficult for the Chinese brand to build handsets. Analysts had expected much of its market share in the premium smartphone market to flow to Android-based rival makers who use Qualcomm\u2019s chips, but the gains disappointed investors.  \u201cNow with the change in the market, we have kind of 16% of the market that was not available to us before being available.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Qualcomm\u2019s strategy is changing as its chips become more profitable and a bigger part of its business, but a concurrent decline in its lucrative license revenues held its gross margins flat.  For the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 27, Qualcomm said sales and adjusted profit were $8.24 billion and $2.17 per share, compared with analyst estimates of $8.27 billion and $2.10 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Chip and licensing revenue were $6.53 billion and $1.66 billion, respectively, beating estimates, according to FactSet data.  Qualcomm forecast sales with a midpoint of $7.6 billion and adjusted profit at a midpoint of $1.65 per share, slightly above expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Qualcomm is the world\u2019s biggest supplier of chips that help mobile phones connect to cellular data networks, providing chips to Apple Inc and other handset makers. Qualcomm disclosed Wednesday that chip sales to Apple are slightly less profitable than chip sales to other phone makers because Apple does not also buy additional software from Qualcomm in the way that Android device makers do.  But the company is also building out businesses supplying chips to automakers such as General Motors, which last week disclosed a deal to source chips from Qualcomm, and challenging Intel Corp with new processors for laptop and desktop computers.  Two of the company\u2019s newer business lines - radio frequency chips to help devices handle newer 5G signals and internet-of-things chips for devices such as wireless headphones - have now become billion-dollar-per-quarter businesses.  Cristiano Amon, the company\u2019s president who will take over as chief executive in June, said the company was \u201cwell hedged\u201d among chip suppliers because it sources parts from multiple contract manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. But he added that demand was outstripping supply as rivals of Huawei, which largely did not use Qualcomm\u2019s chips, moved in to take the Chinese brand\u2019s market share.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing growth of share in a preeminent high tier,\u201d Amon said.  Qualcomm forecast a midpoint of $6.25 billion in revenue for its chip business in the fiscal second quarter, beating estimates of $5.62 billion, according to data from FactSet. Qualcomm forecast a midpoint of sales for its licensing business, which has higher margins than its chip business and generates much of its profit, of $1.35 billion, lower than estimates of $1.43 billion, according to FactSet.  The higher sales of chips - and chips with better margins - accounted for the company\u2019s above-expectations profit forecast despite falling short of estimates for its licensing business, Palkhiwala told Reuters.  Qualcomm said first-quarter sales for handset chips were $4.22 billion, jumping 79% from a year before on the strength of 5G phone upgrades.

REUTERS\/Pichi Chuang  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Washington has waded into Broadcom\u2019s effort to buy rival chipmaker Qualcomm for $117 billion. America\u2019s foreign-investment watchdog has told Qualcomm to delay by 30 days its annual shareholder meeting, previously set for Tuesday. The agenda includes director elections that could give board control to nominees of Singapore-based Broadcom. It\u2019s a surprising twist in an already tangled situation. But it may remove a big unknown from the equation.  Broadcom is blaming its target, saying Qualcomm sought a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and didn\u2019t tell its shareholders or its suitor. If true, it counts as one of the sneakier ways to fend off a hostile takeover. Still, the U.S. Treasury-led CFIUS makes its own decisions.  While the committee\u2019s latest pre-emptive move is highly unusual, it\u2019s not illogical. Having decamped to Singapore in search of lower taxes, Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan has promised to return his acquisitive $100 billion firm to the United States. That process could be completed in a few months, but for now Tan\u2019s company is foreign, and it\u2019s trying to make a big purchase in an important technology sector \u2013 one where U.S. lawmakers have made no secret of their intensifying sensitivities.  CFIUS national-security reviews usually come after mergers are agreed. In this case, though, the uncommon circumstances may explain the early action. Broadcom has proposed six directors for Qualcomm\u2019s 11-person board. Key proxy advisers have backed at least some of Broadcom\u2019s slate, and that means the Singapore group\u2019s nominees could end up controlling the U.S. company\u2019s board \u2013 before any takeover is agreed by the two firms or their shareholders.  Qualcomm gave Broadcom\u2019s initial offer in November the cold shoulder but is now engaged in discussions, although not whole-heartedly. It\u2019s also motivated to secure the last remaining antitrust approval for its own planned $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors. Getting that deal in the bag would boost its stand-alone outlook, and CFIUS\u2019s intervention buys more time.  If Broadcom is prepared to wait rather than walk away, though, the calculus for Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders will become simpler. There are many other obstacles to a merger, including potential antitrust concerns in Washington and elsewhere. If a decision is now delayed until Broadcom\u2019s domicile is no longer a sticking point, that will at least remove one uncertainty.","305":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday said it will supply a range of chips for General Motors Co\u2019s next generation of vehicles.

Broadcom had initially made a $103 billion offer for Qualcomm in early November.","307":"(Reuters) - Mobile phone chip supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday won a legal victory against iPhone maker Apple Inc, with a jury in federal court in San Diego finding that Apple owes Qualcomm about $31 million for infringing three of its patents.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Qualcomm last year sued Apple alleging it had violated patents related to helping mobile phones get better battery life. During an eight-day trial, Qualcomm asked the jury to award it unpaid patent royalties of up to $1.41 per iPhone that violated the patents.  The $31 million penalty is small change for Apple, the second most valuable U.S. company after Microsoft Corp, with a market value of $866 billion and annual revenue totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. But the setting of a per-phone royalty rate for Qualcomm\u2019s technology gives the chip supplier a fresh line of attack in its two-year old legal battle with Apple.  The biggest case, filed by Apple in early 2017, begins in April. Apple has sought to dismantle what it calls Qualcomm\u2019s illegal business model of both licensing patents and selling chips to phone makers. Qualcomm has accused Apple of using its technology without paying.  \u201cThe technologies invented by Qualcomm and others are what made it possible for Apple to enter the market and become so successful so quickly,\u201d Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement. \u201cWe are gratified that courts all over the world are rejecting Apple\u2019s strategy of refusing to pay for the use of our IP.\u201d  In a statement, Apple said it was disappointed with the outcome.  \u201cQualcomm\u2019s ongoing campaign of patent infringement claims is nothing more than an attempt to distract from the larger issues they face with investigations into their business practices in U.S. federal court, and around the world,\u201d Apple said. It declined to comment on whether it would appeal.  In other cases against Apple, Qualcomm has won sales bans on iPhones in Germany and China, though the Chinese ban has not been enforced and Apple has taken moves it believes allow it to resume sales in Germany.  Qualcomm also suffered a setback with U.S. trade regulators who found that some iPhones infringed one of the San Diego-based company\u2019s patents but declined to bar their importation into the United States, citing the damage such a move would inflict on rival Intel Corp.  The verdict on Friday could come into play in the trial in April because it puts a per-phone dollar figure on some of Qualcomm\u2019s intellectual property. Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing model relies on charging phone makers a cut of the selling price of the phone, a practice Apple has alleged is unfair and illegal.  During an earlier trial between Qualcomm and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Apple executives outlined their company\u2019s extensive negotiations to reduce those license fees to $7.50 per phone for Qualcomm\u2019s patents.  The San Diego jury valued just three of Qualcomm\u2019s patents in the company\u2019s portfolio at $1.41, a figure that the chip supplier believes bolsters its contention that its licensing practices are fair.  \u201cThe three patents found to be infringed in this case represent just a small fraction of Qualcomm\u2019s valuable portfolio of tens of thousands of patents,\u201d Rosenberg said in a statement.  Gaston Kroub, a patent lawyer in New York not involved in the case, said the verdict was clearly a win for Qualcomm. But it does not say much about the value of Qualcomm\u2019s entire patent portfolio and was unlikely to spark settlements discussions, he said.  \u201cApple is very skilled at handling appeals and taking a longer-term view. This isn\u2019t something that will bring Apple to the table with any sense of urgency,\u201d Kroub said.","308":"","309":"March 5 (Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd:  * BROADCOM DISAPPOINTED WILL OF QUALCOMM STOCKHOLDERS TO BE DEFERRED  * WAS INFORMED ON SUNDAY NIGHT THAT ON JANUARY 29, QUALCOMM SECRETLY FILED A VOLUNTARY REQUEST WITH CFIUS  * BROADCOM - REQUEST WITH CFIUS TO INITIATE INVESTIGATION, RESULTING IN DELAY OF QUALCOMM\u2019S ANNUAL MEETING 48 HOURS BEFORE IT WAS TO TAKE PLACE  * REMAINS ON TRACK TO COMPLETE REDOMICILIATION NO LATER THAN MAY 6, 2018 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","310":"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday blocked microchip maker Broadcom Ltd'sAVGO.O proposed takeover of Qualcomm IncQCOM.O on national security grounds, ending what would have been the technology industry's biggest deal ever amid concerns that it would give China the upper hand in mobile communications.  The presidential order reflected a calculation that the United States\u2019 lead in creating technology and setting standards for the next generation of mobile cell phone communications would be lost to China if Singapore-based Broadcom took over San Diego-based Qualcomm, according to a White House official.  Qualcomm has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] in the sector, making Qualcomm a prized asset.  Qualcomm had earlier rebuffed Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid, which was under investigation by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a multi-agency panel led by the Treasury Department that reviews the national security implications of acquisitions of U.S. corporations by foreign companies.  In a letter on March 5, CFIUS said it was investigating whether Broadcom would starve Qualcomm of research dollars that would allow it to compete and also cited the risk of Broadcom\u2019s relationship with \u201cthird party foreign entities.\u201d  While it did not identify those entities, the letter repeatedly described Qualcomm as the leading company in so-called 5G technology development and standard setting.  \u201cA shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States,\u201d CFIUS said. \u201cWhile the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover.\u201d  NATIONAL SECURITY AND HUAWEI  A White House official on Monday confirmed that the national security concerns related to the risks of Broadcom\u2019s relationship with third party foreign entities.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  A source familiar with CFIUS\u2019 thinking had said that, if the deal was completed, the U.S. military was concerned that within 10 years, \u201cthere would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that\u2019s essentially Huawei, and then the American carriers would have no choice. They would just have to buy Huawei (equipment).\u201d  Huawei has been forging closer commercial ties with big telecom operators across Europe and Asia, putting it in prime position to lead the global race for 5G networks despite U.S. concerns.  Huawei has a dominant position in China, which is set to become the world\u2019s biggest 5G market by far, and has also made inroads in the rest of world to compete with rivals such as Ericsson ERICb.ST and Nokia NOKIA.HE in several lucrative markets, including countries that are longstanding U.S. allies.  Qualcomm is also a major player in 5G, estimated to have 15 percent of 5G-essential patents in the world, compared with 11 percent for Nokia and 10 percent for all of China, according to a Jefferies report citing LexInnova research. Many smartphone makers are counting on Qualcomm to deliver its 5G chipset on time in late 2018 to roll out their 5G phones in 2019.  Shares of Broadcom rose less than 1.0 percent to $264.10 in after-hours trade while Qualcomm fell 4.3 percent to $60.14.  Broadcom said it was reviewing the presidential order. \u201cBroadcom strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns,\u201d it said in a statement in response to the decision.  Qualcomm, which had delayed its annual shareholder meeting during the CFIUS review, set the new date for March 23.  The move by Trump to kill the deal comes only months after the U.S. president himself stood next to Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan at the White House, announcing the company\u2019s decision to move its headquarters to the United States and calling it \u201cone of the really great, great companies.\u201d  Slideshow ( 4 images )  This is the fifth time a U.S. president has blocked a deal based on CFIUS objections and the second deal Trump has stopped since assuming office slightly over a year ago.  \u201cThe proposed takeover of Qualcomm by the Purchaser (Broadcom) is prohibited, and any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover, whether effected directly or indirectly, is also prohibited,\u201d the presidential order released on Monday said.  The order cited \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that led Trump to believe that Broadcom\u2019s taking control of Qualcomm \u201cmight take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\u201d  BROADCOM\u2019S NEXT MOVE  Broadcom had struggled to complete its proposed deal to buy Qualcomm, which had cited several concerns including the price offered and potential antitrust hurdles.  The presidential decision to block the deal cannot be appealed. However, it is not clear what rules Broadcom would have to follow if it goes ahead with announced plans to move its headquarters to the United States.  Companies may challenge CFIUS\u2019s jurisdiction in court but may not challenge the inter-agency panel\u2019s national security findings, a CFIUS expert said.  If Broadcom decides to press on with its effort to buy Qualcomm, it would be wise to drop the matter for now while the company quietly wraps up its move to the United States, a second CFIUS expert said. Once the move is done, Broadcom could argue that CFIUS does not have jurisdiction, the second expert said.  Both spoke privately to protect business relationships.","311":"* Qualcomm proposes further price talks with Broadcom  * Focus on Fed chief\u2019s testimony, inflation data this week  * Futures up: Dow 143 pts, S&P 10 pts, Nasdaq 27 pts (Adds comment, details, updates prices)  Feb 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures pointed to a strong start for Wall Street on Monday, with investors hoping that new Fed chair Jerome Powell will keep the U.S. central bank on a steady course of monetary tightening.  Powell faces questions from both houses of the U.S. Congress in a semi-annual testimony starting on Tuesday, his first major set piece since he took over from Janet Yellen earlier this month.  His testimony comes at a time when investors have been anxious about the pace of interest rate hikes, which have weighed on equity markets globally.  \u201cThere\u2019s some talk of him (Powell) being a little more open to tolerating inflation running above the 2 percent target. The focus will be to see if he is indeed open to that and the rationale behind it,\u201d said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management.  The Fed said on Friday it expected economic growth to remain steady and saw no serious risks on the horizon that might pause its planned pace of rate hikes.

The court also confirmed some remedies proposed by the KFTC, including an order for Qualcomm to stop discriminating against rivals who sought to use its essential mobile patent and develop competing modem chips to supply smartphone makers.  The court however dismissed the regulator\u2019s claims that Qualcomm had disadvantaged smartphone makers by signing \u201ccomprehensive\u201d licensing deals, opening the door for the company to continue taking a cut of the price of the phone as a licence fee.  \u201cWe disagree with the court\u2019s decision to accept parts of the KFTC order and will immediately seek to appeal those provisions to the Korea Supreme Court,\u201d Qualcomm Executive Vice President Don Rosenberg said in a statement.  Qualcomm said it was \u201cgratified\u201d the court had reversed the KFTC\u2019s order to renegotiate the licensing terms.  The regulator declined to comment on whether it would lodge an appeal of its own.  Qualcomm is the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips and derives most of its profit from a business segment that invents technologies and licenses them.  The company forecast between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in revenue for that segment for its fiscal first quarter, above analyst expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Qualcomm's chips are essential components in many mobile devices and it is a top supplier to South Korean smartphone makers Samsung Electronics 005930.KS and LG Electronics 066570.KS, as well as Apple Inc AAPL.O.  In a sign it retained its strong market position even after the KFTC ruling, Qualcomm has since extended its strategic relationship with global smartphone leader Samsung and in August entered into a new five-year patent licence agreement with LG.  \u201cThis ruling will not really affect or weaken Qualcomm\u2019s status in the market, because we are heading into the 5G era and Qualcomm is one of a very few companies that can manufacture 5G modem chips,\u201d said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment and Securities.  \u201cHandset makers and telecom companies will still have to heavily rely on Qualcomm\u2019s products regardless of its supposedly unfair business practice.\u201d","314":"FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is pictured at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Shanghai, China June 28, 2019.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  In a filing in federal court in San Jose, California, Qualcomm said that it believes it can succeed in appealing the May 21 decision by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in an antitrust case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in January 2017. The company has not yet filed that appeal; Tuesday\u2019s filing only concerns whether the ruling\u2019s provisions will be put on hold temporarily as it plays out.  Qualcomm argued that Koh\u2019s ruling raised \u201cserious legal questions\u201d because, among other things, she excluded evidence after a March 2018 cutoff date - including the fact that Apple Inc dropped Qualcomm in favor of rival chip supplier Intel Corp, showing that Qualcomm did not have a stranglehold on the market. Qualcomm also said that the FTC\u2019s theory in the lawsuit - that Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices amounted to a \u201ctax\u201d on smart phone makers, generating profits that Qualcomm then put to work undercutting its rivals - was unprecedented in antitrust law.  Qualcomm said Koh\u2019s ruling would force it to rework its license deals and even offer deals to rival chip suppliers, scrambling its business in a way that would be impossible to unwind if it wins on appeal. Qualcomm shares shot up 23% in April when it resolved a legal conflict with Apple but then declined 15% after Koh\u2019s ruling.  \u201cAfter radically restructuring its business relationships, Qualcomm will not be able to return to its pre-injunction business in an orderly fashion,\u201d the company said. \u201cNor will it be able to unwind licensing agreements it has renegotiated in the shadow of an order that is later overturned.\u201d  FTC officials did not immediately return a request for comment. Hours before the filing, FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, wrote a commentary in the Wall Street Journal calling Koh\u2019s ruling \u201calarming\u201d and calling for it to be revisited.  \u201cSpeaking for myself, and not for the FTC or any other commissioner, I encourage higher courts to reconsider the wisdom of the judge\u2019s conclusions,\u201d Wilson wrote. \u201cIn the interim, I write to make clear to businesses, fellow antitrust enforcers abroad, and law students my opinion that this ruling is both bad law and bad policy.\u201d  San Diego-based Qualcomm makes cellphone processors and modem chips, but generates most of its profit by licensing its technology to mobile phone makers.  Koh ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices had \u201cstrangled competition\u201d and directed the company to renegotiate licensing agreements with customers at fair prices without threatening to cut off supplies.  She also ruled that Qualcomm must offer to license its patents on fair terms to rival chipmakers such as MediaTek Inc. Qualcomm currently licenses its patents to device makers. Shifting to licensing to other chip suppliers could reduce Qualcomm\u2019s royalties from as much as $20 per phone to just a few dollars per device.  The judge also said Qualcomm could not enter exclusivity agreements that block rivals from selling chips to smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Koh required Qualcomm to be monitored for seven years to ensure it complied with her remedies.  If Koh reject\u2019s Qualcomm\u2019s request to put the ruling on hold during the appeals process, Qualcomm will then ask the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to do the same. The company\u2019s appeal on the legal merits of the ruling will proceed even if it loses its request to put its provisions on hold as the process plays out.  Qualcomm had argued during a 10-day non-jury trial before Koh in January that it became dominant in the market for smartphone chips through technological leadership, not freezing out rivals.","318":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Apple Inc asked for $1 billion as an \u201cincentive payment\u201d from Qualcomm Inc in order for Qualcomm to become the supplier of modem chips for Apple\u2019s iPhone, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive testified on Friday at a trial with U.S. antitrust regulators.

While such a payment is common in the industry, the size of it was not, Mollenkopf said.  Under the 2011 deal, Qualcomm was named Apple\u2019s sole supplier of modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data networks, in exchange for which Qualcomm agreed to give Apple a rebate - the exact nature of which has not been disclosed. Apple could choose another supplier but it would lose the rebate, effectively increasing the cost of its chips.  Antitrust regulators have argued the deal with Apple was part of a pattern of anticompetitive conduct by Qualcomm to preserve its dominance in modem chips and exclude players like Intel.  At a federal courthouse in San Jose, California, Mollenkopf testified that Apple demanded the $1 billion without any assurance of how many chips it would buy, which pushed the chip supplier to pursue an exclusivity arrangement in order to ensure it sold enough chips to recover the payment.  Qualcomm was not aiming to block rivals like Intel, he said.  \u201cThe risk was, what would the volume be? Would we get everything we wanted, given that we paid so much in incentive?\u201d Mollenkopf testified.

The company stopped trying to place an Intel modem chip in the iPad Mini 2 because losing the rebates on Qualcomm\u2019s chips would have made the overall cost too high, he said.  \u201cThey made it very unattractive for us to use another chip supplier,\u201d Blevins said of the rebates. \u201cThese rebates were very, very large.\u201d","322":"March 15 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc:  * RECENTLY DEMOTED CHAIRMAN OF QUALCOMM PAUL JACOBS APPROACHED SEVERAL GLOBAL INVESTORS IN EFFORT TO ACQUIRE QUALCOMM - FT, CITING SOURCES Source text: on.ft.com\/2pgZZKN Further company coverage:","323":"May 22 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc illegally suppressed competition in the market for smartphone chips by threatening to cut off supplies and extracting excessive licensing fees, a U.S. judge ruled, a decision that could force the company to overhaul its business practices.

The foray by Shenzhen-based OnePlus comes after U.S. mobile carriers AT&T and Verizon this year backed away from plans to work with China\u2019s Huawei on high-end phones in face of pressure from the U.S. government, which considers Huawei a security risk..  But the OnePlus alliance, to be announced today in New York, shows how many U.S.-China business relationships, including those involving the most advanced technologies, are marching ahead despite the U.S. China trade war. OnePlus has quietly become the No. 3 client for Qualcomm\u2019s most expensive mobile phone chips, behind Samsung and LG Electronics, according to data from market researcher Canalys.  Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon last week introduced 29-year-old OnePlus founder Carl Pei to centre stage at its annual partners\u2019 summit in Hong Kong, where Pei told the audience his company would be among the first to a launch a phone fit for fifth-generation (5G) mobile technology using Qualcomm chips.  In an interview, Pei declined to comment on specifics of U.S. carrier relationships. But T-Mobile executives will be part of the Monday event and sources said the company would sell OnePlus phones. Such carrier partnerships are critical to making an impact in the U.S. smartphone market.  \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is a good time for anybody else,\u201d Pei said of the prospect of entering the U.S. carrier-bundled phone market - the dominant channel for sales there. \u201cIt is a good time for us.\u201d  The phone to be unveiled Monday, called the 6T, will sell for a price above $500 but packs features that are typically present only in pricier handsets. Xiaomi, a Chinese rival that also focuses on feature-packed phones at bargain prices, has said it plans to launch in the U.S. next year, but did not respond to a request for comment on whether those plans are still in place.  OnePlus is unusual among Chinese tech companies, which typically focus on mass-market products for domestic customers. OnePlus, by contrast, only sells premium phones that cost $400 or more, almost exclusively online except in India, and derives two-thirds of its revenue from outside China.  It has become the top seller of premium smartphones in India with a 40 percent market share, a price-sensitive market where top-of-the-line phones from Apple and Samsung have gained little traction, according to data from Counterpoint.  Globally, in the above-$400 phone category, Apple dominates with 43 percent of the market, followed by Samsung (24 percent), OPPO (10 percent), Huawei (9 percent), Xiaomi (3 percent) and OnePlus (2 percent), Counterpoint said.  Within the company of about 1,000 employees, fewer than 100 are dedicated to sales while more than half are in product research and development, according to Pei.  OnePlus is affiliated with OPPO, a Chinese smartphone-maker and a major force in mid-end phones, which are sold globally and cost about $300. Canalys analyst Mo Jia said that relationship was critical in helping OnePlus keep its costs low.  Pei said OnePlus shares procurement channels and supply chain with OPPO, which allow it to manufacture in China and India at lower costs than others.  According to Chinese company registration records, the two companies have common shareholders, including the retired Chinese electronics magnate Duan Yongping, who also has ownership in Vivo, another major Chinese smartphone vendor. Both OPPO and Vivo are know for aggressive offline marketing and massive sales channels that reach small town customers in China, India and other developing markets.  QUALCOMM\u2019S QUANDRY  Qualcomm is eager to back OnePlus as it seeks to maintain its lead in the premium mobile chip market.  \u201cMost premium smartphone players, including Apple, Samsung and Huawei, have their own silicon now and are largely using that for their higher-end smartphones,\u201d said IDC senior research manager Kiranjeet Kaur.  Qualcomm, which pioneered key mobile technologies, is locked in a bitter royalty dispute with Apple, which increasingly designs its own processors.  Huawei, which replaced Apple as the second-largest smartphone maker in the world behind Samsung in the second quarter, sells high-end phones with its own Kirin chipsets, while some lower-end models use Qualcomm chips.  Even though Huawei said it had no plan to sell its chips to outsiders, the company is increasingly moving from being a customer to a competitor to Qualcomm as the telecom industry moves to 5G technology.  Qualcomm president Amon described the delicate situation as \u201ca relationship of co-opetition\u201d at the summit last week.  OnePlus, which claims to have sent the world\u2019s first 5G tweet in a test on Friday, said it will launch a 5G phone next year.  Pei shrugged off any concerns that U.S. consumer sentiment would be affected by the China-US trade conflict. \u201cAt the end of the day, all you can control is your own.\u201d  Pei, who was born in China and raised in Sweden, said the brand is cross-cultural and international: \u201cWhen we started, we saw that through social media, you can talk to everyone around the world, as long as you can speak their language.\u201d","325":"Feb 9 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc said on Friday that it might lose two major customers if the revised $121 billion deal with chipmaker Broadcom Ltd goes forward.  \"Two customers providing Qualcomm chipset revenues in excess of $1 billion each per year have stated that they are likely to move designs away from Qualcomm in the event that this transaction moves forward,\" according to a filing.

Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK and Oppo said they will use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 chip in devices they plan to launch in the first quarter of next year. The companies planned to announce the news at a Qualcomm conference being held in Hawaii.  Xiaomi and Oppo, both based in China, were the fourth and fifth biggest smartphone sellers in the world in the third quarter, according to research firm IDC. They have also become major Qualcomm customers, with both Xiaomi and Oppo's parent group each accounting for more than 10% of Qualcomm's $24.2 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. Qualcomm's other major customers are Apple Inc AAPL.O and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS.  Qualcomm planned to disclose the full details of its newest mobile phone processors at the event in Hawaii. The chip will include features for artificial intelligence tasks such as identifying objects in photos stored on smartphones, as well as a modem for connecting to 5G networks, which are rolling out this year and next and are expected to be much faster than current 4G networks.  Qualcomm also said that its Snapdragon 765 chip, which is priced lower than its 865 chip and is often found in midpriced handsets, will include 5G connectivity in an effort to popularize the technology on lower-priced phones.  In addition to selling the computing chips and modems for mobile phones, Qualcomm has also been trying to persuade phone makers to use more of its other components, such as antenna chips for connecting to 5G networks. To further that effort, Qualcomm on Tuesday announced it would start selling \u201cmodules\u201d containing a number of different chips to phone makers.  The modules are intended to reduce the amount of time it takes phone brands to design a new device because Qualcomm will have already performed much of the engineering work and testing.  Qualcomm also said that it had worked with Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N and Vodafone Group VOD.L to certify that the modules will work on their carrier networks. Testing phones to ensure they will work on different carrier networks is one of the costliest and most time-consuming elements of bringing new phones to market, and Qualcomm said it is hoping to cut down on the time and expense involved for phone makers that use its chips.","327":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  LONDON (Reuters) - US chipmaker Broadcom AVGO.O has agreed record-breaking syndicated loans of up to $100 billion with 12 banks to finance its proposed $121 billion acquisition of Qualcomm QCOM.O, the company said on Monday.

Qualcomm made the accusations in a motion to amend a complaint that was originally filed in November, when it alleged that Apple had broken a software license contract by sharing confidential details about Qualcomm\u2019s chips with Intel engineers. The Tuesday allegations were made in a planned legal filing seen by Reuters.  They go further than the original complaint by alleging Apple stole Qualcomm trade secrets in a \u201cmulti-year campaign of sloppy, inappropriate and deceitful conduct ... for the purpose of improving lower-quality modem chipsets, including those manufactured by Intel, a competitor of Qualcomm, to render such chipsets useable in Apple devices with the ultimate goal of diverting Qualcomm\u2019s Apple-based business to Intel.\u201d  Intel is not named as a defendant in Qualcomm\u2019s lawsuit.  The San Diego County lawsuit is unfolding amid a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  Qualcomm provided modem chips for the iPhone, which helped the device connect to wireless data networks. Starting with the iPhone 7, Apple began using Intel modem chips in some of its models.  Qualcomm has told investors in July that it believes its modem chips have been completely removed from the newest generation of iPhones, which were released this month, leaving Intel as the sole supplier. Tear downs of the new devices have so far confirmed that Intel is supplying modem chips.  But during the years when Apple used Qualcomm modems, Qualcomm provided Apple access to its confidential software tools to help Apple integrate the modems into the iPhone, Qualcomm\u2019s suit alleges. Qualcomm on Tuesday alleged that, since the start of its lawsuit in November, it has discovered evidence that Apple engineers \u201crepeatedly\u201d used Qualcomm software to help Intel\u2019s engineers to \u201cimprove the sub-par performance of Intel\u2019s chipsets.\u201d  \u201cIn fact, it apparently improved Intel chipsets to the point where Apple decided to divert some of Qualcomm\u2019s Apple-based business to Intel,\u201d Qualcomm wrote in its filing.  Qualcomm in its filing asked Judge Jacqueline M. Stern to allow it to attach the new allegations to its existing complaint rather than force it to file a new lawsuit. (Reporting by Stephen Nellis Editing by Stephen Coates)","331":"Dec 13 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday ruled that evidence provided by chip supplier Qualcomm Inc that major phone makers like Apple Inc have moved to competing suppliers like Intel Corp cannot be used to fight allegations Qualcomm acted to preserve a monopoly on some mobile phone chips.  The Federal Trade Commission\u2019s lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleges that Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing and chip sale practices were anticompetitive and sought to preserve a monopoly on so-called premium LTE modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data network.  The case, which began in 2017, is headed to trial in January, but the cutoff for the two sides to gather evidence ended in March.  Since March, Qualcomm has disclosed that Apple completely stopped using its modems in its newest iPhones and switched to chips from Intel Corp. Qualcomm has also broadened its use of a lower-cost licensing model for technology for the next generation of mobile data networks, with several phone makers already signing the deals.  Qualcomm argued in court papers that the new market conditions would likely show that it does not have the monopoly on modem chips that the FTC alleges.  But Judge Lucy Koh rejected the request in a pre-trial decision, saying that the case was about Qualcomm\u2019s business conduct and not its market power.  \u201cQualcomm does not argue that any post-discovery evidence shows a change in Qualcomm\u2019s own business conduct. All of the proposed evidence relates to alleged shifts in Qualcomm\u2019s market power,\u201d Koh wrote in her decision.  The decision is the second pre-trial blow Judge Koh has dealt to Qualcomm. Last month, she ruled that Qualcomm must grant patent licenses to its technology to rival chipmakers if they request it.

Qualcomm forecast total revenue of between $4.4 billion and $5.2 billion for its third quarter. Analysts had estimated revenue of $4.89 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  However, the company's outlook was in contrast to many other chipmakers, including Intel Corp INTC.O and Texas Instrument Inc TXN.O, who have either withdrawn or cut their revenue forecasts, citing the impact of the virus on demand and supply channels.  Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of modem chips that connect mobile phones and other devices to data networks, said coronavirus reduced demand for handsets by about 21% in the second quarter from a year earlier, and forecast 30% reduction in handset shipment in the current quarter.  Fall in device sales means less profit and revenue for Qualcomm, as it makes most of its profit from licensing its technologies that allow phones to connect to wireless data networks.  The company, however, sold chips at an average price of $31.8 compared with their earlier price of $23 - a sign that it is benefiting from a rise in demand for high-end chips.  Qualcomm\u2019s second-quarter revenue from its licensing business stood at $1.07 billion, above estimates of $1.01 billion, according to FactSet.

The alleged patent violation stemmed not from Intel chips but yet another Apple supplier - Qorvo Inc - whose chip was only present in older phones with Intel modems.  The court sided with Qualcomm and banned sales of some iPhone models that used Intel modem chips, leading Apple to pull the devices from its 15 retail stories in Germany and its online store in the country.  The ban was a victory in Qualcomm\u2019s legal conflict with Apple.

FILE PHOTO: A chef walks past an Apple store in Beijing, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Thomas Peter  Between 2011 and 2016, Apple relied on San Diego-based Qualcomm as the sole supplier of such chips, which help iPhones connect to wireless networks. Starting in 2016, Apple split the business between Intel and Qualcomm, but in 2018, Apple moved solely to Intel for its newest phones.  But Apple supply chain executive Tony Blevins testified on Friday that Apple has also considered MediaTek and Samsung, one of its largest rivals in the smart phone market, to supply the chips for the next generation of wireless networks known as 5G. Those networks are expected to start rolling out this year and provide faster data speeds than current 4G networks.  The FTC is suing Qualcomm alleging the chip supplier engaged in anticompetitive patent licensing practices to preserve a dominant position in the premium modem chip market.  On the stand at a federal courthouse in San Jose, California, Blevins testified that Apple has long sought multiple suppliers for modem chips but signed an agreement with Qualcomm to exclusively supply the chips because the chip supplier offered deep rebates on patent license costs in exchange for exclusivity.  In 2013, Apple broke off work with Intel to start supplying modems for the iPad Mini 2 because Apple would lose its rebates by using Intel\u2019s chips, rendering Intel\u2019s products \u201ceconomically unattractive\u201d overall.  Later that year after cost negotiations with Qualcomm did not go as Apple hoped, Apple kicked off \u201cProject Antique\u201d to secure a second modem supplier, Blevins testified.  By 2016 and 2017, Apple introduced Intel\u2019s modems in some of its iPhones but also still used Qualcomm chips. But Apple\u2019s lawsuit against Qualcomm filed in early 2017 caused their business relationship to change \u201cin a very profound and negative manner,\u201d leading to using only Intel\u2019s modems for the phones released last year.  \u201cThe entire concept of Project Antique was to find a second supplier. No offense to (Intel) but we don\u2019t want to be single supplier with them. We wanted both Qualcomm and (Intel) in the mix,\u201d Blevins said. Blevins also testified Apple considered making Intel the sole supplier of modems for the Apple Watch, which added 4G connectivity in 2017 using Qualcomm chips.  Blevins said that talking with Samsung, whose Galaxy and Note devices compete against the iPhone, is \u201cnot an ideal environment\u201d for Apple, but that Samsung is currently the largest component supplier to Apple.  Blevins did not say whether Apple had reached a decision on a 5G modem supplier or whether it would release a 5G iPhone in 2019. Citing sources, Bloomberg previously reported that Apple would not release such a phone until 2020.","345":"Dec 3 (Reuters) - U.S. smartphone chip manufacturer Qualcomm Inc considers the prospect of an acquisition of NXP Semiconductors as closed, the company said on Monday.  \u201cWhile we were grateful to learn of President Trump and President Xi\u2019s comments about Qualcomm\u2019s previously proposed acquisition of NXP, the deadline for that transaction has expired, which terminated the contemplated deal,\u201d a Qualcomm representative said via email. \u201cQualcomm considers the matter closed.\u201d  China was \u201copen to approving the previously unapproved\u201d deal for Qualcomm to acquire NXP \u201cshould it again be presented,\u201d the White House said in a statement over the weekend after a meeting between Chinese and U.S. leaders.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Qualcomm is seen during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 27, 2018. REUTERS\/Yves Herman  The Korean company said that it is negotiating chip supply and patent license agreements with Qualcomm and could be forced into signing another unfair deal unless a federal judge\u2019s protections remain in place.  The filing in federal court in San Jose, California, came shortly after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission also opposed Qualcomm\u2019s efforts, saying that it was in the public interest to let the antitrust ruling stand because an appeal could take years.  Both filings stem from a May 21 decision by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh that would drastically alter the business model of Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips to connect phones to mobile data networks but makes most of its profit through licensing patents.  Among other things, Koh\u2019s decision would require Qualcomm to license its patents to rival chip makers instead of phone makers, which could potentially slice its patent royalties from several dollars per phone to pennies.  Qualcomm on May 28 asked Koh to set aside her decision while it pursues an appeal. The company said that Koh\u2019s decision would entail \u201cradically restructuring its business relationships\u201d in ways that would be impossible to reverse if it wins an appeal.  It also argued that Koh\u2019s ruling raised \u201cserious legal questions\u201d because, among other things, Koh blocked market evidence showing that Apple Inc dropped Qualcomm in favor of rival chip supplier Intel Corp.  In a court filing on Tuesday, JongSang Lee, LG Electronics\u2019 general counsel, said that the phone maker relies on Qualcomm for modem chips and is in the midst of negotiating a new agreement, including over 5G chips for the newest generation of mobile networks in Korea.  Lee wrote that Qualcomm has continued to pressure LG Electronics to sign a patent license in order to keep its access to Qualcomm chips, which it relies on for its phones. LG Electronics\u2019 agreement with Qualcomm runs out on June 30, and the phone maker may have \u201cno option but to conclude license and chipset supply agreements once again on Qualcomm\u2019s terms, since LGE must rely on Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips,\u201d Lee wrote.  Koh\u2019s decision \u201cprohibits Qualcomm\u2019s long-standing \u2018no license no chip\u2019 position, which Qualcomm has continuously raised during its license negotiations with LGE,\u201d Lee wrote. \u201cWithout this order, LGE will continue to face Qualcomm\u2019s anticompetitive stance during currently ongoing negotiations.\u201d  The FTC similarly argued that Koh\u2019s ruling should stay in place while Qualcomm appeals, saying that a prompt enforcement of the Court\u2019s order is in the public interest.  \u201cThe appellate process could easily extend through the initial rollout of 5G technology ... and a stay would allow Qualcomm time to use anticompetitive practices to entrench its monopoly power in modem-chip markets during this critical period,\u201d the FTC wrote in its filing.  The App Association, a group that represents more than 5,000 app developers and device makers and is backed by sponsor Apple, also said it planned to oppose Qualcomm\u2019s request, saying it would hurt smaller device makers.  \u201cAllowing Qualcomm to continue abusing its (patents) and its wireless chipset monopoly any longer will irreparably harm opportunities for small businesses in the app and internet of things marketplace and would encourage further abusive behavior in (patent) licensing widely,\u201d said App Association President Morgan Reed.  In April, Apple signed a six-year patent license agreement with Qualcomm and a multi-year chip supply deal. As part of the deal, Apple dropped all litigation against Qualcomm, and the company did not return a comment request asking if it would also oppose Qualcomm\u2019s efforts to pause the antitrust ruling.  Qualcomm has signaled its intention to file an appeal but has not yet filed one or fully revealed its legal arguments. Tuesday\u2019s filing by the FTC only concerns whether the ruling\u2019s provisions will be put on hold temporarily as any appeal plays out.","348":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Qualcomm QCOM.O, the world's no.1 chipmaker, was fined 242 million euros ($272 million) by the European Commission on Thursday for blocking a rival from the market about a decade ago, its second EU antitrust penalty.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The European Commission, the EU's competition regulator, accused Qualcomm of predatory pricing between 2009 and 2011 aimed at forcing out British phone software maker Icera, now part of Nvidia Corp NVDA.O.  \u201cQualcomm\u2019s strategic behavior prevented competition and innovation in the market,\u201d Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.  In a news conference, she later defended the time it had taken to reach a decision - the Commission first accused the company of predatory pricing in 2015 - saying it had been a complex case that depended on evidence from Qualcomm.  The fine amounts to 1.27% of Qualcomm\u2019s turnover in 2018.  Qualcomm said it would appeal the decision, saying it was \u201cunsupported by the law, economic principles or market facts.\u201d  The Commission also fined Qualcomm 997 million euros ($1.1 billion) last year for paying iPhone maker Apple AAPL.O to use only its chips, a tactic aimed at thwarting rivals including Intel INTC.O.  The Commission is investigating another U.S. chipmaker, Broadcom AVGO.O, over whether it hampers rivals. Vestager said the Commission may impose so-called interim measures, which are typically warnings to change behavior, in early autumn.  Qualcomm has been targeted by other enforcers for its business practices. In May, it lost an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission, with the judge issuing a sweeping antitrust ruling against the company.  Hefty fines, in particular against U.S. tech giants, have been a hallmark of Vestager\u2019s five-year run as Europe\u2019s antitrust enforcer, a policy which has earned her the ire of U.S President Donald Trump.  Vestager said she hoped to remain in the post when a new Commission takes office in November, but did not rule out another role. Her term ends on Oct. 31.","349":"BEIJING\/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Qualcomm\u2019s proposed $44 billion takeover of rival NXP Semiconductors is yet to see a concrete breakthrough in China, sources said, tempering hopes a lull in trade tensions with the United States had prompted Beijing to speed up its ruling on the deal.  FILE PHOTO: A booth of U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm is pictured at an expo in Beijing, China, September 27, 2017. Picture taken September 27, 2017. REUTERS\/Stringer\/File Photo  China\u2019s approval would likely depend on the progress of broader trade discussions, three people with knowledge of the deal said, as senior Chinese and U.S. officials meet this week in Washington for their second round of high-stake talks.  They made little apparent progress in discussions in Beijing earlier this month. The U.S. ambassador to China said on Tuesday the two countries were still \u201cvery far apart\u201d on resolving trade frictions.  Washington and Beijing have proposed tens of billions of dollars in tariffs in recent weeks, fanning worries of a full-blown trade war that could hurt global supply chains and dent business investment plans.  Qualcomm\u2019s takeover of NXP has been caught in the crosshairs of the trade tensions. The deal has received approval from eight of the nine required global regulators, with Chinese clearance the only one pending.  NXP shares jumped on Monday after a media report said China had resumed its review of the deal and that the commerce ministry had been asked to speed up the process.  This followed President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge on Sunday to help China\u2019s ZTE Corp get \u201cback into business\u201d after a U.S. ban hurt the telecom equipment maker, signaling a thaw in trade relations.  However, two sources told Reuters there had been no outward change in the review process that has been ongoing since Qualcomm refiled its application for the deal in April.  There has been no clear new signs since Sunday pointing to an imminent approval of the deal, one of the sources said.  The second source, who is familiar with Qualcomm\u2019s dealings with Chinese regulators, said the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) had not provided the company with any updates on the review.  The Ministry of Commerce and SAMR did not have an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday. Qualcomm did not respond to requests for comment.  BROADER TALKS IN FOCUS  China is unlikely to approve the deal while broader trade talks and discussion around ZTE are still in the balance, but it could quickly give the go-ahead at the \u201cright political moment\u201d, antitrust lawyers and people close to Qualcomm said.  \u201cBecause of the current trade tensions and the ZTE incident they are just waiting for the right timing to do it,\u201d said one Beijing-based antitrust lawyer, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak about the matter.  He added that Chinese regulators had already been looking at the case for a \u201cvery long time\u201d and had identified remedies that Qualcomm needed to implement to resolve competition issues and push the deal through.  \u201cFrom a procedural perspective, (the Chinese regulators) could clear the case even tomorrow or this week,\u201d he said.  Clinching the deal is key for Qualcomm, which is looking to diversify its customer base and become the leading chip supplier to the fast-growing automotive market.  The sharp change in Trump\u2019s stance on ZTE has fueled optimism about the prospects of the deal, sources said.  \u201cThis is the first positive indicator I\u2019ve seen for some time,\u201d said a third U.S.-based technology industry executive with knowledge of the deal.  \u201cFor suppliers to ZTE - including Qualcomm, Google, Intel and InterDigital - positive engagement is a good outcome.\u201d","350":"(Reuters) - Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O said on Monday it expects to redomicile to the United States by April 3, two days before the chipmaker's acquisition target Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O holds its annual shareholder meeting.

Broadcom said such security concerns were not a risk to the closure of the proposed buyout as it never planned to finish the deal before completing moving its official base to the United States.  Broadcom is incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.  Broadcom said last week that CFIUS has ordered the company to provide it with five business days\u2019 notice before taking any action toward moving base to the United States.  The requirement showed that CFIUS, an inter-agency panel led by the U.S. Treasury, was aware that its jurisdiction could be contested if Broadcom redomiciles to the United States.  CFIUS had delayed Qualcomm\u2019s annual meeting by a month to April 5. In that meeting, shareholders will also vote for Broadcom\u2019s slate of six nominees for Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board.

Shares in Qualcomm were down 0.5 percent to $76.73 after the ruling, which had been widely expected.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh did not give a specific reason for denying Qualcomm\u2019s motion but she did strike from the record several pieces of evidence that Qualcomm had tried to use to make its case, including a slide deck from internal Apple Inc documents that Qualcomm alleged was evidence of a coordinated effort inside the iPhone maker to harm Qualcomm financially. Government regulators had objected to including the slide deck, which would have become part of the official record for higher courts to review.  Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips to connect phones to wireless data networks, is fighting a May 21 decision by Koh in a case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Koh ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices had \u201cstrangled competition\u201d and directed the company to renegotiate licensing agreements with customers.  Among other things, the ruling would drastically alter Qualcomm\u2019s business model by forcing it to license its patents to rival chip makers instead of phone makers, which could potentially slice its patent royalties from several dollars per phone to pennies.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The company\u2019s shares, which closed up 23 percent on Tuesday after the announcement, rose as much as 17 percent on Wednesday, hitting their highest in nearly two decades.  The deal with Apple, coming at the cusp of the rollout of high-speed 5G network, could help Qualcomm return to the preeminent position it held in the early 2010s when it dominated the transition to 4G mobile networks and expanded revenues dramatically.  Qualcomm\u2019s fortunes are also looking up since Intel Corp, which had been Apple\u2019s sole iPhone chip supplier for the past year, decided to exit the modem chip business following Qualcomm\u2019s settlement with Apple.  \u201cIn the US, around 5G it\u2019s Qualcomm\u2019s world and everyone else is just paying rent,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.  \u201cThis was a game changing settlement for Qualcomm and was also a smart move by Apple to clear this noise and focus on 5G smartphones for 2020.\u201d  Wall Street analysts scrambled to raise their recommendations and price targets on Qualcomm\u2019s stock following the settlement.  At least three brokerages raised their ratings and nine ratcheted up their price targets.

Bond investors also joined in, with Qualcomm\u2019s 4.3 percent 2047 issuance becoming one of the most heavily traded bonds in the U.S. corporate space on Wednesday, according to capital markets publication IFR.  The company could make $2 billion annually by taking Intel\u2019s market share and regain the dominant position it enjoyed during the rollout of 4G, analysts said.  The settlement also helps Apple close the gap with rivals such as South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co and Huawei in delivering a 5G phone.  Both Apple and Huawei had been at odds with Qualcomm over patents and royalties over modems. While Qualcomm did not close the terms of the deal, analysts estimated that Apple withheld $5 billion, or about $2 per share, under its previous royalty payment agreement.  \u201cWe now expect an imminent settlement with Huawei which has also been withholding royalty payments, which we estimate will add another $0.50-$0.75 of EPS,\u201d Cowen and Company analysts said.

The Trump administration played an outsized role in Qualcomm's fate and there had been expectations that the lifting of a ban on U.S. chipmakers doing business with China's ZTE Corp 000063.SZ would clear the way for the NXP deal.  U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican who had been critical of ZTE, in a post on Twitter blasted China\u2019s action against Qualcomm, saying: \u201cWe should reimpose ZTE ban.\u201d  Qualcomm needed approval from China because the country accounted for nearly two-thirds of its revenue last year.  The Chinese Commerce Ministry declined on Thursday to comment on whether the deal was approved.  \u201cAccording to my understanding, the case was an anti-monopoly issue, and not related to China-U.S. trade friction,\u201d ministry spokesman Gao Feng said at a regular news conference.  He said that while China does not want a trade war, it is not afraid of one.  WHAT NEXT?  While the collapse of the deal will remove a big overhang from Qualcomm\u2019s stock, it will leave it on the hook to find new ways to turbocharge growth as global phone sales slow.  The company said on Wednesday that it expects Apple Inc AAPL.O to solely use modems from a rival - likely Intel Corp INTC.O - amid an acrimonious battle between the two companies over pricing and licensing costs.  But it cited progress on one of two major patent royalty conflicts, thought to be with Chinese phonemaker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. Of the $700 million due to Qualcomm as part of an interim agreement, $500 million was paid this quarter.

A spokesman for Huawei said the company would not comment on speculation.  \u201cWe think moving on, reducing the amount of uncertainty in the business and increasing the focus is the right thing to do with the company,\u201d Mollenkopf said.  For now, Qualcomm will buy back $30 billion in shares if the deal fails, making good on a promise to reassure investors. The San Diego chipmaker on Wednesday also delivered surprisingly strong third-quarter results and a rosy outlook for so-called 5G technology, the next generation of wireless data networks.  The company\u2019s shares rose about 7 percent in premarket trading, while those of NXP fell 6.5 percent.  Qualcomm will pay NXP $2 billion in termination fee by 09:00 ET on July 26, as agreed.  \u201cWe believe ending the uncertainty of buying NXP is positive for Qualcomm shares,\u201d Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley said in a note to clients.  He said he expects strong earnings growth over the next several years thanks to the share buyback, the likelihood that the disputes with Apple and Huawei will be settled over the next year, and that 5G will drive market share gains.","364":"May 21 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc:  * QUALCOMM AND FACEBOOK TO BRING HIGH-SPEED INTERNET CONNECTIVITY OVER 60GHZ TO URBAN AREAS  * QUALCOMM INC - QUALCOMM TECHNOLOGIES WILL INTEGRATE ITS QCA6438 AND QCA6428 FAMILY OF PRE-802.11AY CHIPSETS WITH FACEBOOK\u2019S TERRAGRAPH TECHNOLOGY  * QUALCOMM INC - CO AND FACEBOOK EXPECT TO BEGIN TRIALS OF INTEGRATED SOLUTION MID-2019 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","365":"FILE PHOTO: A sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd, is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017.

Apple and Qualcomm are involved in a series legal actions. Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest mobile phone chip supplier, has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  Qualcomm made its comments about the size of Apple\u2019s unpaid royalties in a hearing in one of the cases in federal court in San Diego. Apple has disputed the amount of royalties that it owes to Qualcomm.  Apple has argued that Qualcomm is forcing it to pay for the same patents twice, once when Apple uses Qualcomm\u2019s chip in iPhones and then again through patent royalties. Qualcomm has argued that its practices are legal and that Apple is seeking to destroy Qualcomm\u2019s business model after agreeing to it for years.","367":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O is not in talks \"at any level\" to settle its wide-ranging legal dispute with mobile chip maker Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, according to a source familiar with the matter.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  In the past, Apple used Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips in its flagship iPhone models to help them connect to wireless data networks. But early last year, Apple sued Qualcomm in federal court in San Diego, alleging that the chip company\u2019s practice of taking a cut of the selling price of phones as a patent license fee was illegal.  Qualcomm denied the claims and has alleged that Apple owes it $7 billion in unpaid royalties.  A source familiar with the situation said this week that there are no settlement talks between Apple and Qualcomm.  \u201cThere is absolutely no meaningful discussion taking place between us and Qualcomm, and there is no settlement in sight,\u201d the person said. \u201cWe are gearing up for trial.\u201d  Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The case is to go to trial early next year and has spawned related legal actions in other courts around the world. In July, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, told investors on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call that the two companies were in talks to resolve the litigation.  \u201cWe continue to talk. We also have a number of ... legal strategies that are in flight,\u201d Mollenkopf said on the call. \u201cAnd we hope that through the combination of either those paths, we could get to a resolution, and we\u2019re confident that we will.\u201d  In addition to its dispute with Apple, Qualcomm is in a dispute with another phone maker, widely believed by analysts to be China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, that is withholding payments. But talks with Huawei appear to be progressing.  In July, Qualcomm received what its patent licensing chief, Alex Rogers, called a \u201cgood faith partial payment\u201d of $500 million from the non-paying phone maker, which Qualcomm executives said was a sign of progress in the talks. Qualcomm is slated to receive $200 million more in such payments, the executives have said.  Qualcomm is also trying to settle an antitrust lawsuit brought against it by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission days before Apple filed its lawsuit.  But that effort suffered a setback on Tuesday, when a federal judge in San Jose, California, issued a preliminary ruling saying that Qualcomm must license some patents involved in making modem chips to rivals such as Intel Corp INTC.O, a move that could jeopardize Qualcomm's existing licensing practices.","368":"FILE PHOTO: Qualcomm's logo is seen at its booth at the Global Mobile Internet Conference (GMIC) 2015 in Beijing, China, April 28, 2015.

Qualcomm can face a fine up to 10 percent of its worldwide turnover if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules. It was hit with a 997-million-euro ($1.2 billion) penalty in January this year for paying Apple AAPL.O to use only its chips in a bid to squeeze out rival Intel Corp INTC.O and others.","369":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc said on Wednesday it met with Broadcom Ltd earlier in the day to discuss the latter\u2019s revised $121 billion bid, the first time the chipmakers have discussed what would be the technology sector\u2019s largest ever acquisition.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The outcome of the meeting will determine whether Qualcomm, which has resisted Broadcom\u2019s takeover approach since November, will engage in negotiations or continue to defend itself by rallying its shareholders, who are scheduled to vote on March 6 on replacing the majority of its board with Broadcom nominees.  Neither side commented on what transpired in the two-hour meeting. Qualcomm said in its statement its board would meet to determine its next steps.  Broadcom\u2019s top executives left the meeting with the impression that their Qualcomm counterparts listened to them but did not engage, according to sources familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because it was private.  The meeting came after Qualcomm rejected Broadcom\u2019s revised cash-and-stock bid of $82 per share last week and said the new offer still undervalued it and fell well short of the firm commitments on regulatory issues it expected.  Qualcomm had said it would take the meeting to allow Broadcom to explain how it would attempt to bridge the gaps in both value and deal certainty and to better understand the issues that remained unaddressed in its proposal.  Qualcomm said last week that Broadcom\u2019s plan to address antitrust concerns by selling two Qualcomm businesses, its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones, was inadequate to allay concerns that the deal would not win regulatory approval.  The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices.  Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily outsources the manufacturing of its chips which are used for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  Qualcomm has argued that signing a deal with Broadcom could create uncertainty with its customers during the time it takes to complete the deal. Broadcom has promised to pay a breakup fee of $8 billion in the event regulators thwart the deal, as well as a \u201cticking\u201d fee of 6 percent per year on the cash portion of the consideration if the deal takes more than 12 months to close.","370":"(Corrects spelling of customers in headline)  Feb 9 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc :  * QUALCOMM - TWO CUSTOMERS PROVIDING CHIPSET REVENUE OF OVER $1 BILLION EACH PER YEAR STATED THEY ARE LIKELY TO MOVE DESIGNS AWAY FROM CO IF DEAL WITH BROADCOM MOVES FORWARD  * QUALCOMM - \u201cWE BELIEVE BROADCOM\u2019S STRATEGY IS MAINLY TO TRADE LICENSING REVENUE FOR CHIP SHARE AT HIGHER PRICES\u201d  * QUALCOMM - ANY POSSIBLE DEAL APPROVAL WOULD REQUIRE \u201cSIGNIFICANT AND COMPLEX DIVESTITURES\u201d AS WELL AS RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMBINED ENTITY\u2019S FUTURE OPERATIONS  * QUALCOMM INC - PROPOSED BROADCOM-QUALCOMM DEAL RAISES \u201cFAR MORE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE CONCERNS\u201d VERSUS QUALCOMM-NXP DEAL  * QUALCOMM INC - IN LAST FIVE YEARS, \"SEVERAL LARGE, COMPLEX INTERNATIONAL MERGERS\" INVOLVING MULTIPLE REGULATORS HAVE TAKEN OVER 18 MONTHS Source text : (bit.ly\/2EewnIh) Further company coverage:","371":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday accused Apple Inc of stealing its chip-making secrets and giving them to rival Intel Corp, paving the way for Apple to switch to Intel\u2019s improved semiconductors, which may have cost Qualcomm billions of dollars in lost sales.  FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The accusation, made in a legal filing on Tuesday, is the latest salvo in a drawn-out patent dispute between the two tech heavyweights.  Qualcomm accused Apple of misusing secret Qualcomm software to share information about its chips with Intel engineers in a November lawsuit, but went further on Tuesday by saying Apple stole Qualcomm trade secrets as part of a \u201cmulti-year campaign of sloppy, inappropriate and deceitful conduct\u201d designed to improve rivals\u2019 chipsets and ultimately divert Qualcomm\u2019s Apple-based business to Intel.  Apple declined to comment. Intel, which is not named as a defendant in Qualcomm\u2019s lawsuit, declined to comment.  The world\u2019s most valuable technology company previously used Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips in its iPhone, which helped the device connect to wireless data networks. With the iPhone 7, launched in 2016, Apple began using Intel modem chips in some models instead.  Qualcomm told investors in July it believed its modem chips were completely removed from the newest generation of iPhones released this month, leaving Intel as the sole supplier. Teardowns of the new devices have confirmed that Intel is supplying the modem chips.  Apple has cast doubt on Qualcomm\u2019s claims. Last month, it alleged that Qualcomm refused to answer its questions about which specific confidential information it had improperly shared with Intel. Apple has also alleged that it gave Qualcomm the chance to verify that Qualcomm\u2019s software had been used properly.  The dispute, taking place in San Diego County Superior Court, is one strand of a wide-ranging legal battle in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  Qualcomm asked Judge Jacqueline Stern on Tuesday to allow it to attach the new allegations to its existing complaint rather than force it to file a new lawsuit.  DISCOVERY PHASE  Qualcomm has previously said it gave Apple access to its confidential software tools to help Apple integrate its modem chips into the iPhone.  On Tuesday, Qualcomm alleged that, since filing its lawsuit in November, it has discovered that Apple repeatedly used Qualcomm software to help Intel\u2019s engineers \u201cimprove the sub-par performance of Intel\u2019s chipsets.\u201d  It did not present evidence or say how it found that out. The case is currently in the discovery phase, where parties can exchange evidence.  Qualcomm\u2019s modems rely on a combination of chips and software to allow phones to receive wireless data. Qualcomm gave Apple access its source code and software development tools so Apple could modify Qualcomm\u2019s software for use in the iPhone, on the condition that Apple did not use the code or tools to help another chipmaker.  In Tuesday\u2019s filing, Qualcomm alleged that Apple used the tools to open so-called \u201clog files\u201d from Qualcomm and then gave those files to Intel engineers. Log files contain rows of data generated by computer hardware or software, and engineers often analyze them to pinpoint technical problems and optimize the performance of a chip.  \u201cIntel engineers even complained to Apple engineers about being unable to open Qualcomm log files, which Apple had provided to Intel, for lack of the appropriate Qualcomm tools,\u201d Qualcomm said in its filing.  \u201cIn response, Apple engineers routinely used Qualcomm tools to create post-processed log files, which they sent to Intel engineers to use in improving Intel\u2019s chipset solutions,\u201d it added.  Qualcomm did not specify in its filing what within those log files, or within the other information Apple allegedly gave to Intel, constituted trade secrets. But it said the information helped Intel.  \u201cIt apparently improved Intel chipsets to the point where Apple decided to divert some of Qualcomm\u2019s Apple-based business to Intel,\u201d Qualcomm said in its filing.","372":"Feb 21 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd:  * SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS AND QUALCOMM EXPAND FOUNDRY COOPERATION ON EUV PROCESS TECHNOLOGY Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","373":"FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is shown outside one of the company's many buildings in San Diego, California, U.S., September 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday said it will produce chips for 5G telecommunications networking gear, marking the first entry by a major American technology company into a market dominated by European and Chinese firms.  San Diego-based Qualcomm is already the largest supplier of chips for mobile phones, including the modem chips that connect handsets to newer 5G wireless data networks capable of faster speeds than LTE networks. But the market for the 5G base stations and other infrastructure purchased by telecommunications carriers has been dominated by players such as Nokia, Ericsson and, before the U.S. government moved to cut off its ability to secure semiconductors, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL].  Qualcomm does not plan to challenge those players directly. Instead, it is aiming to potentially become a supplier of chips to those companies and others as the technology in 5G base stations shifts.  Today, 5G base stations are much like early cellular phones, where a single player designs the entire device from top to bottom, ordering up custom chips and writing custom software. But the smart phone sector eventually exploded when Qualcomm began supplying industry standard phone processor chips and Google\u2019s Android operating system enabled hundreds of phone makers to enter the market by basing their devices on the Qulacomm-Android combination.  Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm\u2019s president, said a similar trend is now playing out with 5G base stations, where companies like Microsoft Corp and others are working to write software that will run \u201cvirtualized\u201d 5G base stations. Qualcomm wants to supply the chips for those stations to both existing makers and any new entrants.  \u201cI think we have the advantage in thinking about the next generation infrastructure. We don\u2019t have to worry about any legacy products, so we can start designing something from scratch,\u201d Amon told Reuters in an interview.","374":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O forecast sales revenue for the holiday shopping quarter below analysts' estimates on Wednesday as it took a hit from the loss of chip sales to Apple Inc AAPL.O, sending its shares down 3.4 percent.  A Qualcomm sign is seen during the China International Import Expo (CIIE), at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Aly Song  The San Diego chipmaker also forecast its fiscal 2019 first-quarter profit above analysts\u2019 estimates, but the better-than-expected outlook was largely due to a one-time tax benefit of about 45 cents per share.  Qualcomm is the world\u2019s biggest supplier of chips for smartphones but it has been battered by a slowdown in the industry and the loss of major customer Apple.  It has also faced repeated challenges to a patent licensing model where it takes a cut of the selling price of a mobile phone, both from antitrust regulators and from customers including Apple, which is suing Qualcomm over its practices.  The iPhone maker has excluded Qualcomm from its new iPhones XS and XS Max and XR that launched in September, instead choosing modem chips from rival Intel Corp INTC.O.  Earlier this summer, Qualcomm warned its shareholders that Apple would likely make that move, but the impact has shown up more swiftly than Wall Street expected.  For Qualcomm\u2019s fiscal first quarter that ends in December, the chip firm forecast revenue of between $4.5 billion and $5.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.05 to $1.15 per share. Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.57 billion and earnings of 95 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer George Davis told Reuters that about half of Apple\u2019s chip purchases tended to come during the holiday quarter. Davis said Wall Street analysts may have expected the blow from the Apple loss to be more spread out over the year.  \u201cOur guidance has a reduction of over 50 million (chip) units in the quarter, all of that explained by the absence of being in Apple phones,\u201d Davis told Reuters. \u201cThat\u2019s really the difference.\u201d  On the profit side, Davis said the adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.05 to $1.15 included a 45-cent-per-share benefit from a tax restructuring that would not repeat.  \u201cNet-net, it\u2019s not a disaster,\u201d said analyst Kinngai Chan from Summit Insights Group. \u201cI think Qualcomm can build from here on out with 5G and growth in its adjacent businesses\u201d such as chips for automobiles, Chan said.  Earlier on Wednesday, Reuters reported that Apple is not in talks \u201cat any level\u201d to settle the litigation with Qualcomm, according to a person familiar with the matter. Davis said there was \u201ca lot of focus both internally and externally\u201d on resolving the dispute with licensees, which include Apple, but did not comment on whether the two were in talks about a settlement.  Qualcomm has tried to offset some of the woes related to Apple and the lawsuits by signing more deals with customers that effectively let them pay lower patent licensing rates. It has also reached new deals with large customers like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS.  Also offsetting the Apple impact is a slew of new partnerships between Qualcomm and Chinese mobile phone makers including Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK, Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus, all of which offer lower-cost models in emerging markets like India.  Davis said those Chinese phone makers are increasingly making higher-priced devices that use Qualcomm\u2019s 700- and 800-series Snapdragon chips, which helped improve sales.  \u201cEven though we made some changes to the licensing program that allowed customers to effectively have a lower rate, that came back to us in the form of higher (chip) unit sales,\u201d Davis said.  Qualcomm is also seeking to settle an antitrust lawsuit brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That effort suffered a setback this week when a federal judge issued a preliminary ruling saying Qualcomm must license its patents to chip industry rivals such as Intel Corp INTC.O.  In a conference call with investors, Qualcomm legal chief Don Rosenberg said settlement talks with the FTC are proceeding despite the ruling.  Excluding items, Qualcomm earned 90 cents per share in its fiscal fourth quarter ended in September, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of 83 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue fell to $5.80 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter, but was still above estimates of $5.52 billion.  Qualcomm\u2019s loss was $493 million, or 35 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of $168 million, or 11 cents per share, a year earlier.

M&A activity in Europe has been particularly strong, with deals worth $962.5 billion so far this year, a 72 percent increase compared with a year ago and the strongest period for European dealmaking since 2007.  U.S. M&A, which rose 14 percent year-over-year to $368.1 billion in the quarter, fared better than other regions. Announced deals in Europe fell 14 percent to $151.4 billion, while M&A in Asia-Pacific was down 38 percent to $185.1 billion, the Thomson Reuters data showed.  Among the third quarter\u2019s biggest announced deals were chipmaker Broadcom Inc\u2019s $18 billion acquisition of software maker CA Inc, and Dell Technologies Inc\u2019s proposal to pay $21.7 billion in cash and stock to buy back securities related to its stake in software company VMware Inc.  In August, dealmakers had been chasing potentially the largest buyout of all time, after billionaire Elon Musk tweeted that he had the funding secured to take electric car maker, Tesla Motors Inc private, valuing the company at $72 billion.  Musk had said he had held early talks about the buyout with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, a move that highlighted the growing importance in alternative pools of capital around the world, from sovereign wealth funds to pension funds. Musk decided to scrap the plan and was sued on Thursday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over his tweets.  Hernan Cristerna, co-head of global M&A at JPMorgan, said he believes companies will gradually shy away from mega deals but remain active in midsize ones, despite the uncertain environment  \u201cGoing forward it will be hard to sustain the number of $10 billion-plus deals,\u201d Cristerna said. \u201cNext year we will see fewer transformational moves but there will be a large amount of activity in the $3 billion to $5 billion deal range because companies see the logic of doing M&A and are conscious of the difficulties and risks of going through a big transaction.\u201d  Dealmakers said that regulatory risk remains a concern across the globe.  \u201cAntitrust reviews are more difficult to predict,\u201d said Alexandra Soto, Lazard Ltd\u2019s chief operating officer of financial advisory in Europe and globally. \u201cThe traditional definition of markets is changing and entire industries have been disrupted by new technologies.\u201d  Soto said companies remained interested in getting deals done to stay relevant. \u201cYou have to be opportunistic when you operate in a disrupted market and keep on moving rather than standing still,\u201d she said.

REUTERS\/Stringer  Qualcomm has been forced to defend its track record this year after upsetting some investors by rebuffing a $120 billion takeover bid from rival Broadcom Inc, failing to secure Chinese regulatory approval for its $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV, and failing to resolve a longstanding patent dispute with Apple Inc.  Investors expressed dissatisfaction with the company last March when most of Qualcomm\u2019s board directors, including Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf, were elected with voting support of less than 50 percent of the shares outstanding even though they were unopposed.  That followed the exit of the board\u2019s chairman Paul Jacobs, who stepped down to explore a long-shot acquisition offer for the company, which has yet to materialize.  Irene Rosenfeld, who stepped down last year as CEO of U.S. snack foods company Mondelez International Inc, and Martin Anstice, CEO of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Lam Research Corp, are in advanced talks to join Qualcomm\u2019s board, the sources told Reuters on Tuesday.  Their addition to the board would expand it from 12 directors to 14. Qualcomm appointed Neil Smit, vice chairman of U.S. cable operator Comcast Corp, and Mark Fields, former CEO of car maker Ford Motor Co, to its board in June.  More additions to the company\u2019s board next year are possible, the sources said. Board member Thomas Horton, the former chairman of American Airlines Group Inc, is considering whether to seek re-election next year after serving as a director for 10 years and has yet to make a decision, according to two of the sources.  The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Qualcomm declined to comment.  Qualcomm is under pressure to deliver on the financial goals it laid out while defending itself against Broadcom. The hostile bid was blocked in March by U.S. President Donald Trump over national security concerns.  The financial targets include a sharp increase in earnings per share. Qualcomm is targeting $6.75 to $7.50 in fiscal 2019, compared with $4.28 in fiscal 2017, its last full year. That hinges on resolving its licensing disputes and continuing to diversify revenue.  The San Diego-based company kicked off a $30 billion stock buyback earlier this year, it resolved a patent row with client Samsung Electronics Co, and said it expects to bring in $1 billion in sales from chips for smartwatches and speakers, part of the $5 billion in sales this year it expects from sources outside its core mobile phone chip market.  Qualcomm\u2019s efforts are satisfying some investors. Its shares have risen more than 50 percent since April and recently hit an almost four-year high.","384":"Feb 13 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Thursday will urge a U.S. appeals court to reverse a ruling that it abused its position as a giant of the semiconductor industry and overcharged smartphone makers for access to its patented technology.  The San Francisco-based U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments in a closely watched antitrust case the U.S. Federal Trade Commission brought against Qualcomm in early 2017, during the final days of former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.  The three judges hearing the arguments will likely take several months to issue their ruling but could give some indication on Thursday of how they will rule.  San Diego, California-based Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips that connect phones and other devices to wireless data networks, is fighting a May 2019 decision by a lower court judge in favor of the competition regulator.  In that decision, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh said Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices had \u201cstrangled competition\u201d and harmed consumers. The 9th Circuit put Koh\u2019s ruling on hold while it considered Qualcomm\u2019s appeal.  In an unusual move, a lawyer for the U.S. Department of Justice will argue in support of Qualcomm at Thursday\u2019s hearing.  The Justice Department shares authority over U.S. antitrust laws with the FTC. The two agencies rarely have such public disagreements, said Jonathan Rubin, an antitrust lawyer at MoginRubin.  In addition to dominating the modem chip market, Qualcomm generates billions of dollars annually from licensing a vast portfolio of patents on wireless communication technology. Some of Qualcomm\u2019s patents are essential to industry standards, and the company has pledged to license them to other industry players on fair and reasonable terms.  The FTC\u2019s civil lawsuit accused Qualcomm of using its lucrative stockpile of patents to bolster its chip business because it refused to license them to rival chip suppliers, denying them the intellectual property needed to make competing chips. Instead, the FTC alleged, Qualcomm forced phone makers to sign license agreements for the patents, refusing to sell them its own chips without a valid license in place.  Judge Koh\u2019s ruling in favor of the FTC would force Qualcomm to license its patents to rivals such as Taiwan-based MediaTek Inc and renegotiate its license deals with handset makers.  The FTC\u2019s case was backed by Apple Inc, which filed its own U.S. antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm. The two companies settled that case in April 2019 following two years of increasingly bitter legal battles.

Judge Gonzalo Curiel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on Thursday ruled that Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, was obligated to pay nearly $1 billion in rebate payments to Apple, which for years used Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips to connect iPhones to wireless data networks.  The payments were part of a business cooperation agreement between the two companies amid the peculiar patent licensing practices of the consumer electronics industry.  In general, the contract factories that built Apple\u2019s iPhones would pay Qualcomm billions of dollars per year for the use of Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology in iPhones, a cost that Apple would reimburse the contract factories for. Separately, Qualcomm and Apple had a cooperation agreement under which Qualcomm would pay Apple a rebate on the iPhone patent payments if Apple agreed not to attack in court or with regulators.  In a lawsuit filed two years ago, Apple sued Qualcomm, alleging that the chip supplier had broken the cooperation agreement by not paying nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebates.  Qualcomm in turn alleged that it stopped paying the rebate payments because Apple had broken the agreement by urging other smartphone makers to complain to regulators and making \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d statements to the Korean Fair Trade Commission, which was investigating Qualcomm over antitrust allegations. Apple responded that it was making lawful responses to regulators in an ongoing investigation.  Judge Curiel sided with Apple, ruling that Qualcomm owed the missed rebate payments.  \u201cAlthough the Court today did not view Apple\u2019s conduct as a breach of Apple\u2019s promises to Qualcomm in the 2013 Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement, the exposure of Apple\u2019s role in these events is a welcome development,\u201d Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, told Reuters in a statement.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  However, the decision will not become final until after the trial in the case, which begins next month. And it is unlikely that Qualcomm will make a new payment to Apple.  Apple\u2019s contract factories, which under normal circumstances would pay Qualcomm for patent royalties owed on iPhones, have already withheld the nearly $1 billion in payments to Qualcomm. Qualcomm\u2019s Rosenberg said those withheld iPhone payments have already been accounted for in Qualcomm\u2019s existing financial statements.  \u201cApple has already offset the payment at issue under the agreement against royalties that were owed to Qualcomm,\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s Rosenberg told Reuters.

The foray by 5-year-old Shenzhen-based OnePlus comes after U.S. mobile carriers AT&T T.N and Verizon VZ.N this year backed away from plans to work with China's Huawei on high-end phones in face of pressure from the U.S. government, which considers Huawei a security risk.  The United States also briefly banned companies from selling goods to ZTE 000063.SZ , which was caught shipping U.S. technology to Iran and North Korea, violating U.S. sanctions.  \u201cGiven the involvement of the Chinese government with other Chinese telecommunications companies, we should always take a close look any time a new Chinese telecommunications supplier tries to enter the domestic market,\u201d said U.S. Senator Mark Warner, in an emailed response to a Reuters question. \u201cThere can be real security concerns here, as we saw with Huawei and ZTE.\u201d  But the OnePlus alliance, announced at an event on Monday in New York, shows how many U.S.-China business relationships, including those involving the most advanced technologies, are marching ahead despite the escalating U.S. China trade war.  T-Mobile said the OnePlus 6T smart phone would launch exclusively at the carrier\u2019s stores on Nov. 1 with a starting price of $549, the first time a OnePlus handset has been sold through a U.S. wireless provider - and a deal that the firm\u2019s larger rivals such as Huawei could not pull off.  While some OnePlus models have been on sale in the United States through e-commerce websites, carrier relationships like the one with T-Mobile are critical because most U.S. consumers still purchase phones through their carriers.  Slideshow ( 14 images )  \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is a good time for anybody else,\u201d Carl Pei, the 29-year-old founder of OnePlus, said of the prospect of entering the U.S. carrier-bundled phone market during an interview with Reuters at an event in Hong Kong last week. \u201cIt is a good time for us.\u201d  In an interview on Monday, Jon Freier, T-mobile\u2019s executive vice president of U.S. retail, said the U.S.-China trade battle played no role in this deal and the carrier has not heard from U.S. regulators. \u201cOnePlus has a sterling reputation, and we\u2019ve researched the device and vetted it thoroughly,\u201d Freier said.  Xiaomi, a Chinese rival that also focuses on feature-packed phones at bargain prices, has said it plans to launch in the United States next year but did not respond to a request for comment on whether those plans are still in place.  OnePlus is unusual among Chinese tech companies, which typically focus on mass-market products for domestic customers. OnePlus, by contrast, only sells premium phones that cost $400 or more and almost exclusively online except in India. It derives two-thirds of its revenue from outside China and is the top seller of premium smartphones in India.  OnePlus is affiliated with OPPO, a Chinese smartphone-maker and a major force in mid-end phones, which are sold globally and cost about $300. The relationship helps OnePlus keep its costs low, said Canalys analyst Mo Jia.  According to Chinese company registration records, the two companies have common shareholders.  Pei shrugged off any concerns that U.S. consumer sentiment would be affected by the China-US trade conflict. \u201cAt the end of the day, all you can control is your own [product].\u201d  Pei, who was born in China and raised in Sweden, said the brand is cross-cultural and international: \u201cWhen we started, we saw that through social media, you can talk to everyone around the world, as long as you can speak their language.\u201d  \u201cIf OnePlus is an independent actor and not under the thumb of the Chinese communist party, we should welcome them to compete in the US market,\u201d Senator Warner said. \u201cBut we need to make sure they are that independent actor and cannot be leveraged by the Chinese government to hurt our national security.\u201d","387":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to pause the enforcement of a sweeping antitrust ruling against mobile chip supplier Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday, citing support from the Energy Department and Defense Department.

Qualcomm, the largest supplier of modem chips that connect smartphones to wireless data networks, on May 21 lost in an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission earlier this year.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ruled that Qualcomm had engaged in anticompetitive patent-licensing practices to keep a monopoly on the mobile chip market. Koh ordered Qualcomm to license its technology to rival chipmakers, which include firms like Taiwan\u2019s MediaTek Inc and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd\u2019s HiSilicon chip unit.  Qualcomm has been fighting to have the ruling put on hold while it pursues an appeal. The San Diego, California, company has argued that letting the ruling stand could upend its talks with phone makers over chips for 5G, the next generation of wireless data networks.  Koh declined to pause the ruling, bringing the case before the 9th Circuit.  The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division had asked Koh to hold an additional hearing about potential penalties before she made her ruling, but she declined to do so.  In a friend of the court filing on Tuesday, Justice Department attorneys argued her ruling was \u201cerroneous\u201d and called her decision to forego additional hearings \u201cunlawful.\u201d  Energy Department officials also filed in favor of a pause.  \u201cDOE\u2019s missions in nuclear security and protection of the Nation\u2019s energy and nuclear infrastructure are dependent on secure and advanced wireless communications, of which Qualcomm is the major and predominant U.S. supplier of both current generation and upcoming 5G chipsets,\u201d wrote chief information officer Max Everett.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Federal Trade Commission\u2019s lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleges that Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing and chip sale practices were anticompetitive and sought to preserve a monopoly on so-called premium LTE modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data network.  At the hearing in San Jose, California, an attorney for the FTC said there are \u201cstill discussions going on\u201d with Qualcomm about settling the case, but a Qualcomm attorney said there was \u201cno news\u201d about the status of the talks. The two sides disclosed they were in talks in October.  The case, which began in 2017, is headed to trial in January, but the cutoff for the two sides to gather evidence ended in March.  Since March, Qualcomm has disclosed that Apple completely stopped using its modems in its newest iPhones and switched to chips from Intel Corp. Qualcomm has also broadened its use of a lower-cost licensing model for technology for the next generation of mobile data networks, with several phone makers already signing the deals.  Qualcomm argued in court papers that the new market conditions would likely show that it does not have the monopoly on modem chips that the FTC alleges.  But Judge Lucy Koh rejected the request in a pre-trial decision, saying that the case was about Qualcomm\u2019s business conduct and not its market power.  \u201cQualcomm does not argue that any post-discovery evidence shows a change in Qualcomm\u2019s own business conduct.

Last month, she ruled that Qualcomm must grant patent licenses to its technology to rival chipmakers if they request it.  If the FTC wins its case against Qualcomm, regulators could impose fines and force the company to change some of its business practices around patent licensing, which drive more of the chip supplier\u2019s profits than chip sales.  Regulators in South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere have reached decisions against Qualcomm and imposed billions of dollars in fines.  However, Qualcomm has appealed many of the decisions and settled some of them, for example by agreeing with Taiwanese regulators to invest $700 million in that country\u2019s technology sector.","390":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, on Thursday pushed further into the PC market with a line of chips designed to power business machines.  Qualcomm's \"Snapdragon\" processor chips historically have been at the heart of mobile phones like Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Pixel phone and many Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS devices.  Over the past year, though, Qualcomm adapted its chips to operate PCs running Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Windows operating system, making those machines start up more quickly and stay connected to the Internet constantly, much like a mobile phone or tablet.  But the chips Qualcomm used in those early PCs were essentially modified versions of the chips it sold for mobile phones. At an event in Hawaii on Thursday, Qualcomm officials said they have created a new series of chips called the Snapdragon 8cx that will be dedicated to PCs.  The biggest difference is the new Qualcomm chips will support Windows 10 Enterprise, the version of Microsoft\u2019s popular operating system that is sold to businesses. Previous Qualcomm chips supported only the consumer versions of Windows, making business customers less likely to purchase computers powered by them.  Qualcomm's move puts it in greater competition with chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O, which last year still derived more than half of its $62.8 billion in revenue from PC chips and dominates that market. Intel's association with Windows PCs was so strong that the computer industry referred to them as \"Wintel\" machines for decades.  Qualcomm and others are also challenging Intel's supremacy in the data center business. Qualcomm's chips are powered by technology from SoftBank Group Corp-controlled Arm Holdings. Several companies - including Amazon.com's AMZN.O cloud division Amazon Web Services, a major Intel customer - are working to make ARM-based chips suitable for data centers. [nL2N1Y31HG]"}}
