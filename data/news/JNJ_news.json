FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The verdict, in California Superior Court in Oakland, marks the latest defeat for the healthcare conglomerate facing more than 13,000 talc-related lawsuits nationwide.  J&J said it would appeal, citing \u201cserious procedural and evidentiary errors\u201d in the course of the trial, saying lawyers for the woman had fundamentally failed to show its baby powder contains asbestos. The company did not provide further details of the alleged errors during the trial.  \u201cWe respect the legal process and reiterate that jury verdicts are not medical, scientific or regulatory conclusions about a product,\u201d J&J said in a statement on Wednesday.  The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company denies that its talc causes cancer, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown that its talc is safe and asbestos-free.  The lawsuit was brought by Terry Leavitt, who said she used Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower - another powder containing talc sold by J&J in the past - in the 1960s and 1970s and was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2017. It was the first of more than a dozen J&J talc cases scheduled for trial in 2019. The nine-week trial began on Jan. 7 and included testimony from nearly a dozen experts on both sides.  The jury deliberated for two days before delivering its verdict, which was broadcast online by Courtroom View Network.  Jurors found that J&J\u2019s talc-based products used by Leavitt were defective and that the company had failed to warn consumers of the health risks, awarding $29.4 million in damages to Leavitt and her husband. The jury declined to award punitive damages.  \u201cYet another jury has rejected J&J\u2019s misleading claims that its talc was free of asbestos,\u201d said Moshe Maimon, a lawyer for Leavitt, in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThe internal J&J documents that the jury saw, once more laid bare the shocking truth of decades of cover- up, deception and concealment by J&J.\u201d  Leavitt\u2019s was the first talc case to go to trial since Reuters on Dec. 14 published a report detailing that J&J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results it did not disclose to regulators or consumers.  Leavitt\u2019s trial originally included J&J\u2019s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, a unit of Imerys SE, as a co-defendant. California Superior Court Judge Brad Seligman, who oversaw the trial, told jurors in February that the company was no longer part of the case after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the weight of the talc litigation, which stayed lawsuits against it.  While earlier talc lawsuits alleged talc itself causes ovarian cancer, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have more recently focused on arguing asbestos contamination in talc caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, a form of cancer linked to asbestos exposure.  In 11 cases so far alleging asbestos contamination in talc, three have resulted in wins for plaintiffs, awarding damages as high as $4.69 billion in a July 2018 multi-plaintiff ovarian cancer verdict. J&J won three other cases and another five ended in hung juries.  J&J has appealed all of the plaintiff verdicts, and the company said it is confident the verdicts would be overturned on appeal.

The healthcare conglomerate late Monday said it had temporarily paused its COVID-19 vaccine candidate clinical trials due to an unexplained illness in a study participant, delaying one of the highest profile efforts to contain the global pandemic.  Quarterly sales rose to $21.08 billion from $20.73 billion. (Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)","4":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Missouri Supreme Court ruling on talc lawsuits could reduce the liability and number of large trials Johnson & Johnson faces over allegations its talc products, including baby powder, cause cancer.  FILE PHOTO: Bottles of Johnson & Johnson baby powder line a drugstore shelf in New York October 15, 2015. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  The ruling will likely offer some respite to the healthcare conglomerate as it deals with growing pressure over the safety of its talc products, some defense lawyers said. The company revealed in its annual report on Wednesday that it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission related to talc litigation.  Some plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, however, played down the impact of the ruling.  It was a trial in St. Louis\u2019s 22nd Circuit Court, brought by 21 plaintiffs from outside of the city whose cases were joined to that of a single St. Louis resident, that in July produced a record $4.69 billion talc verdict against J&J. The company is facing several more such lawsuits in St. Louis.  However, Missouri\u2019s high court on Feb. 13 ruled in a separate talc case that allowed a non-resident to participate in joined cases was \u201ca clear and direct violation\u201d of state law barring the use of joinder - combining two or more cases - to allow courts to hear cases they otherwise could not.  Most state courts can only hear cases involving plaintiffs or defendants from that state or alleging injuries occurring within their jurisdiction. The U.S. Supreme Court strengthened those restrictions in a 2017 decision.  But the St. Louis court had allowed out-of-state residents to continue to sue New Jersey-based J&J through liberal use of joinder. In the case that produced the July verdict, 18 of the plaintiffs were from outside Missouri and three were from outside the city of St. Louis. Of the roughly 700 talc cases filed in St. Louis, only 40 involve Missouri residents, according to court filings.  If the Feb. 13 ruling closes off the St. Louis court to non-resident claims, J&J may have a stronger hand defending itself in smaller talc cases spread out among other, potentially less plaintiff-friendly state and federal courts.  \u201cThere\u2019s no real way of reading this decision other than this court clearly saying you can\u2019t join claims if the injury did not occur in the venue,\u201d said Mark Cheffo, a New York-based product liability defense lawyer not involved in talc litigation.  J&J in a statement said it was pleased with the decision. \u201cOne claim that is properly before a court cannot provide a basis for drawing into a trial other claims that are not. We believe that decision is clearly correct, and we continue to believe that the science doesn\u2019t support plaintiffs\u2019 claims,\u201d the company said, declining further comment.  IMPACT UNCLEAR  Some plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said the Feb. 13 ruling was not as definitive as Cheffo suggests.  \u201cIf defendants are celebrating this ruling as the end of St. Louis mass tort, they have not read the entire Missouri case law,\u201d said Eric Holland, a St. Louis-based plaintiff lawyer involved in the talc litigation.  Holland pointed to a 2016 Missouri Supreme Court decision that upheld a $38 million verdict in a pharmaceutical product liability case the defendant claimed had been improperly joined. The court let the result stand, saying that even an improper joinder did not render the trial unfair to defendants.  Though the 2016 ruling involved a case already decided, Holland and other plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said they planned to argue its fairness analysis also applies to out-of-state talc claims in cases yet to go to trial. They said they would also argue joining the cases was the most efficient use of judicial resources.  Defense lawyers said the Feb. 13 decision would likely mean dismissal or severing of the out-of-state claims from four upcoming multi-plaintiff cases scheduled for trial in St. Louis. Two of the cases were halted by the Missouri Supreme Court ahead of its ruling.  Holland and other plaintiff lawyers said they would challenge J&J requests to sever or dismiss talc cases by arguing the Feb. 13 decision did not overrule the 2016 ruling.  Cheffo said the 2016 ruling could make it harder for J&J to overturn the July verdict and its record penalty because the company would have to prove the joinder led to an unfair trial.  \u2018FORUM SHOPPING\u2019 BY OUT-OF-STATE PLAINTIFFS  The St. Louis court has been a venue for more talc trials and has seen larger verdicts than any other jurisdiction. Outside of St. Louis, the only other significant talc verdicts against J&J to date have come in lawsuits filed by individual plaintiffs in New Jersey and California, where the company is currently facing jury verdicts totaling $142 million.  A Los Angeles jury delivered a $417 million talc verdict against J&J in 2017, but the judge threw out the award weeks later as unsupported by the evidence. All talc verdicts against J&J are on appeal.  The St. Louis court has a history of issuing large punitive damages against companies and has often been criticized by business groups as allowing \u201cforum-shopping\u201d by out-of-state plaintiffs.  While J&J faces some trials brought by individuals in other jurisdictions, the multi-plaintiff St. Louis cases are the largest and have the most potential to produce additional billion-dollar verdicts.  Plaintiffs allege that the talc in Johnson\u2019s baby powder and other J&J products causes ovarian cancer, or that asbestos contamination in the talc causes ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. Asbestos is a known carcinogen linked to mesothelioma.  J&J and its talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, a co-defendant in the litigation, deny the allegations, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown their talc to be safe and asbestos-free.  Reuters on Dec. 14 published a report detailing that J&J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results it did not disclose to regulators or consumers. (reut.rs\/2Gh88KO)  J&J is currently facing roughly 13,000 lawsuits over talc, most of which have been consolidated in federal court in New Jersey. Many plaintiff\u2019s lawyers have fought to keep cases out of federal court, which they feel favors corporate defendants.  Three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs\u2019 mesothelioma. Five other juries have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials.  In a statement, Imerys Talc America said the Missouri ruling affirmed legal arguments it has made in litigation for the last four years. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Feb. 13, saying it lacked the financial clout to defend against talc lawsuits.","5":"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday forecast 2019 sales that fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates and said it expected further pressure on U.S. prescription drug prices, weighing on the broader pharmaceutical sector.  A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  J&J, the first major drugmaker to report fourth-quarter results, said it expects full-year sales of $80.4 billion to $81.2 billion, below Wall Street estimates of $82.69 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company also said it expected adjusted 2019 earnings of $8.50 to $8.65 per share, putting the midpoint below analysts\u2019 expectations of $8.60 per share.  J&J shares were down 2 percent at $128.02, while the broader S&P 500 healthcare sector was off 1.1 percent.  The healthcare conglomerate on a call with analysts said that net prices of its medicines declined 6 percent to 8 percent in 2018 after falling 4.6 percent in 2017. J&J did raise U.S. list prices on about two dozen prescription drugs earlier this month, including on its top-selling products.  The company is \u201cobviously engaged with the (Trump) administration and a lot of different groups right now on the issue of pharmaceutical pricing,\u201d Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said on call with analysts.  He said the company had some concerns related to reference pricing, a proposal to tie U.S. drug pricing to the average price paid for drugs in a handful of other developed nations, where the governments directly or indirectly control medicine costs.  \u201cWe are concerned about some unintended consequences around access and innovation as it relates to some of the proposals,\u201d Gorsky said.  Drugmakers have come under intense pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump and Congress to lower out-of-pocket medical costs for consumers.  Gorsky attempted to deflect some of that responsibility, saying medicines and medical devices combined for about 20 percent of costs to patients. The remaining 80 percent, he said, comes \u201cfrom outside our industry.\u201d  While J&J has huge medical device and consumer health divisions, its pharmaceuticals unit has been its main growth driver in recent years.  Strength in the pharmaceuticals business also helped offset higher costs, including a doubling of litigation expense in the fourth quarter to $1.29 billion.  Most of that was related to resolving older lawsuits in its medical devices business, spokesman Ernie Knewitz said in an email response to Reuters. For the full year, litigation expenses rose to $1.9 billion from $1.3 billion in 2017. About 10 percent of that total was related to talc, Knewitz said.  J&J is facing more than 11,000 lawsuits over the safety of talc in its products, including baby powder, alleging that its use caused cancer.  \u201cWe remain committed to ensuring the facts about our talc are understood and we will continue to defend the safety of our products,\u201d Gorsky said.  Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report detailing that the company knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos could be found in its talc.  J&J has repeatedly said that its talc products are safe, and that decades of studies have shown them to be asbestos-free and that they do not cause cancer.  Excluding items, J&J said it earned $1.97 per share for the fourth quarter, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate by 2 cents.  Sales in the quarter rose about 1 percent to $20.39 billion, topping Wall Street estimates of $20.20 billion.  Sales of Stelara for psoriasis and Crohn\u2019s disease jumped 33.6 percent to $1.44 billion.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  J&J said that its widely-used baby powder never contained asbestos, a known carcinogen linked to mesothelioma.  The case also names as a defendant a local unit of Rite Aid, one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, which allegedly sold the baby powder used by the woman.  The case marked the first time a drugstore was involved in a talcum powder liability trial and a lawyer for the company, Sarah Johnston, said there was no reason for Rite Aid to be part of the suit.  In opening statements, a lawyer for the family of Bertila Boyd-Bostic, who died of a rare form of cancer in 2017 at the age of 30, told a jury in the Darlington County Court of Common Pleas that J&J had known for decades that its baby powder contained asbestos.  J&J and its supplier, a unit of Imerys SA, deny the allegations, and their lawyers said their talc product did not cause any form of cancer, according to an online broadcast of the trial by Courtroom View Network.  The case is one of several in recent months that alleged asbestos in talc products caused mesothelioma..  A New Jersey state court jury in April ordered J&J and Imerys to pay $117 million to a man who alleged he developed mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure from J&J Baby Powder. An appeal is pending.  J&J has also been battling some 6,000 cases claiming its baby powder caused ovarian cancer.  Boyd-Bostic used baby powder nearly all her life, her family\u2019s lawyer, Christopher Swett, said on Monday.

The company, however, is lagging rivals Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc in the race for a vaccine to combat the COVID-19 pandemic that has infected about 75 million people globally.  J&J's study, named Ensemble, is being conducted by its unit Janssen, the drugmaker said here in a statement.  While seven countries have already authorized the emergency use of Pfizer and German firm BioNTech\u2019s candidates, Moderna\u2019s rival vaccine was set for regulatory authorization this week in the United States.

The company had earlier this month announced cuts in enrollment for the vaccine trial from its original plan for 60,000, as higher rates of COVID-19 infections amid a worsening pandemic should generate the data it needs with fewer study subjects.  The Ensemble trial was paused for over a week in October after a patient developed an \u201cunexplained illness\u201d during the study.

The move would be the first arranged by the European Union executive since it was mandated by the 27 EU national governments to use an emergency fund of more than 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) to strike deals with up to six vaccine makers.  The Commission\u2019s deal with the U.S. firm Johnson & Johnson is \u201cin the pipeline\u201d, a top health official from an EU member state said, asking to remain anonymous as these were confidential discussions about vaccines between the EU executive and EU governments.  A second EU source said the Commission had a call with Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday about the possible agreement.  A Commission spokesman had no comment. Johnson & Johnson was not immediately available for comment outside U.S. business hours.  It was unclear whether any deal would involve an advance purchase of the vaccine in testing, or an option to buy it.  Johnson & Johnson plans next month to start human clinical trials for its experimental vaccine against the highly contagious coronavirus, which has infected more than 8.36 million people worldwide, with 447,985 deaths.  Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands said last week they had acquired 400 million potential vaccine doses, in principle available to all member states, from British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which is developing a COVID-19 shot in conjunction with Oxford University.  AstraZeneca signed a similar deal in May with the United States.  DEAL AS SOON AS NEXT WEEK?  The health official source said the EU deal with Johnson & Johnson could be announced as early as next week, but cautioned it might take a little longer to finalise, and there was a chance it might not be struck at all.  He said the EU was also seeking a deal with French vaccine-maker Sanofi. A spokesman for Sanofi had no immediate comment.  EU decision-making procedures pose a potential sticking point, with member states still in talks over the establishment of a steering board for vaccine negotiations with drugmakers, officials told Reuters.  They said that under a draft plan devised by the EU Commission, which is still to be approved by EU governments, a green light from just four member states would be enough to start formal EU talks with a drugmaker.  But, underlining the urgency of securing a vaccine for the EU\u2019s 450 million population, the Commission had already begun talks with Johnson & Johnson even before the steering board has been agreed.  The Netherlands has also been involved in these initial talks with Johnson & Johnson, as a representative of the alliance of the four EU countries that struck the AstraZeneca deal, officials told Reuters.  This alliance is expected to halt negotiations with drugmakers once the EU has appointed its negotiation team, to avoid competition among EU states, officials said.  \u201cJohnson and Johnson\u2019s vaccine is one of the promising initiatives,\u201d a spokesman for the Dutch health ministry said, declining to comment on the talks underway.  By buying vaccines under development, the EU risks acquiring shots that may eventually prove unsuccessful against COVID-19.  But the risk is justified by the need to secure enough doses for the EU population in the global race for an effective vaccine, EU officials say.

REUTERS\/Sumaya Hisham  During a televised annual state of the nation address, Ramaphosa said South Africa had secured 9 million doses of the J&J vaccine, with 500,000 expected to arrive over the next four weeks so authorities can start inoculating health workers. Another 20 million doses of the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech were also on their way, he said.  South Africa has been hit hard by a second wave of COVID-19, after the discovery of a new variant in the Eastern Cape, called 501Y.V2, believed to be 50% more contagious than earlier versions of the coronavirus.  It has already spread to two dozen other countries.  \u201cDriven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave,\u201d Ramaphosa said. \u201cWe must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections.\u201d  In addition, the COVAX facility co-led by the World Health Organization will provide 12 million vaccine doses, he said.  COVID-19 has claimed more than 47,000 lives and infected nearly 1.5 million in South Africa since the pandemic began.  Ramaphosa said the economy had shrunk by 6% between the third quarter of 2019 and that of 2020, while unemployment \u201cnow stands at a staggering 30.8%,\u201d after 1.7 million jobs were lost.  South Africa had been pinning its hopes on the cheaper AstraZeneca vaccine. Emerging scientific evidence that it is less effective against the local virus variant than other vaccines led it to switch.South Africa\u2019s health minister on Wednesday suggested the government may sell doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine it may not need or swap them others.  \u201cWhile it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment,\u201d Ramaphosa said, referring to the switch away from the AstraZeneca shot.  The J&J vaccine requires just one shot, while the Pfizer\/BioNTech option is a two-dose regimen.  REVIVING A RUINED ECONOMY  Ramaphosa outlined a plan to revive Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy, with a massive programme of building or revamping ports, container terminals, energy generation and transmission, water, transport and telecoms.  He also outlined plans to tackle South Africa\u2019s dire energy shortages - which had plunged the economy into recession before the pandemic - by greatly expanding capacity, especially in renewable power.  It was unclear how the government would fund the ambitious plans.  South Africa is deeply in debt, and the Treasury expects a budget deficit of 15% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the financial year ending March 2021. Ratings downgrades by Moody\u2019s and Fitch late last year, putting its debt deeper into junk, will drive up borrowing costs.  The government will seek bids for 2600 megawatts (MW) of solar and wind power to plug generation shortfall estimated by power utility Eskom in the coming weeks, he said.  Another round of bids will be invited in August 2021, he said, adding that this will be over and above the power procurement plans already announced.  Due to its reliance on coal power, South Africa is one of the world\u2019s major CO2 emitters.

Balkman reduced the amount he had awarded in August by $107 million after agreeing with New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J that he had made a math error.  J&J said it will appeal, and that the award and finding of liability were \u201cneither supported by the facts nor the law.\u201d  A spokesman for Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter said that office is reviewing the decision and will formally respond within the next few days.  Opioids were involved in almost 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Following a non-jury trial, Balkman ruled in August that Oklahoma had proven that J&J engaged in misleading marketing about the benefits of painkillers, and that their addictive risks caused a public nuisance in the form of the opioid crisis.  Hunter had sought to have J&J pay $17 billion to help fund addiction treatment and other services to repair damage from the opioid epidemic over the next 30 years.  Balkman, however, awarded only enough money for one year of programs, saying Oklahoma failed to support its claims regarding the need to abate the epidemic in future years.  Following the August ruling, Oklahoma asked Balkman for permission to return to his courtroom annually to prove those costs, but Balkman on Friday maintained his prior ruling.  J&J, meanwhile, argued that it deserved a $355 million credit, reflecting pre-trial settlements by the drugmakers Purdue Pharma LP and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.  Balkman concluded on Friday that state law did not allow such credits.  Last month, J&J and four other companies proposed a $48 billion settlement framework to resolve all of the opioid cases they face, with J&J paying $4 billion. Lawyers for the local governments have opposed the proposal.  If approved, the settlement would let J&J resolve some of the thousands of product liability lawsuits it faces.

The Chilean Health Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.  The J&J trial is one of several likely to take place in Chile. Sinovac - whose trial is funded by the Chilean government, local industry and academia - is due to launch a search for volunteers shortly, while the country is also in talks with CanSino Biologics Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc.  In Peru, Carlos Castillo, the Ministry of Health\u2019s chief vaccines adviser, told Reuters that J&J was picking research centers and the trial would get under way in mid-September.  On Wednesday the Chinese firm Sinopharm began recruiting for 6,000 volunteers for its own vaccine trials. Peru President Martin Vizcarra has said he also hopes to confirm by the end of August trials of the AstraZeneca\/Oxford University vaccine.  J&J\u2019s prototype uses \u201cviral vectors\u201d to generate immune responses, similar to the approach taken by Oxford\u2019s vaccine developers and China\u2019s CanSino.  Brazil, Chile, Peru, Argentina, Mexico and Colombia are the six Latin nations with the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases. Vaccine developers look for areas with high rates of active transmission and infection because that renders it easier to get dependable trial results.  J&J\u2019s head of vaccines previously told Reuters the company aimed to produce 1 billion doses of a potential vaccine next year.","24":"LONDON, June 19 (Reuters) - Johnson & has decided to stop selling skin whitening creams popular in Asia and the Middle East, it has said, after such products have come under renewed social pressure in recent weeks amid a global debate about racial inequality.  Johnson & Johnson will stop selling its Clean & Clear Fairness line of products, sold in India, a spokeswoman told Reuters on Friday. News that it would pull its Neutrogena Fine Fairness line, available in Asia and the Middle East, was reported earlier this month.  \u201cConversations over the past few weeks highlighted that some product names or claims on our dark spot reducer products represent fairness or white as better than your own unique skin tone,\u201d Johnson & Johnson said. \u201cThis was never our intention \u2013 healthy skin is beautiful skin.\u201d  The healthcare company said it would no longer produce or ship the products, but that they might still appear on shelves for a while as stocks run through. (Reporting by Martinne Geller; editing by Jonathan Oatis)","25":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Pressure was mounting on Johnson & Johnson and its signature Baby Powder.  FILE PHOTO: A bottle of Johnson and Johnson Baby Powder is seen in a photo illustration taken in New York, February 24, 2016. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/Illustration\/File Photo  In 2006, an arm of the World Health Organization began classifying cosmetic talc such as Baby Powder as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic\u201d when women used it as a genital antiperspirant and deodorant, as many had been doing for years. Talc supplier Luzenac America Inc started including that information on its shipments to J&J and other customers.  J&J, meanwhile, looked for ways to sell more Baby Powder to two key groups of longtime users: African-American and overweight women. The \u201cright place\u201d to focus, according to a 2006 internal J&J marketing presentation, was \u201cunder developed geographical areas with hot weather, and higher AA population,\u201d the \u201cAA\u201d referring to African-Americans.  \u201cPowder is still considered a relevant product among AA consumers,\u201d the presentation said. \u201cThis could be an opportunity.\u201d  In the following years, J&J turned those proposals into action, internal company documents show. It distributed Baby Powder samples through churches and beauty salons in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods, ran digital and print promotions with weight-loss and wellness company Weight Watchers and launched a $300,000 radio advertising campaign in a half-dozen markets aiming to reach \u201ccurvy Southern women 18-49 skewing African American.\u201d  These are only some of the more recent examples of J&J\u2019s decades-long efforts to offset declining Baby Powder sales amid rising concern about the health effects of talc, based on a Reuters review of years of J&J print, radio and digital advertising campaigns and thousands of pages of internal marketing documents and email correspondence.  Adults have been the main users of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder since at least the 1970s, after pediatricians started warning of the danger to infants of inhaling talc. As adults became ever more crucial to the brand \u2013 accounting for 91 percent of Baby Powder use by the mid-2000s \u2013 J&J honed its powder pitches to court a variety of targeted markets, from teen-focused ads touting the product\u2019s \u201cfresh and natural\u201d qualities, to promotions aimed at older minority and overweight women.  Today, women who fall into those categories make up a large number of the 13,000 plaintiffs alleging that J&J\u2019s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, a powder brand the company sold off in 2012, caused their ovarian cancer or mesothelioma.  Many of the ovarian cancer lawsuits have blamed the disease on perineal use of J&J cosmetic talcs \u2013 a claim supported by some studies showing an association between such use and increased cancer risk. The most recent cases have alleged that J&J\u2019s talc products contained asbestos, long a known carcinogen.  In an investigation published Dec. 14 here, Reuters revealed that J&J knew for decades that small amounts of asbestos had occasionally been found in its raw talc and in Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, based on test results from the early 1970s to the early 2000s \u2013 information it did not disclose to regulators or the public.  J&J challenged the findings of the Reuters report, describing them as inaccurate and misleading.  BABY POWDER \u201cEVERYWHERE\u201d  Krystal Kim, a 53-year-old African-American, was one of 22 plaintiffs whose case in St. Louis resulted in a jury verdict last summer of $4.69 billion against J&J. Kim said Baby Powder and Shower to Shower were household staples among her family and friends when she was growing up in New Jersey. Kim played baseball as a teenager, she said, and her mother told her to apply Baby Powder to avoid being \u201cthe stinky girl.\u201d  \u201cEvery time I took a shower, I put Baby Powder on,\u201d recalled Kim, whose ovarian cancer, first diagnosed in 2014, is now in remission. \u201cI put it on my panties, on my clothes, everywhere.\u201d  J&J is appealing the St. Louis verdict. The company did not respond to requests for an interview with Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky or any other executive to discuss the company\u2019s marketing of cosmetic powders.  In an emailed response to questions from Reuters, J&J said its Baby Powder is safe and asbestos-free. It noted that the company\u2019s marketing over the years has been directed at many demographics and groups, and that \u201cwe\u2019re proud pioneers of the practice of multicultural marketing.\u201d It also pointed out that some Baby Powder ads have featured the cornstarch version of Baby Powder, the safety of which isn\u2019t questioned.  Reports by Bloomberg News, the New York Times and the Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, have cited some internal J&J documents revealing the company\u2019s focus on African-American and overweight women at certain times. But the full timeline and scale of the marketing efforts, particularly those aimed at teenage girls, in minority communities and through organizations such as Weight Watchers, are reported here for the first time.  Most businesses know the demographic profiles of those who buy their products and, as a matter of course, direct their marketing at those groups. Some \u2013 fast-food companies and soft-drink makers, for example \u2013 have courted minority customers to increase sales among heavy users at times of growing public concern about the possible health effects of their products.  In a lawsuit filed in Mississippi state court in 2014, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood alleges that J&J failed to warn consumers of the risks associated with its talc products and accuses the company of implementing a \u201cracially targeted strategy\u201d for selling Baby Powder after J&J became aware of health concerns. The company focused its marketing on \u201cminority communities expected to be more likely to use the talc products,\u201d Hood claims in the lawsuit.  J&J denied the allegations and last year filed a motion for summary judgment in the suit, arguing that the case involved matters of federal law, beyond the state\u2019s purview. A judge in December denied J&J\u2019s motion, a move the company has appealed. The case is scheduled for trial later this year.  In its response to Reuters\u2019 questions, J&J said: \u201cSuggesting that Johnson & Johnson targeted a particular group with a potentially harmful product is incredibly offensive and patently false.\u201d  \u201cDEEP, PERSONAL TRUST\u201d  Sold continuously since 1894, Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder accounted for less than 1 percent of J&J\u2019s $81.6 billion in revenue last year, but it is deemed critical to the company\u2019s family-friendly image. An internal J&J marketing presentation from 1999 refers to the baby products division, with Baby Powder at the core, as J&J\u2019s \u201c#1 Asset,\u201d grounded in \u201cdeep, personal trust.\u201d  Slideshow ( 11 images )  Beginning in the 1950s, however, a series of case studies published in medical journals pointed to the dangers of breathing in talc. Pediatricians took notice. By the late 1950s, a third of them were recommending cornstarch or oil to treat diaper rash and chafing \u201cbecause there is no dangerous dust\u201d in them, according to an internal J&J report.  A report in the June 1966 edition of the American Journal of Diseases of Children, citing the deaths of three children who inhaled large amounts of talcum powder, concluded there was \u201cno justification\u201d for using the product on babies because it has \u201cno medicinal value.\u201d  By 1974, more than 60 percent of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder sales were \u201cattributable to adults\u201d who used it on themselves, according to a J&J analysis.  Losing the connection to the product\u2019s namesake \u2013 babies \u2013 left J&J eager to cultivate other markets.  Beginning in the 1970s, J&J ran ads clearly intended to woo young women, in addition to its traditional marketing aimed at families with babies. \u201cYou start being sexy when you stop trying,\u201d was the line from an ad that appeared in Seventeen magazine in 1972. The photo shows a young woman stroking a young man\u2019s curly blond hair.  \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling you never outgrow,\u201d is how an ad in Family Circle magazine from the mid-1980s put it, with a photo of a bottle of Baby Powder next to a teddy bear alongside the mirrored reflection of a young woman.  In 1989, advertising firm Young & Rubicam submitted a plan to J&J to \u201cinitiate a high level of usage\u201d among young women to \u201caugment the weakening baby link.\u201d Under the plan, ads in style magazines like Seventeen, YM, Glamour and Mademoiselle would try to convince teen girls that Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder, \u201capplied daily after showering, is a simple, feminine way to smell clean and fresh during the day.\u201d Young & Rubicam, now known as VMLY&R, declined to comment on the document and referred questions to J&J.  Baby Powder sales continued to fall throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Since health professionals had already recommended against using talc on infants, a 1986 internal report warned, a \u201clast straw\u201d safety concern could lead consumers to abandon the product altogether.  As early as 1992, the company keyed in on the sales potential with minority women. A J&J memo that year mentions \u201chigh usage\u201d rates for Baby Powder of 52 percent among African-Americans and 37.6 percent among Hispanic customers \u2013 and notes that women of both ethnicities use the product more than the general population.  The memo suggests investigating \u201cethnic (African American\/Hispanic) opportunities to grow the franchise,\u201d while referring to \u201cnegative publicity from the health community on talc,\u201d including \u201cinhalation, dust, negative doctor endorsement, cancer linkage.\u201d Portions of that memo were cited in reports from Bloomberg and the New York Times.  STAGNATING SALES  By 2006, the company was recognizing that \u201cconsumers do not see a need for powder,\u201d according to a sales presentation that year. Baby Powder shipments had been \u201cstagnating\u201d in recent years, the presentation said, and it was essential to \u201cfind a new business model\u201d that \u201cstrategically and efficiently targets high propensity consumers.\u201d  Those groups, according to the presentation: African-Americans, nearly 60 percent of whom used Baby Powder by this time, compared to about 30 percent for the overall population; overweight people; and fitness-conscious people looking to lose weight.  It was also in 2006 that the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an arm of the World Health Organization, classified perineal use of talc as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic,\u201d saying available research provided \u201climited evidence\u201d it caused cancer in humans. That came about 20 years after IARC classified \u201ctalc containing asbestiform fibres\u201d as \u201ccarcinogenic to humans,\u201d its highest-risk classification.  After the IARC\u2019s 2006 move, talc supplier Luzenac America started including a note about the agency\u2019s latest classification on a chemical safety document accompanying shipments to all customers, including J&J. Under a heading that reads \u201ccarcinogenic status,\u201d the document says IARC \u201chas concluded that perineal use of talc-based body powder is possibly carcinogenic to humans.\u201d  In a deposition for one of the ovarian cancer cases tried in St. Louis, a Luzenac America executive, Shripal Sharma, said the company felt it was important to add what he referred to as a warning to the safety document. Asked whether Luzenac knew that J&J did not pass on this warning, Sharma said: \u201cIt is not our job to tell our customers what to do with their products.\u201d  In a statement to Reuters, Imerys Talc America Inc, as Luzenac is now known, said: \u201cTalc\u2019s safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies,\u201d echoing J&J\u2019s response.  Through an Imerys spokeswoman, Sharma declined to comment.  Two years after the IARC classification, J&J sought proposals for an \u201cAfrican American agency\u201d to develop marketing campaigns for the company\u2019s baby products line. A 2008 document sent to prospective agencies summed up the situation: \u201cJohnson\u2019s Baby Oil and Baby Powder products, while traditionally used only on babies, are today primarily consumed by adult AA women for use on themselves.\u201d One way to reverse the brand\u2019s decline, it said, was by \u201cspeaking to AA consumers with a more relevant message with the most effective media vehicles.\u201d  \u201cETHNIC CONSUMERS\u201d  That year, the company contracted with a North Carolina marketing firm, Segmented Marketing Services Inc, which says it specializes in targeted promotions to \u201cethnic consumers.\u201d The firm would distribute 100,000 gift bags containing Baby Powder and other Johnson\u2019s baby products in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods in Chicago, according to a contract with J&J.  Run by African-Americans who had been executives at Procter & Gamble Co and Quaker Oats, Segmented Marketing Services has said in past press releases and its own marketing publications that it hands out millions of free product samples and promotional offers through national networks of more than 10,000 African-American and Hispanic churches, and tens of thousands of \u201cbeauty salons, barber shops, entertainment venues and healthcare networks.\u201d  The company published an advertorial in 2008 prepared for distribution with Johnson\u2019s baby products in which the firm\u2019s founders, Sandra Miller Jones and Lafayette Jones, said they \u201cwelcome\u201d J&J as a partner.  \u201cWhen caring rituals started in infancy continue through adulthood, a person\u2019s self-confidence and even faith in the world are often strengthened,\u201d the pamphlet said. \u201cWhether in the gym, at work, at church or at the beach, Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder helps grown-ups feel more comfortable in their own skin.\u201d It came with a coupon for $1 off Baby Powder.  Lafayette Jones and Sandra Miller Jones did not respond to calls, emails and LinkedIn messages seeking comment.  J&J also launched campaigns to boost sales of Baby Powder to \u201ccurvy Southern women\u201d and athletic adults who want to smell fresh, according to company documents. It advertised in Weight Watchers magazine and offered promotions through the Lane Bryant clothing chain for plus-size women and Curves, a women\u2019s fitness and weight-loss franchise. Marketing plans also included ads to run in Southern Living magazine and during the Style Network show \u201cRuby,\u201d a reality TV series that documented an obese Georgia woman on a mission to lose weight.  A 2009 presentation laying out the \u201cPowder media plan\u201d highlights that it will reach 31 million people \u201cin the South (hot climates\/overweight states),\u201d and that \u201c43% of our plan will focus on the top 10 overweight states in the nation.\u201d  A 2009 ad in Weight Watchers magazine suggests readers \u201cbust stress with a midday workout\u201d and then \u201cstay fresh post-exercise by applying Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder.\u201d  Internal J&J marketing emails before the Weight Watchers campaign ran discuss whether the women featured are heavy enough to resonate with the intended audience. \u201cCan you ask WW if they have any images of slightly bigger women? They don\u2019t have to be super curvy, but a little bigger than the current image would be preferable,\u201d wrote Grace Lee, a J&J brand manager, to others at the company and ad agency Lowe New York.  Weight Watchers, now known officially as WW International Inc, declined to comment on the campaign. Lee & Interpublic Group of Companies Inc, which owns the former Lowe New York, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  SUMMER SUCCESS  The Weight Watchers campaign was successful, according to a 2009 internal J&J recap, which showed that sales of Baby Powder at Wal-Mart shot up as much as 9 percent during the summer months when the ads ran from the same months a year earlier, reversing a decline.  J&J\u2019s overall Baby Powder media advertising budget increased to a proposed $495,000 for 2010, up 71 percent from $288,000 in 2009, driven by more dedicated spending toward promotions for overweight women.  The company in 2010 launched a radio campaign in the South targeting \u201cCurvy Southern Women 18\u201049 Skewing African American.\u201d A presentation from TMPG, a marketing agency that handles promotions with radio DJs, said the campaign made more than 18 million impressions on the target audience through ads and promotions on \u201curban adult contemporary\u201d radio stations in Southern markets, including Dallas; Atlanta; Nashville; Mobile, Alabama; and Jackson, Mississippi.  The presentation slides feature some photos of plus-size African-American women holding Baby Powder samples at \u201ctargeted station events\u201d that also included spa giveaways and \u201cBaby Powder Stay Cool Cash.\u201d TMPG did not respond to requests for comment.  In a 2010 email, Debra DeStasio, a J&J promotions and marketing manager who oversaw the baby products line at the time, gave the green light to two proposed radio stations for the campaign in Dallas, saying \u201cwe are good with those general market stations that have good Hispanic reach and good AA reach.\u201d In another 2010 email, she said the DJs will be the Baby Powder \u201cbrand ambassadors,\u201d charged with \u201ccommunicating our message, encouraging listeners to call in to talk about how they use Baby Powder and driving to retail where appropriate.\u201d  All the radio promotions would be \u201cbased on the weather,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf it\u2019s hot and humid, we\u2019ll run that week. If it\u2019s rainy or colder, we won\u2019t.\u201d  DeStasio, who now works as a promotions and marketing manager at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, did not respond to requests for comment.  J&J\u2019s spending on Baby Powder promotions \u2013 coupons, discounts, and samples \u2013 came to about $1.2 million in 2008 and again in 2010, almost half of it directed at overweight and minority women. By 2011, the company cut back its promotional spending to $752,000, mostly aimed at the general consumer market.  In 2013, a jury found J&J negligent in the first case ever to claim that regular use of Baby Powder for feminine hygiene caused ovarian cancer. The jury didn\u2019t award monetary damages, but the verdict spawned a cascade of similar lawsuits.  Of the eight ovarian cancer cases that have gone to trial so far, four have resulted in verdicts for plaintiffs and one for the company. Three other verdicts against J&J were overturned on appeal.  In 12 trials of cases claiming that asbestos in talc caused plaintiffs\u2019 mesothelioma, J&J was cleared of liability in five, and plaintiffs won three, resulting in a total of $172 million in damages. Four others resulted in hung juries and mistrials.  J&J is appealing all the verdicts against it.  Meanwhile, J&J has pulled back from marketing specifically to minority and overweight women. A 2015 presentation makes no mention of minorities, suggesting the brand \u201ctarget adults, with a focus on men.\u201d  Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and other advocates have become more vocal in criticizing the targeted marketing campaigns. In its most recent newsletter, the National Council of Negro Women, a women\u2019s leadership group with about 30,000 members, drew attention to the issue with an essay penned by civil-rights lawyer Ben Crump, who is representing some Baby Powder plaintiffs.  In an interview, Janice Mathis, the council\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cLots of products target African-Americans. That\u2019s marketing 101: Go where our customers are. What has me disturbed about this is that you didn\u2019t give any caveat to the customers, once you knew there was a possibility there was some danger.\u201d","26":"Aug 18 (Reuters) -  * U.S. STATES SEEK $26.4 BILLION FROM DRUG COMPANIES IN OPIOID LITIGATION- WSJ  * TALKS WITH U.S. STATES INVOLVE MCKESSON, AMERISOURCEBERGEN, CARDINAL HEALTH, JOHNSON & JOHNSON - WSJ Source: on.wsj.com\/2YdUj6q Further company coverage:","27":"Nov 17 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson\u2019s chief scientist said the drugmaker is recruiting over 1,000 people per day for the late-stage trial of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine and expects to have all the data needed to seek U.S. authorization by February or earlier.  \u201cBy the end of the year or around the end of the year, we should have 60,000 people in the study,\u201d Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J\u2019s chief scientific officer, said in an interview ahead of this week\u2019s Reuters Total Health conference.  \u201cAnd efficacy endpoint should be there in the first few weeks or months, January or February, of the new year,\u201d he added.

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. flag is seen over the company logo for Johnson & Johnson to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the company's listing at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 17, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The move would be the first arranged by the European Union executive since it was mandated by the 27 EU national governments to use an emergency fund of more than 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) to strike deals with up to six vaccine producers.  The Commission\u2019s deal with U.S. company Johnson & Johnson is \u201cin the pipeline\u201d, a top health official from an EU member state said, asking to remain anonymous because the talks were confidential discussions about vaccines between the EU executive and EU governments.  A second EU source said the Commission had a call with Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday about the possible agreement.  A Commission spokesman had no comment.  In response to Reuters\u2019 queries, Johnson & Johnson said it is in talks with multiple governments and global organisations as it seeks to develop a COVID-19 vaccine but declined to comment further.  It was unclear whether any deal would involve an advance purchase of the vaccine in testing or an option to buy it.  Johnson & Johnson plans to start human clinical trials next month for its experimental vaccine against the highly contagious coronavirus, which has infected more than 8.36 million people worldwide and led to 447,985 deaths.  Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands last week said that they had acquired 400 million potential vaccine doses - in principle available to all member states - from British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which is developing a COVID-19 shot in conjunction with Oxford University.  AstraZeneca signed a similar deal in May with the United States.  DEAL IMMINENT?  The health official source said the EU deal with Johnson & Johnson could be announced as early as next week, but cautioned that it might take a little longer to finalise and there is a chance it might not be struck at all.  He said the EU is also seeking a deal with French vaccine-maker Sanofi. A spokesman for Sanofi had no immediate comment.  EU decision-making procedures pose a potential sticking point, with member states still in talks over the establishment of a steering board for vaccine negotiations with drugmakers, officials told Reuters.  But underlining the urgency of securing a vaccine for the EU\u2019s 450 million population, the Commission had already begun talks with Johnson & Johnson even before the steering board has been agreed.  The Netherlands has also been involved in these initial talks with Johnson & Johnson, as a representative of the alliance of the four EU countries that struck the AstraZeneca deal, officials told Reuters.  This alliance is expected to halt negotiations with drugmakers once the EU has appointed its negotiation team, to avoid competition among EU states, officials said.  \u201cJohnson and Johnson\u2019s vaccine is one of the promising initiatives,\u201d a spokesman for the Dutch health ministry said, declining to comment on the ongoing talks.  By buying vaccines under development, the EU risks acquiring shots that may eventually prove unsuccessful against COVID-19.  But the risk is justified by the need to secure enough doses for the EU population in the global race for an effective vaccine, EU officials say.

The Johnson & Johnson logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  While J&J\u2019s pharmaceuticals unit has in recent years cushioned the impact of relatively slow growth in the company\u2019s medical device and consumer units, some of its older drugs have been hurt by competition from cheaper copies.  \u201cWe expect the largest impacts from generics and biosimilars for the year in our pharmaceutical business to occur in the third quarter,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said on a conference call.  Once a drug begins facing competition from multiple generic versions, it can quickly lose more than 80% of sales.  Sales of prostate cancer treatment Zytiga fell 23% in the quarter, hurt by generic copies, and sales of J&J\u2019s blockbuster arthritis drug Remicade fell 16%, impacted by biosimilar rivals.  Also weighing on the stock was the company\u2019s decision to not raise its full-year earnings forecast, even as sales across all its business units largely beat analysts\u2019 estimates.  \u201cWe expect questions on the maintained earnings per share guidance but we point to the continued-to-be-improving strength across its franchises despite pharma headwinds,\u201d said BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch.  Pharmaceutical sales in the quarter rose 1.7% to $10.53 billion, above analysts\u2019 estimates of $10.27 billion, according to three analysts polled by Refinitiv.  (For a graphic on 'J&J's newer drugs fuel pharmaceuticals unit sales' click tmsnrt.rs\/2kbwYl2)  The company raised its 2019 forecast for operational sales, which excludes the impact of currency fluctuations, to a range of $82.4 billion to $83.2 billion, from a prior range of $82 billion to $82.8 billion.  J&J took a $190 million charge in the quarter related to litigation over its talc products. Executives on the conference call said this only related to defense costs and did not include liability payments.  The company faces lawsuits here involving over 14,000 plaintiffs who allege use of its talc products, including Baby Powder, caused cancer here. J&J repeatedly has claimed its talc products are safe and that decades of studies have shown them to be asbestos-free and that they do not cause cancer.

The company expects results of the Phase III trial by year end or early next year, Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J\u2019s chief scientific officer, said in a joint news conference with officials from the National Institutes of Health and the Trump administration.  J&J plans to manufacture as many as 1 billion doses in 2021, and more after that, Stoffels said.  Rival vaccines from Moderna Inc MRNA.O, Pfizer Inc PFE.N and AstraZeneca AZN.L all require two shots separated by several weeks, which make them more difficult to administer and means twice as much vaccine is needed to inoculate the same number of people.  \u201cThe benefits of a single-shot vaccine are potentially profound in terms of mass immunization campaigns and global pandemic control,\u201d Dr. Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher who helped design J&J\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, said in a telephone interview.  The J&J vaccine also does not need to be stored at extremely cold temperatures, Barouch noted, another advantage over some rival vaccine candidates.  J&J shares were up 1.2%.  \u201cBig news. Numerous great companies are seeing fantastic results. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) must move quickly,\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet.  J&J published a detailed study protocol for its Phase III trial on Wednesday on the company\u2019s website, joining the three other vaccine makers that have made these details available in recent weeks after calls for increased transparency in the trials.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  PROTECTION \u2018FOR A LONG TIME\u2019  Stoffels said J&J started the late-stage study after seeing positive results in its combined Phase I\/II trial in the United States and Belgium. The company plans to release those results imminently.  Stoffels said the safety and level of protection demonstrated in the earlier trial were on par with what was seen in the company\u2019s animal studies. The results showed a single dose could offer sufficient protection \u201cfor a long time,\u201d he said.  J&J\u2019s late-stage trial will be conducted at as many as 215 sites in the United States, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.  The trial will assess whether the vaccine can prevent moderate to severe COVID-19 after a single dose. It will also seek to detect if the vaccine can prevent serious disease requiring medical intervention and whether it can prevent milder cases of the virus.  Stoffels said it likely will take six weeks to two months to fully enroll the trial.  J&J plans to manufacture doses before approval, so it will be ready to start distribution soon after an FDA green light.  The trial will be overseen by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that will review vaccine safety and effectiveness at pre-set intervals.  Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said all three vaccines being supported by the federal government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed - J&J\u2019s, Moderna\u2019s and AstraZeneca\u2019s - share a common DSMB. Pfizer is running its own trial and has a separate DSMB, Collins said.  J&J\u2019s trial would be considered a success if it proves to be 60% effective, with a study protocol that could have an efficacy answer after 154 people became infected with the virus.  Stoffels said the company will start counting COVID-19 infections within the study population 15 days after individuals are vaccinated.  The DSMB will take its first look at the vaccine\u2019s efficacy after 20 trial participants have become infected.  Collins said the DSMB does not include any government employees and is made up of \u201cvery highly experienced\u201d scientists and statistical experts.  \u201cUntil they are convinced that there\u2019s something there that looks promising, nothing is unblinded and sent to the FDA. So everybody should feel pretty reassured,\u201d Collins said.  His comments follow concerns that government scientists may be pressured to rush the vaccine testing process to boost U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election bid.  In August, J&J signed an agreement with the British government on a global Phase III clinical trial to study a two-dose version of its vaccine, which will run in parallel with the single-dose trial.  Stoffels, in the briefing, said the single-dose version would be \u201cvery important for emergency use.\u201d The company will later test a booster dose that could produce even greater immunity to the virus, he added.","31":"NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Wall Street\u2019s three major indexes slumped on Friday as weak data from China and Europe stoked fears of a global economic slowdown, while Johnson & Johnson was a major drag on the S&P 500 and Dow after Reuters reported the company had known knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its Baby Powder.

FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The verdict of liability in Middlesex County Superior Court in New Brunswick came as J&J fights thousands of cases claiming its talc products can also cause ovarian cancer. The jury found J&J and another company liable after more than two months of trial.  The lawsuit was brought by New Jersey resident Stephen Lanzo, who said he developed mesothelioma after inhaling dust that was generated through his regular use of J&J talc powder products since his birth in 1972.  Mesothelioma is a deadly form of cancer closely associated with exposure to asbestos. It affects the delicate tissue that lines body cavities, most often around the lungs, but also in the abdomen and elsewhere.  The jury awarded Lanzo $30 million and his wife $7 million in compensatory damages. It found J&J was responsible for 70 percent of the damages and said a unit of France-based Imerys SA IMTP.PA, its talc supplier, was responsible for 30 percent.  The jury will return on Tuesday for further proceedings to determine whether to award punitive damages, according to an online broadcast of the trial by Courtroom View Network.  J&J denied the allegations and says Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder does not contain asbestos or cause cancer.  J&J in a statement said it was disappointed but would withhold further comment until the trial\u2019s completion. Gwen Myers, an Imerys spokeswoman, said Imerys plans to appeal and is confident talc did not cause Lanzo\u2019s cancer.  The Lanzos did not respond to requests for comment.  J&J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, faces talc-related lawsuits by 6,610 plaintiffs nationally, largely based on claims it failed to warn women about the risk of developing ovarian cancer by using its products for feminine hygiene.  In five trials in Missouri involving ovarian cancer lawsuits, juries found J&J liable four times and awarded the plaintiffs a total of $307 million. In California, a jury awarded a now-deceased woman $417 million.  But in October, a Missouri appellate court threw out the first verdict there for $72 million and a California judge tossed the $417 million verdict. J&J is seeking to reverse the other verdicts.  Asbestos claims are a more recent challenge for J&J. It won the only other asbestos-related trial in November when a Los Angeles Superior Court jury ruled in its favor.

Failure to enroll the required number of patients in the study and data inconsistencies, including poor patient accounting and missing race and ethnicity data, were identified as violations in the letter to Mentor.  Mentor said it was disappointed with the FDA\u2019s decision to issue a warning letter, even as the company attempted to address post-approval study requirements with the agency.  \u201cDespite multiple attempts to discuss this with FDA, Mentor has not received feedback,\u201d Mentor spokeswoman Mindy Tinsley said in an emailed statement.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The government has faced growing public pressure over their COVID-19 vaccine procurement plans as the country reported its second-highest daily tally of cases on Wednesday.  Pfizer\u2019s two-dose vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, will be enough to cover 10 million people and its shipment is expected in the third quarter of 2021.  \u201cWe are mobilising the entire national capabilities to bring in the shipments within the second quarter,\u201d Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a televised briefing. \u201cThe negotiation is underway.\u201d  Chung said the doses from Janssen - J&J\u2019s pharmaceuticals division - were added from the initial amount for 4 million people to 6 million and will be ready for inoculation from the second quarter.  The Pfizer and Janssen deals are part of a government plan to buy enough doses from four drugmakers and the global COVAX initiative, backed by the World Health Organization, that will allow immunisation of at least 85% of South Korea\u2019s population of 52 million.  The government had already signed a deal with AstraZeneca Plc, which will be shipped as early as January next year, and is in final talks with Moderna Inc to sign a deal in January to secure 20 million doses.  Health authorities will start a public vaccination programme as early as February next year, which will be completed around November, before the start of the flu season, Yang Dong-gyo, a senior official at the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), told a briefing.  The government had allocated an additional 1.3 trillion won ($1.2 billion) to next year\u2019s budget for vaccines.  The KDCA reported 985 new coronavirus cases as of Wednesday midnight, bringing the nation\u2019s tally to 53,533, with 756 deaths.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Addressing a webinar on vaccines, the official, Glenda Gray, said discussions were underway with regulatory authorities to roll out the single-dose vaccine to health workers, after the government on Sunday halted distribution of the AstraZeneca vaccine over efficacy concerns.  In December, the U.S. pharmaceutical company was the first to apply to the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) for registration of its vaccine.  South Africa had given fast-track approval to AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use last month and had said it was reviewing applications by Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.  \u201cJ&J also submitted a rolling submission to SAHPRA to expedite the regulatory processes in South Africa, so this AD26 vaccine as we speak is being processed for emergency use,\u201d Gray said on Tuesday.  AD26 is the clinical name of the J&J vaccine.  She said there has been progress in discussions with regulatory authorities, enough to consider evaluating the vaccine in exposed health care workers, who are the first sector of the 60 million population earmarked for inoculations.  \u201cSo what we are discussing is whether, under regulatory authorisation, we can use this vaccine rapidly in health care workers in South Africa as a single shot,\u201d she said, adding that the vaccine is safe and has shown to work on the South African variant of the novel coronavirus.  South Africa has pivoted to the J&J vaccine after data showed AstraZeneca\u2019s shot offered minimal protection against mild-to-moderate illness from a dominant local virus variant.  With the most coronavirus infections in Africa and more than 46,000 deaths, South Africa had planned to start offering healthcare workers the AstraZeneca vaccine soon before it was put on hold.  Shabir Madhi, the principal investigator of South Africa leg of trials of the vaccine manufactured by AstraZeneca, said human trials for a second generation of vaccines to tackle new variants of the coronavirus are already underway.

But several legal experts said that even though J&J has been successful in winning appeals of other talc cases in Missouri, it will face a challenging road in appealing the verdict handed down on Thursday in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis.  John Beisner, a lawyer for Johnson & Johnson, said, \u201cOne of the hardest things will be prioritizing what to appeal first.\u201d He described to Reuters the company\u2019s jurisdictional and scientific arguments for overturning Thursday\u2019s verdict.  In a statement responding to the verdict, J&J reiterated its position that its products never contained asbestos and were not carcinogenic.  Thursday\u2019s verdict is the largest to date arising from lawsuits alleging talc-based products like J&J\u2019s baby powder have caused cancer. The jury reached its decision in less than a day, following five weeks of expert testimony from both sides.  The stakes are potentially high for J&J, which is facing 9,000 cases nationwide over talc. The company has had previous success in overturning large verdicts in talc cases as well as others alleging harm from its products.  But several legal experts said Missouri courts, including at the appellate and supreme court level, were historically plaintiff-friendly and could prove unreceptive to J&J\u2019s arguments.  \u201cJ&J has strong arguments, but unless they get to certify this case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which are very long odds, this decision is likely to stand,\u201d said Lars Noah, a law professor at the University of Florida.  He said he expected J&J would go through the appeals process but would ultimately wind up settling the case.  Beisner said he was not aware of any interest in settlement. \u201cOur attention will remain focused on the appeals from this and the other trials awaiting review.\u201d  Beisner said jurisdiction will be one major basis for J&J to appeal Thursday\u2019s verdict. Most of the 22 plaintiffs were not Missouri residents, and he said they should not have been allowed to sue New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson in St. Louis under a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that severely restricted state courts\u2019 jurisdiction over injury lawsuits brought by non-residents against out-of-state companies.  FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  J&J seized on that decision to successfully overturn previous talc verdicts in Missouri.  Mark Lanier, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer who won Thursday\u2019s verdict, said he was ready for that argument.  Lanier said his team amassed \u201chundreds of pages of evidence\u201d showing lobbying efforts and baby powder focus groups J&J conducted in the state. He also spotlighted the claim by 15 of his non-resident clients that they used a specific short-lived J&J talc-based product manufactured by Missouri-based contractor.  \u201cI hope they focus their appeal on jurisdiction because I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll win that,\u201d Lanier said. He did say that he expects the punitive damages award to be halved during the appeals process due to a Missouri state law that caps such damages, but is confident the verdict would stand overall.  The $4.69 billion in total damages includes $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages.  Elizabeth Burch, a law professor at the University of Georgia, said that even under the new Supreme Court guidance, the women\u2019s claim that they used the specific product, if true, provided \u201ca pretty strong link to Missouri.\u201d  At trial J&J had unsuccessfully sought to cast doubt on the 15 women\u2019s claims to have used the same product that was only available for a few months, depicting it as a ruse designed to bypass the jurisdiction issue. Beisner said J&J would make the same argument on appeal.  Along with jurisdictional arguments, Beisner said the company would continue to put forth its case that scientific studies overwhelmingly show talc itself is safe and the company\u2019s talc-based products never contained asbestos.  \u201cNone of plaintiffs\u2019 experts were able to put forward a valid theory and there is simply no science to support what they call asbestos in the product,\u201d said Beisner.  J&J says decades of testing by laboratories and independent agencies, including a study by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, support its position. The company said plaintiffs\u2019 tests showing asbestos contamination were \u201cjunk science.\u201d  But Lanier argued that it was the agencies and labs cited by J&J that used flawed testing methods that failed to detect asbestos.  Noah said Missouri judges have historically applied a lower standard than federal court for admitting scientific evidence. Last year the state passed a law requiring its courts to adopt the federal standard, but he said state courts would be interpreting that requirement for years to come.  \u201cMissouri judges aren\u2019t going to suddenly change their tune,\u201d Noah said.","43":"An Oklahoma judge on Monday cleared the way for Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd to face trial at the end of May in a lawsuit by the state\u2019s attorney general accusing the drugmakers of helping fuel the opioid epidemic.

Read the Reuters investigation reut.rs\/2rAz2TO  The company said on Wednesday that Indian drug authorities visited some of its facilities and took \u201ctests and samples\u201d of its talcum powder. It also said that the safety of its cosmetic talc was based on a long history of safe use and decades of research and clinical evidence by independent researchers and scientific review boards across the world.  The CDSCO also collected samples of the company\u2019s baby shampoo and soap products as a matter of routine, the official said.  \u201cWhenever inspectors feel there is contamination in one thing they also take samples of (other products) from the same company,\u201d the official said.  The visits came as the CDSCO and state-based food and drug administrations launched an investigation into J&J\u2019s Baby Powder following a Reuters report last Friday that the firm knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos could be found in the product. J&J has described the Reuters article as \u201cone-sided, false and inflammatory\u201d.  The company told Reuters that it is in full compliance with the current Indian regulatory requirements for the manufacturing and testing of its talc.  \u201cAll talc in India is sourced and exclusively sold in India and surrounding markets \u2013 including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives \u2013 and fully meets the regulatory standards of the Government of India,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.  J&J also said its talc is routinely tested by both suppliers and independent labs to ensure that it is free of asbestos.  Asked if the order meant the company would have to stop producing its ubiquitous Baby Powder in India for now, the official at the drugs regulator said that was \u201cthe inference you have to take\u201d at least as far as the stores of raw materials were concerned.  \u201cWe have told them until this investigation concludes, you should not use the raw material. Test results will take time,\u201d the official said. \u201cTesting for asbestos is not a routine procedure. It might be in traces. It will require us to develop a method and all those things.\u201d  FAMILIAR BRAND  J&J\u2019s Baby Powder is one of the most recognized foreign brands in India.  The company started selling its Baby Powder in India in 1948, just a year after the country won independence from Britain. Presenting gift boxes containing the product and others aimed at newborns is almost a family ritual in this country of 1.3 billion people, 28 percent of whom are aged 0-14.  The company also commands a strong retail distribution network through small pharmacies, larger stores and the internet.  There is yet to be any significant signs of a backlash against J&J products in India. At eight pharmacies across India visited by Reuters reporters on Thursday, seven said J&J remained the No. 1 seller of powder for babies.  That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t under pressure from local and international competitors who sell talc-type powders, such as Bengaluru-based Himalaya Herbals, and Italy\u2019s Artsana, which produces Chicco baby brands.  And some individual consumers say they are now very wary of J&J\u2019s Baby Powder.  \u201cIt is really very, very shocking,\u201d said Sitaram Beria, a chartered accountant in the eastern city of Bhubaneswar. He said he stopped applying J&J powder to his six-month old baby after hearing about the Reuters report over the weekend.  J&J leads sales in the Indian baby and child toiletries market, which market research provider Euromonitor estimates would be worth 12.5 billion rupees ($178 million) this year, and forecasts will grow 84 percent to 23 billion rupees in 2022.  Euromonitor did not give a breakdown for baby powder alone but said J&J was the biggest player in the overall segment, followed by Mumbai-based VVF Ltd, Artsana, Wipro of Bengaluru and Himalaya.  Himalaya said in a statement that its herbs-based baby care products \u201care exclusively promoted and recommended by over 40,000 doctors in the country, which is the greatest endorsement for us,\u201d while declining to provide any financial figures.  The other companies could not be reached for comment.","47":"(Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L has resumed the U.S. trial of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine after approval by regulators, and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N is preparing to resume its trial on Monday or Tuesday, the companies said on Friday.  The news signaled progress against the novel coronavirus that has infected more than 41 million globally, including 8 million Americans and comes 10 days before a U.S. presidential election that may hinge on plans here to fight the pandemic.  AstraZeneca, one of the leading vaccine developers, paused its U.S. trial on Sept. 6 after a report of a serious neurological illness, believed to be transverse myelitis, in a participant in the company\u2019s UK trial. J&J paused its large, late-stage trial last week after a study participant became ill.  Both companies have contracts to provide vaccine to the United States and other governments if they are cleared by regulators.  Officials and experts have expressed concern that the regulatory approval process overseen by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be undermined by political pressure, and around a quarter of Americans say they are hesitant to take a COVID-19 vaccine.  \u201cAs this trial resumes, I am hoping the message communicated to the public is that we are following procedures to highest ethical standard and not interfering with the FDA regulatory process,\u201d said Matthew Hepburn, head of vaccine development for Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership to speed inoculation efforts.  Infections are rising in 80 countries here as people in the northern hemisphere spend more time indoors with winter approaching.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  J&J said on Friday that the safety panel, called a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, has recommended that the drugmaker resume trial recruitment after finding no evidence that the vaccine caused the volunteer to fall ill.  J&J expects to resume its trial in the United States on Monday or Tuesday and remains on track to produce data from the trial on the vaccines\u2019 effectiveness by the end of 2020 or early 2021, J&J\u2019s chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels said.  J&J is also in discussions with other regulators to resume a trial outside of the United States, the company said.  So far, the medical board has not identified a clear cause for the patients\u2019 illness. J&J cannot reveal any details about the patient\u2019s sickness because of patient privacy rules, Stoffels said.  AstraZeneca said that it is not unusual for some trial participants to fall ill during large scale vaccine trials but that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reviewed all safety data from the trials globally and deemed it safe to continue testing the vaccine.  AstraZeneca trials in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa resumed last month even as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continued its investigation into the case.  Reuters earlier this week reported that the FDA had completed its review and that the AstraZeneca U.S. trial was set to resume as early as this week, citing four sources familiar with the situation.  AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine is being developed along with researchers at Oxford University.","48":"A Pennsylvania appeals court has rejected Johnson & Johnson\u2019s bid to preserve one of only two jury verdicts in the state that have gone in its favor in lawsuits by women alleging that the company\u2019s defective pelvic mesh implants injured them.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Britain and the United States are in the lead with six vaccine deals with drugmakers each, as companies and governments worldwide work overtime to find a vaccine against the pandemic disease.  The latest agreements bring Britain\u2019s total number of doses secured to 340 million, with options for millions more, for a population of 66 million.  Britain said both vaccines could be available by the middle of next year for priority groups, such as such as frontline health and social care workers, ethnic minorities, adults with serious diseases, and the elderly.  The deals cover a wide range of vaccine types currently in development for COVID-19, as Britain seeks to hedge its bets should one or more of the technologies prove ineffective.  \u201cFor now that is probably the bedrock of the portfolio. We basically need to see now, what we want to add, if anything, immediately that could diversify the sorts of vaccine that we\u2019ve got in the hopper now,\u201d Kate Bingham, chair of UK Vaccine Taskforce, told Reuters.  \u201cI think we\u2019re well placed... but I think we need to see the data of some of these early vaccines first before we know what is likely to be protective and what is not.\u201d  Johnson & Johnson said its Janssen Pharmaceutica unit will supply Britain with its candidate, known as Ad26.COV2.S, with an initial sale of 30 million doses on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use.  The advance purchase agreement will also provide an option for an additional purchase of up to a 22 million doses, it said.  Separately, Novavax said Britain would buy 60 million doses of its vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373. Novavax will manufacture some of the vaccine using Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies facilities in Stockton-on-Tees, northern England.  Alex Harris, head of global policy at the Wellcome Trust health charity, said the deals put the Britain in a strong position, and urged the government to explain how it will now ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for poorer countries too.  \u201cWithout this...the risk increases that other rich countries will seek to strike similar bilateral deals, potentially ... leaving insufficient volumes of vaccine for the rest of the world,\u201d Harris said in a statement.  The Janssen vaccine uses an adenovirus technique to ferry coronavirus proteins into cells in the body, while the Novavax shot uses a technology known as recombinant nanoparticle to produce antigens - molecules that are designed to spur the immune system into action.  Recent studies show the odds of an experimental vaccine making it from early testing in people to regulatory approval are roughly one in three.  J&J said it has also agreed to collaborate with the British government on a global Phase III trial to explore the two-dose regimen of its COVID-19 vaccine, which will run parallel to a Phase III single-dose trials. Britain will also work with Novavax on a late stage British-based trial.

Wall Street\u2019s main indexes erased losses from the start of the session to trade solidly positive.  In written testimony, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the economy was on the cusp of \u201cseveral years\u201d of the job market remaining strong and inflation remaining around the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target.  Assets reacted modestly for the most part following Powell\u2019s prepared remarks, in which he signalled he believed the economy was doing well and that an era of stable growth may continue, provided the Fed gets its policy decisions right.  The U.S. dollar pared gains immediately following the release of the testimony, but then quickly bounced back and added to gains.  \u201cHe reiterated the view of the economy as being strong, growing at a solid pace with recent inflation data as more or less encouraging,\u201d said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 63.79 points, or 0.25 percent, to 25,128.15, the S&P 500 gained 12.88 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,811.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 50.77 points, or 0.65 percent, to 7,856.49.  As a busy week of corporate earnings began, Netflix Inc shares dropped 4.9 percent after the company\u2019s subscriber growth fell short of Wall Street expectations, while Johnson & Johnson shares gained 3.5 percent, boosting the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials, after the healthcare company\u2019s results topped estimates.

The dollar index, tracking it against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.52 percent, with the euro down 0.47 percent to $1.1654.

Lawyers for the state, including Attorney General Mike Hunter, told a judge in Norman, Oklahoma that J&J\u2019s \u201cgreed\u201d led the drugmaker to carry out a years-long marketing effort that caused \u201cutter confusion\u201d about the addictive painkillers\u2019 risks.  Brad Beckworth, a lawyer for the state, in his closing argument said J&J knew opioids were harmful, yet minimized their risk of addiction, resulting in a surge in overdose deaths as doctors overprescribed the drugs and they flooded the state.  \u201cThey didn\u2019t get here from a Mexican cartel,\u201d Beckworth said. \u201cThey got here from the pharmaceutical cartel, and the kingpin of them all is Johnson & Johnson.\u201d  Hunter, who sued J&J in 2017, said the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company does not dispute the crisis exists, yet \u201cthey blame everyone but themselves.\u201d  The state urged Judge Thad Balkman, who presided over the nonjury trial for six weeks, to find J&J liable for creating a public nuisance and force it to pay up to $17 billion over 30 years to address the epidemic.  J&J denies causing the epidemic. Its lawyers have argued that its products made up a small share of opioids prescribed in Oklahoma and carried U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved labels that warned of the addictive risks.  The case is one of around 2,000 actions by state and local governments accusing drug manufacturers of contributing to the opioid epidemic. Opioids were linked to a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The Oklahoma case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in other opioid lawsuits, particularly in 1,900 cases pending before a federal judge in Ohio who has been pushing for a settlement ahead of an October trial.  At trial, lawyers for Oklahoma argued that J&J, which sold the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, had since the 1990s marketed opioids as \u201csafe and effective for everyday pain\u201d while downplaying their addictive qualities.  Purdue and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd were originally also defendants in the case. Purdue reached a $270 million settlement with the state in March and Teva settled for $85 million in June. Both deny wrongdoing.

COVAX, a global scheme co-led by the WHO, wants to deliver at least 2 billion COVID-19 doses across the world this year, with at least 1.3 billion going to poorer countries.  But it has so far struggled to secure enough shots due to a shortage of funds, while wealthy nations have booked large volumes of vaccines for themselves.  In the race to deploy shots, regulatory approvals are key to confirming the effectiveness and safety of vaccines, and to boosting output. But some poorer countries rely mostly on WHO authorisations as they have limited regulatory capacity.  The WHO is therefore \u201cexpediting\u201d emergency approvals, according to a COVAX internal document, which cites data updated to Jan. 7.  The COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) could be authorised by the WHO in January or February, the document says.  The same vaccine produced in South Korea by SK Bioscience could be approved by the U.N. agency at the end of February, at the earliest, the document says.  As well as vaccines, regulators usually authorise their manufacturing processes in different plants.  SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla told Reuters last week he expected WHO approval \u201cin the next week or two\u201d.  AstraZeneca and the WHO did not respond to requests for comment.  SK said it was not aware of the WHO\u2019s approval timeline.  The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Oxford University, has already been given emergency approval in Britain, while decisions in the European Union and the United States are close.  COVAX has supply contracts with AstraZeneca and SII for about 400 million doses and a non-binding deal for many more hundreds of millions, although the timing of possible deliveries is uncertain.  OTHER WESTERN SHOTS  The WHO authorised the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech at the end of December.  WHO officials have said they are seeking a supply deal with the U.S. pharmaceutical giant, which has already committed hundreds of millions of doses this year to several wealthy nations.  COVAX had not initially included the Pfizer\/BioNTech shot in its shortlist for advance purchases.  Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment on whether a deal was close and whether it would involve only a limited number of doses this year.  The COVAX document also shows the WHO is expected to approve Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, which is based on the same messenger RNA (mRNA) technology as Pfizer\u2019s, at the end of February.  Moderna, whose vaccine is already approved in many Western countries including in the United States and the European Union, had no immediate comment.  The vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson (J&J), which has a non-binding agreement to supply COVAX with 500 million doses over an unspecified timeframe, is expected to get WHO approval in May or June at the earliest, the COVAX document says.  J&J has not yet published results of its vaccine\u2019s Phase III clinical trials, but the EU has said it expects the company to apply for approval as early as February.  A J&J spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.  CHINA AND RUSSIA  The WHO is also considering possible quick approvals for two Chinese vaccines, the document shows.  Sinopharm and Sinovac have filed their applications with the WHO, which is reviewing them and could make decisions on both in March at the earliest, it says.  Neither vaccine was shortlisted by the WHO for possible advance purchase deals. WHO approval does not automatically lead to purchases by COVAX. It could also facilitate the rollout in poorer countries that acquire the vaccines directly.  Sinopharm has filed applications for two COVID-19 vaccines, but the possible March approval concerns only the one developed by its Beijing-based affiliate, Beijing Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd (BIBP), which has already been widely used for inoculations in China.  Sinovac has yet to release global results of its Phase III trials, but its vaccine has been approved for emergency use in countries including Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey.  Sinopharm and Sinovac did not respond to requests for comment.  There is no provisional timetable yet for the possible approval of Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine, despite its developers having filed the relevant documentation, the document shows.  The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the main financial backer of Sputnik V, did not respond to a request for comment.

J&J said it submitted two marketing authorization applications to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for its vaccine regimen targeting the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus, which most commonly causes outbreaks of the deadly disease.  The company's vaccine requires two injections administered about eight weeks apart, the first developed using J&J's technology and the second from Denmark-based biotech Bavarian Nordic A\/S BAVA.CO.  Johnson & Johnson\u2019s applications are supported by data from over 10 studies that have tested the regimen in adults and children, the company said.  The drugmaker added it was discussing with the Food and Drug Administration the dataset that would be required for U.S. approval.  Since it first started in August 2018, the Ebola outbreak has killed more than 2,000 people, second only to the 2013-16 outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,300.  The EMA\u2019s recommendation for approval in October of Merck\u2019s Ebola vaccine, taken as a single shot, was hailed by the World Health Organization as a \u201ctriumph for public health\u201d that could save many lives.

Some analysts said Tuesday\u2019s pullback in stock markets was not indicative of a deeper aversion to risk, given that many investors are convinced that there is more fiscal stimulus to come in the United States.  Still, the dip in stock markets was accompanied by firmer demand for traditional safe-haven assets such as the dollar and government bonds. A stronger dollar in turn weighed on gold prices.  Trade data from China released overnight that suggested the world\u2019s second-largest economy was rebounding was mostly brushed aside by stock and bond markets, though it boosted oil prices as investors hoped for a slow recovery in energy demand.  The S&P 500 fell 23.5 points, or 0.65%, to 3,511.20, but still within sight its record high of 3,580.84 struck on Sept. 2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 139.8 points, or 0.48%, to 28,699.30. The Nasdaq Composite erased earlier gains to slip 36.3 points, or 0.3%, to 11,842.03 points.  Shares in Johnson & Johnson sagged 2.6% as investors digested news that a participant in its COVID-19 vaccine trial had fallen ill and that it would take the company at least a few days to evaluate the situation.  Investors see the quick introduction of a vaccine as key to helping economies recover. J&J\u2019s news comes after its rival AstraZeneca, which uses a similar technology, paused the trial of its experimental vaccine in September due to a participant\u2019s unexplained illness.  \u201cMarkets have already priced in perfection,\u201d said Ken Polcari, chief market strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news.\u2019\u201d  European shares also struggled as investors found a reason in news of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s delayed trial to take profits.  The Euro STOXX 600 lost 0.77%, ending three straight days of gains, with markets in Frankfurt, London and Paris mirroring its moves.  The sentiment in European and U.S. equities defied earlier resilience in Asia, where Chinese shares got a lift from data that showed exports rising 9.9% in September and imports swinging to a 13.2% gain, versus a 2.1% drop in August.  The data suggested Chinese exporters were recovering from the pandemic\u2019s damage to overseas orders and helped Chinese blue-chip shares rise 0.33%. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, however, trimmed earlier gains and was little changed by the end of Tuesday.  The overall subdued mood in stock markets contrasted with the dollar, which is on track for its best daily performance in three weeks, as the dollar index climbed 0.54% against a basket of other currencies to 93.546.  The Australian dollar, on the other hand, was slugged by news that Beijing has stopped taking shipments of Australian coal. The Aussie dropped as much as 0.76% to $0.7152 .  Government bond yields mostly fell as demand for safe-haven bonds firmed.  The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield retreated to 0.7289%, a low not seen since Aug. 4.  Government bond yields in the euro zone also held near recent troughs, with hefty supply failing to dent a market bolstered by expectations for further central bank easing.  Germany\u2019s 10-year Bund yield touched -0.538%, its lowest in just over a week. Italian and Greek benchmark 10-year debt both hit record lows.  A stronger dollar capped gold prices, which dropped 1.5% to $1,893.01 per ounce.  Benefiting from China\u2019s promising trade data, Brent crude futures were up 73 cents, or 1.75%, to $42.45 a barrel.

After two weeks of trial, the jury in the Darlington County Court of Common Pleas said it could not decide whether J&J was responsible for the disease. Under South Carolina law, a jury has to make a unanimous decision.  Christopher Swett, a lawyer for the family of Boyd-Bostic, said in a statement that the plaintiffs would retry the case at the earliest opportunity.  \u201cWe continue to believe that the daily use of baby powder on Bertila from birth led to her death,\u201d Swett said.  The case also named as a defendant the U.S. unit of talc supplier Imerys SA, as well as a local unit of Rite Aid, one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, which allegedly sold the baby powder used by the woman.  Gwen Myers, a spokeswoman for Imerys Talc America, said: \u201cWe remain confident that talc does not cause cancer. Imerys follows all FDA and other regulatory guidelines and utilizes rigorous testing to ensure that our talc meets the highest quality standards. We continue to stand by the safety of our product.\u201d  Rite Aid did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  J&J is battling some 9,000 cases claiming its talc products cause ovarian cancer, but litigants have recently focused on claims based on alleged asbestos contamination.  A California jury on Thursday awarded $25.7 million in damages to a woman and her husband over allegations that the company\u2019s baby powder had caused her mesothelioma.  A New Jersey court jury in April ordered J&J and Imerys Talc America to pay $117 million to a man who alleged he developed mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure from talc-based products.  The company won the only other asbestos-related trial in November, when a Los Angeles Superior Court jury ruled in its favor.","71":"Jan 26 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson:  * JOHNSON & JOHNSON CEO EXPECTS TO SHARE DETAILS FROM TRIAL OF COVID-19 VACCINE EARLY NEXT WEEK: CONF.

Platinum has given J&J until mid-June to accept the offer to allow for consultations with overseas workers.  Sales at J&J\u2019s diabetes device business, which also includes Animas Corp and Calibra Medical Inc, have been falling since 2012 in a highly competitive market and the company said last January that it was evaluating options for the units.

Reuters had reported in January that Chinese buyers were interested in paying $3 billion to $4 billion for the companies.  Cowen analyst Joshua Jennings said in a research note that the LifeScan valuation was reasonable given that the business was declining and facing continued pricing pressure.

The move by Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter came ahead of an upcoming May 28 trial, the first in the United States to result from roughly 2,000 lawsuits seeking to hold manufacturers of painkillers responsible for contributing to the epidemic.  Opioids were involved in a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017 in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Hunter dropped the claims after announcing last week that OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP had along with the wealthy Sackler family who own it reached a $270 million settlement.  The 2017 lawsuit accused the three companies of engaging in deceptive marketing that downplayed the addiction risk from opioids while overstating their benefits. The Sacklers were not defendants in the case. The companies deny wrongdoing.  Hunter said he would continue to bring a public nuisance claim against J&J and Teva but was dropping five other claims, including that they violated the Oklahoma Medicaid False Claims Act.  Hunter said dropping those claims would not impact the amount of damages the state is seeking. Hunter had been asking for more than $20 billion before Purdue\u2019s settlement.  J&J in a statement said the state\u2019s decision to drop most of its claims \u201cunderscores their lack of merit.\u201d It said the evidence at trial will show that the company appropriately marketed its pain medications.  Teva did not respond to a request for comment.  Hunter said the decision to refocus the case around the single claim that the companies caused a public nuisance that needs remediated will obviate efforts by the companies to delay the upcoming trial.  It will also transform what was to be a televised jury trial into a non-jury one in which a state court judge will decide the case, Hunter said.  \u201cThe team and I remain laser focused on the goal we set since filing this lawsuit: holding those responsible for creating this crisis accountable and bring an end to the opioid epidemic in Oklahoma,\u201d Hunter said.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered makers of all implants to immediately stop their sale and distribution amid claims that they caused pain, perforations, urinary problems, bleeding and other serious injuries.  J&J in 2012 stopped selling mesh implants for pelvic organ prolapse, though it continues to market devices for use in treating incontinence.

With the next Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for September, investors are gauging the strength of the U.S. economy for clues on where rates are headed.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.76 points, or 0.01%, to 25,896.07, the S&P 500 gained 0.88 points, or 0.03%, to 2,879.26 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.82 points, or 0.04%, to 7,850.92.  Offering markets support was a 0.23% rise in the healthcare sector, powered by gains in Johnson & Johnson.  Shares in the drugmaker rose 2.22% after an Oklahoma judge said J&J must pay $572.1 million for its part in fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic, a sum that was substantially less than what investors had expected.  Philip Morris International Inc shares dropped 3.6%, after the tobacco maker said it is in talks with Altria Group Inc to combine in an all-stock merger of equals. Altria\u2019s shares were off 1.1%.  Shares in J. M. Smucker Co tumbled 9.3% after the packaged food maker cut its full-year earnings forecast and missed estimates for quarterly profit and sales.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.20-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.82-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 25 new 52-week highs and 15 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 33 new highs and 123 new lows.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/Illustration\/File Photo  Imerys Talc America, the U.S. unit of French group Imerys SA, said it filed for bankruptcy because it lacks the financial clout to defend against nearly 15,000 lawsuits over its talc mineral product.  Imerys said that while it continued to believe the lawsuits are without merit, the prospect of rising settlement and defense costs over the next few years prompted the decision to file for bankruptcy.  They also cite a multibillion-dollar verdict against Johnson & Johnson and the ensuing media attention as factors that led to the Chapter 11 filing.  In July, a Missouri jury ordered J&J to pay a record $4.69 billion to 22 women who said asbestos in talc caused ovarian cancer. The healthcare conglomerate has said it is appealing that verdict.  Imerys settled for an undisclosed amount prior to the trial.  Imerys and J&J have repeatedly denied the allegations, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown their talc to be safe.  J&J on Wednesday declined to comment on Imerys Talc America\u2019s Chapter 11 filing.  Reuters on Dec. 14 published a report detailing that J&J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results it did not disclose to regulators or consumers.  J&J has said that its talc products do not contain asbestos.  Bankruptcy provides Imerys a single forum to settle the widespread litigation. A similar strategy has been used by numerous companies facing litigation over faulty breast implants, asbestos-tainted products and recalled automotive airbags.  \u201cAfter carefully evaluating all possible options, we determined that pursuing Chapter 11 protection is the best course of action to address our historic talc-related liabilities and position the filing companies for continued growth,\u201d Imerys Talc America said in a statement.  Two North American subsidiaries of Imerys, Imerys Talc Vermont and Imerys Talc Canada, also filed for Chapter 11 on Wednesday.  Mark Lanier, a Texas-based lawyer representing many of the more than 11,700 talc plaintiffs, on Wednesday said Imerys Talc America\u2019s bankruptcy would not change the litigation.  \u201cWe have always targeted our cases against J&J and Colgate Palmolive, the companies that put the asbestos laced talc into the products,\u201d Lanier said.  Colgate-Palmolive is another defendant in the U.S. talc litigation. The New York-based company sold Cashmere Bouquet, a cosmetic talcum powder, from 1871 to 1995.

The J&J vaccine is not yet authorised for use in South Africa, although the U.S. company has initiated a \u201crolling submission\u201d with local regulator SAHPRA.  Pillay said the J&J vaccine had shown in trials to be highly effective in preventing hospitalisation and death, and said it was an advantage that it was a one-shot vaccine that could be stored at fridge temperatures.  \u201cSo we think it will be a good vaccine at this point in time for South Africa,\u201d he said.

The trial did not assess the vaccine\u2019s efficacy against severe infection, and its findings have not yet been peer-reviewed.  AstraZeneca, which developed the vaccine with Oxford University, says it believes its vaccine can protect against severe disease and has already started adapting it against the 501Y.V2 variant.  Asked whether the sample size of the AstraZeneca trial was large enough to draw conclusions from, Pillay said: \u201cI don\u2019t think we can be confident to say the vaccine doesn\u2019t work, but we also don\u2019t have the data to say it certainly will work. What we have are potential indicators.\u201d  He said the government needed a \u201cbroader discussion\u201d with local and global scientists to interpret the trial data and say what the best way forward would be.

In the trial of nearly 44,000 volunteers, the level of protection against moderate and severe COVID-19 was 66% in Latin America and just 57% in South Africa, where a particularly worrying variant of the novel coronavirus is circulating.  Those results compare to the high bar set by two authorized vaccines from Pfizer Inc\/BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc, which were around 95% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in pivotal trials when given in two doses. Those trials, however, were conducted mainly in the United States and before the broad spread of new variants now under the spotlight.  J&J\u2019s main study goal was the prevention of moderate to severe COVID-19, and the vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization across all geographies and against multiple variants 28 days after immunization.  That level of prevention \u201cwill potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of COVID-19,\u201d Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J\u2019s chief scientific officer, said in a statement.  The company plans to seek emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration next week.  Public health officials have been counting on the J&J vaccine to increase much-needed supply and simplify the U.S. immunization campaign.  Unlike the Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, J&J\u2019s does not require a second shot weeks after the first or need to be kept frozen, making it a strong candidate for use in parts of the world with weak transportation infrastructure and insufficient cold storage facilities.  SOUTH AFRICA  Several studies have emerged this month showing that a South African variant of the coronavirus has mutated in areas of the virus that are key targets of vaccines, reducing their efficacy.  \u201cWhat we are learning is there is different efficacy in different parts of the world,\u201d Stoffels said in a telephone interview.  Importantly, though, in a sub-study of 6,000 volunteers in South Africa, Stoffels said, the J&J vaccine was 89% effective at preventing severe disease. Ninety-five percent of cases in the South Africa portion of the trial were infections with the South African variant.  A mid-stage trial of a Novovax Inc coronavirus vaccine in South Africa also showed lower efficacy in the country. It proved to be 60% effective among volunteers who didn\u2019t have HIV. In a separate, late-stage trial in the UK, the vaccine was 89.3% effective.  In the J&J trial, which was conducted in eight countries, 44% of participants were from the United States, 41% were from Central and South America and 15% were from South Africa. Slightly more than a third of the volunteers were over age 60.  There were no serious adverse events among those who received the shot, the company said. Full results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.  J&J\u2019s vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26 to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells in the body and trigger an immune response.  The Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use a new technology called messenger RNA (mRNA) that requires it to be stored in a freezer.  VACCINE TARGETS  The news of another safe and effective vaccine comes as the United States has surpassed 430,000 COVID-19 deaths and with hospitals in many states still struggling to keep up with patients despite recent declines in new infections.  Concerns about fresh surges in the United States have also grown due to the presence of a more contagious coronavirus variant first discovered in the UK and news of the arrival of the South African variant on Thursday in South Carolina.  The U.S. vaccination program got off to a slow start in December and has accelerated to around 1 million shots per day nationwide.  U.S. President Joe Biden has promised that at least 100 million shots will be administered in his first 100 days in office, but concerns about supply disruptions have added uncertainty to that target.  The United States has an agreement to buy 100 million doses of J&J\u2019s vaccine for $1 billion. The company said in a statement the vaccine would be ready immediately upon emergency approval but Stoffels declined to specify how many doses. The government also has the option of purchasing an additional 200 million doses.  J&J has said it plans to deliver 1 billion doses in 2021 and will produce the vaccine in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India.  U.S. trial results for the vaccine from AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University are expected in early February, opening up the possibility of a fourth vaccine option. It has already been approved in the UK, Europe and many countries based on results of a separate trial.  Novavax is also discussing with the FDA whether its data is sufficient to apply for emergency use authorization.  J&J is studying the effects of its vaccine given in two doses at two months apart, but results of that trial won\u2019t be available until this summer, Stoffels said.","104":"(Corrects paragraph 6 to remove statement that plaintiffs are barred from offering testimony that talc causes cancer )  NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - Thousands of plaintiffs who say that Johnson & Johnson\u2019s baby powder and talc products caused cancer can go forward with their claims, but face limits on what expert testimony will be allowed in trials after a Monday ruling by a New Jersey judge.  J&J faces more than 16,000-talc related lawsuits nationwide, the majority of which are pending before U.S. District Judge Freda Wolfson in New Jersey. The lawsuits allege that the company\u2019s talc products have been contaminated with asbestos and can cause ovarian cancer.  The company had sought to bar all of the plaintiffs\u2019 experts from testifying, which would have effectively wiped out all the cases before Wolfson.  J&J said in a statement that Monday\u2019s decision \u201cis not a determination by the court on the validity of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations.\u201d It added that all verdicts against the company in talc lawsuits that had gone through the appeals process have been overturned.  The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company denies that its talc causes cancer, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free.  The ruling by Wolfson will allow plaintiffs to present expert testimony that J&J\u2019s talc products can cause cancer based on epidemiological studies. They will be allowed to testify that the link could be caused by contamination with asbestos and heavy metals.  Wolfson also ruled that the plaintiffs\u2019 experts cannot testify that inhaling talc can travel to the ovaries if inhaled, though they may say that it can reach the ovaries when used vaginally.  In so-called multidistrict litigations like the one before Wolfson, in which thousands of lawsuits are consolidated, a handful of cases are designated for early \u201cbellwether\u201d trials, which can help determine the strength of each side\u2019s case and aid in settlement. Testimony in such cases typically relies heavily on experts.  Several lawsuits against J&J over talc in state courts around the country have already gone to trial, including one in St. Louis, Missouri, involving 22 plaintiffs that produced a record $4.69 billion talc verdict against J&J in July 2018. The company is appealing the verdict.  In addition to the civil litigation, J&J faces a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about its talc products\u2019 safety.

The company\u2019s prostate cancer drug Zytiga, an important growth driver, is expected to be pressured by generic competition, while sales of its rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade has been slipping due to competition from cheaper biosimilar versions.  The company said it expects full-year sales in the range of $80.4 billion to $81.2 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $82.69 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  In the fourth-quarter, sales rose about 1 percent to $20.39 billion, topping the average Wall Street estimate of $20.20 billion, helped by double-digit percentage growth in sales of Crohn\u2019s disease treatment Stelara and cancer drugs such as Darzalex and Imbruvica.  Strength in the company\u2019s pharmaceuticals business also offset higher costs. In the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company\u2019s litigation expense doubled to $1.29 billion. J&J did not provide a specific reason for the surge in litigation costs and a spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.  The healthcare company is facing more than 11,000 lawsuits over the safety of talc in its products, including baby powder, alleging that its use caused cancer.  Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report detailing that the company knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos could be found in the product.  J&J has repeatedly defended the safety of its talc products, saying that decades of studies have shown them be asbestos-free and that they do not cause cancer.  Darzalex and Imbruvica sales saw a double-digit rise in sales to $584 million and $703 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter. Sales of Stelara, also used to treat psoriasis, rose 33.6 percent to $1.44 billion.  While J&J has huge medical device and consumer health divisions, its pharmaceuticals unit has been its main growth driver in recent years.  J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott said the positive pharma outlook was tempered by ongoing growth challenges to the company\u2019s medical device and the ongoing talc litigation.  The company posted net profit of $3.04 billion, or $1.12 per share, for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $10.71 billion, or $3.99 per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a $13.6 billion charge related to changes to the U.S. tax law.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.97 per share, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.95 per share.  The company said it expected adjusted 2019 profit in the range of $8.50 per share to $8.65 per share, compared with analysts\u2019 expectation of $8.60 per share.  Shares of the company were down 1 percent at $129.35 in early trading.

The pause comes around a month after AstraZeneca Plc also suspended trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine - which uses a similar technology - due to a participant falling ill. That trial remains on pause.  U.S.-based J&J, whose vaccine effort is among the high profile attempts to fight the coronavirus pandemic, said on Monday the illness was being reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring board as well as its own clinical and safety team. The data board is then required to submit its findings to the U.S. Food and Drug administration before the study can be restarted.  Mathai Mammen, head of research & development at J&J\u2019s drugs business, said the company informed the safety board about the ill trial participant on Sunday. The board has asked for more information, he said, adding that the company is collecting information to answer its questions.  \u201cIt will be a few days at minimum for the right set of information to be gathered and evaluated,\u201d Mammen said during a conference call to discuss the company\u2019s quarterly results.  He said because the study is blinded, the company did not yet know if the ill person had been given the vaccine or a placebo.  J&J said such pauses are normal in big trials, which can include tens of thousands of people. The company said the trial is still on track to continue adding patients over the coming months.  It noted that the voluntary \u201cstudy pause\u201d in giving doses of the vaccine candidate to trial participants was different from a \u201cregulatory hold\u201d imposed by health authorities.  Former FDA chief said on Twitter the trial said that the oversight of safety boards for the COVID-19 vaccine trials is evidence of the \u201cintegrity, rigor, and careful nature\u201d of the vaccine trial process.  Experts and officials have voiced concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump could put pressure on vaccine makers to rush an unsafe or ineffective vaccine to market.  AstraZeneca last month paused late-stage trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine developed with the University of Oxford due to a serious unexplained illness in a British study participant.  While AstraZeneca\u2019s trials in Britain, Brazil, South Africa and India have since resumed, its U.S. trial is still on hold, pending a regulatory review.  The J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines both use modified, harmless versions of adenoviruses to deliver genetic instructions to human cells in order to spur an immune response to the target virus, in this case the novel coronavirus.

AstraZeneca and medical experts say trial suspensions to look into the cause of a participant\u2019s illness are not uncommon.  J&J on Sept. 22 became the fourth Warp Speed participant to enter the final stage of human vaccine testing, with the aim of enrolling 60,000 volunteers in the United States and abroad.\u201dEverybody is on the alert because of what happened with AstraZeneca,\u201d Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said by email, adding it could take a week to gather information.  \u201cThis is likely to be a neurological event,\u201d he said. Last month, J&J said its vaccine candidate produced a strong immune response in an early-to-mid stage clinical trial. This prompted the company to start the large scale trial, with results expected by the end of this year or early 2021.  Stat News reported the pause earlier, citing a document sent to outside researchers, which stated that a \u201cpausing rule\u201d had been met, the online system used to enroll patients in the study had been closed and the data and safety monitoring board would be convened.","113":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany could offer shots against the coronavirus to all who want them by the summer if a third vaccine from either Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca or CureVac wins EU approval, Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Tuesday.

If one or two additional vaccines get approval, I think we will reach that point toward summer.\u201d  Germany at the weekend rolled out the BioNTech\/Pfizer vaccine developed by the German biotech company with its U.S. partner, starting in elderly care homes where death rates are highest.  Europe\u2019s biggest economy has been in a strict lockdown that is expected to be extended beyond Jan. 10 as it struggles to contain a second wave of infections.  BioNTech\/Pfizer is the only COVID-19 vaccine approved in the EU. Moderna has said it expects the EU, which has already secured about 160 million shots from the U.S.-based company, to approve its vaccine in mid-January.  German biotech firm CureVac this month started a large Phase 2b\/3 clinical trial of its vaccine candidate.  J&J has said it has enrolled about 45,000 participants for the first late-stage trial of its single-dose vaccine candidate and that it expects interim data by late-January.  A senior EU drugs regulator has said the bloc will most likely not be able to approve the vaccine developed by drug maker AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford in January.  Spahn said if a third vaccine is approved in the EU, Germany would in theory be able to achieve herd immunity through inoculation next year.","114":"FILE PHOTO: The Johnson & Johnson logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 29, 2019.

The treatment, Spravato, which is the chemical mirror image of the often-abused anesthetic ketamine, won U.S. approval in March, making it the first new type of drug for depression in more than 30 years.  However, due to the potential for abuse, Spravato was approved with a host of restrictions that included requiring the drug to be administered only in a certified medical facility.  J&J has said that over 2,000 centers in the U.S. have been certified to administer Spravato, which has been touted as an asset with blockbuster potential.  EMA\u2019s human medicines committee (CHMP) backed the drug on Friday as a combination therapy for adults with major depressive disorder who have not benefited from prior antidepressants.  Major depressive disorder affects over 300 million people globally. About 30% to 40% of these patients fail to respond to first-line treatments such as antidepressants, most of which take at least four weeks to show an effect.  While final approvals are up to the European Commission, it generally follows the panel\u2019s recommendation and announces its decision within a couple of months.","115":"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa\u2019s health minister said on Wednesday the government may sell or swap doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine it may not need, as it scrambles to start inoculating its citizens with an alternative U.S. shot next week.  A vial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is pictured at the Foch hospital in Suresnes, near Paris, France, February 8, 2021. REUTERS\/Benoit Tessier  The unusual move comes just days after South Africa paused the rollout of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University following a small clinical trial that showed it did not protect against mild to moderate illness from the 501Y.V2 variant dominant in the country.  One million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute of India, landed in the country last week, and another 500,000 are due to arrive in coming weeks. That\u2019s enough to inoculate 750,000 people.  South Africa was also expecting to receive AstraZeneca shots via the COVAX global vaccine distribution scheme co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and an African Union (AU) arrangement.  Health Minister Zweli Mkhize told a news conference the country would start vaccinating health workers with Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine in the form of an \u201cimplementation study\u201d with researchers some time next week.  He said he would wait for advice from scientists before proceeding with the possible sale or switch of the British shot.  \u201cWhy not sell the AstraZeneca to other countries, well it\u2019s an option, ... we will consider it. First our scientists will tell us what we do with it, can we use it within the time that\u2019s available ... before it expires,\u201d Mkhize said.  \u201cIf not, can we swap it with anyone else, because we\u2019ve discussed it with COVAX and with AVATT (the AU\u2019s vaccine task team), so we will see what we will do.\u201d  It\u2019s not clear how an onward sale or swap would work given the varying prices for vaccines around the world or if the British drugmaker would have to agree to such a move. Serum and AstraZeneca declined to comment.  Still, in a briefing to lawmakers later in the day, Mkhize said the government wanted to see whether it could swap AstraZeneca shots it had ordered privately for a different vaccine available under the COVAX scheme run by the WHO and international vaccines alliance Gavi. The WHO and Gavi did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Mkhize said he would discuss a proposal to swap 500,000 doses from Serum that have not yet been delivered with COVAX, which has secured big supplies of the shot for distribution to poor nations.  The move is the latest twist in a saga that has engulfed the South African government this week as it scrambles to tame the fast-spreading variant. The country\u2019s death toll is nearing 47,000 and infections have surpassed 1.47 million.  Turning to the U.S. drugmaker for alternative supplies is also another blow to the British drugmaker, whose vaccine is considered critical for poor nations because it\u2019s cheap and easy to store.  ALTERNATIVES  The government\u2019s Ministerial Advisory Committee should be able to give a considered view on how to deal with the AstraZeneca vaccines in the next week or two, Mkhize said, adding that the government had also secured vaccine doses from Pfizer for health workers.  Negotiations with Moderna, China\u2019s Sinopharm and over Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine are ongoing.  Mkhize referred to the first batch of J&J doses as \u201cbridging stock\u201d, with the first shots expected to land next week.  \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the first batch would actually be not paid for, because it would be covered more as the research stock. So if we are able to achieve that, it\u2019s fine, but if we have got to pay for it, we have got no problem,\u201d he said.  Officials previously said the country had secured 9 million J&J single-dose shots, and Mkhize said a deal could be finalised soon.  Eventually, most of the J&J supplies could come from local pharmaceutical company Aspen, which is due to bring production on stream around April, Mkhize said.  The J&J vaccine was 89% effective at preventing severe disease and 57% effective against moderate to severe disease in the South African leg of a global trial. Ninety-five percent of infections observed in the local study were due to the 501Y.V2 variant first identified late last year.  The 501Y.V2 variant has alarmed health experts who have raised concerns about its ability to potentially evade the immune response generated by prior exposure to the coronavirus or vaccines.  South Africa\u2019s neighbour eSwatini said on Tuesday that it also would not be using the AstraZeneca vaccine.  South Africa hopes to vaccinate 40 million people, or two-thirds of its population, to achieve some level of herd immunity.","116":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian drug authorities visited some of Johnson & Johnson's JNJ.N facilities on Wednesday and took \"tests and samples\" of its talcum powder, the company said in a statement.

A source at the CDSCO said its officials lifted samples for testing from nine Indian cities - Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Indore, Chandigarh and Ghaziabad.  J&J did not immediately specify how many manufacturing plants the company has in India.  A CDSCO spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.  Surendranath Sai, a regional drug officer in the southern state of Telangana, on Wednesday said he would instruct inspectors to collect samples there.  \u201cOn the basis of the news report, we are alerting staff to pick up samples.

Certainly we are worried because millions of babies may be affected.\u201d  Earlier, the Times of India quoted an official source as saying 100 drug inspectors had been assigned to examine different manufacturing facilities, wholesalers and distributors linked to J&J India, starting early on Wednesday.  A health ministry spokeswoman declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. However, a senior official at the ministry said the report was worrying.  \u201cWe are concerned about it and will take action,\u201d the official told Reuters, declining to be identified due to the matter\u2019s sensitivity. The official did not elaborate on what kind of action the ministry could take.  A Reuters examination of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, showed that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J\u2019s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.  It also showed that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over how to address the problem while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.  The documents also depicted successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators\u2019 plans regarding limiting asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on talc\u2019s health effects.

If it is a single dose, that means 1 billion people. But it will be in a ramp-up throughout the year,\u201d Stoffels said.  Initial launch capacity depends in part on validation of manufacturing plants, he added. The company is scaling up efforts to both produce the active vaccine and the means to package and ship it in large quantities.  Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine is being produced in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India with the help of contract manufacturers in order to build capacity.  \u201cIt\u2019s a few weeks too early to be giving final numbers on what we can launch in the first couple months,\u201d he said.  Although J&J\u2019s clinical trial protocols allowed for an early look at the data after 20 people became infected by the novel coronavirus, the company intends to deliver data on at least 154 confirmed cases - the target needed to fully assess the vaccine\u2019s efficacy - when it releases results. That should come in the last week of January or the first week of February, Stoffels said.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires at least two months of safety data on half of the study participants to ensure no unexpected side effects crop up, as well as data on specific populations such as the elderly. The company crossed that two-month threshold earlier this month.  \u201cThat point came so close to the final analysis that we decided not to do an interim analysis,\u201d Stoffels said.  A surge in COVID-19 cases in the fall that exceeded J&J\u2019s initial projections allowed the company to reduce the number of study volunteers to 40,000 from the initially planned 60,000 participants. Data can be collected faster when community transmission is widespread during testing.  J&J plans to seek emergency use authorization from the FDA based on the study of the vaccine as a single shot, Stoffels said. If results of ongoing studies suggest people would fare better with a second booster shot, Stoffels said J&J would file separately for a booster dose authorization.  The company is closely monitoring changes or mutations in the virus that might affect the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness.  Scientists are particularly concerned about a highly transmissible variant of the virus first discovered in South Africa that could affect how well vaccines protect against it.  Because part of J&J\u2019s clinical trial is being conducted in South Africa, Stoffels said the company should have data on how its vaccine fares against this new variant.

The state\u2019s attorney general had filed the lawsuit, seeking $17 billion to address the impact of the drug crisis on Oklahoma. It had been considered a bellwether for other litigation nationwide over the opioid epidemic.  \u201cThe expectation was this was going to be a $1.5 billion to $2 billion fine,\u201d said Jared Holz, healthcare strategist for Jefferies & Co. \u201c$572 million is a much lower number than had been feared.\u201d  J&J said it would appeal the decision.  Shares of J&J were up 2% in extended trading following the decision, after an initial gain of more than 5%. Other drugmakers that sell opioid painkillers and are defending against similar lawsuits also rose after-hours, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.TA up 2.6%, and Endo International Plc ENDP.O, up 1.4% higher.  Opioids were involved in almost 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2000, some 6,000 Oklahomans have died from opioid overdoses, according to the state\u2019s lawyers.  Roughly 2,500 lawsuits have been brought by states, counties and municipalities nationally seeking to hold drugmakers responsible for opioid abuse nationwide. Oklahoma\u2019s case was the first to go to trial. Some drugmakers have chosen to settle cases.  In holding J&J liable after a seven-week, non-jury trial, Judge Thad Balkman of Cleveland County District Court in Norman, Oklahoma, said the state proved that J&J\u2019s misleading marketing and promotion of its Duragesic and Nucynta painkillers created a public nuisance.  \u201cThe opioid crisis is an imminent danger and menace to Oklahomans,\u201d Balkman said.  Oklahoma wanted J&J to help it address the epidemic for the next 30 years by funding addiction treatment and prevention programs.  Balkman said in his written ruling that the award covered only one year of addressing the crisis because Oklahoma did not demonstrate the time and costs needed beyond that.  Lance Lang, a 36-year-old recovering user of opioids turned activist in Oklahoma City, said it was \u201cshort sighted\u201d for the judge to have only ordered funding for a year. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be people struggling with this for years,\u201d he said in an interview.  J&J said it will ask that the award be put on hold during an appeal process that could stretch into 2021. The company also said Oklahoma failed to show that its products and activities had created a public nuisance.  \u201cYou can\u2019t sue your way out of the opioid abuse crisis,\u201d Sabrina Strong, a lawyer for J&J, said at a news conference after the verdict. \u201cEveryone must come together to address this. But J&J did not cause the opioid crisis.\u201d  \u201cACCOUNTABLE FOR DEATHS AND ADDICTIONS\u201d  The case was brought by Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, who alleged that J&J\u2019s marketing practices helped fuel the opioid epidemic by flooding the market with painkillers.  \u201cJohnson & Johnson will finally be held accountable for thousands of deaths and addictions caused by their actions,\u201d Hunter said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The trial came after Oklahoma had resolved claims against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP in March for $270 million and Teva in May for $85 million, leaving J&J as the lone defendant.  The verdict came as two Ohio counties prepare for a scheduled October trial before a federal judge in Cleveland. About 2,000 lawsuits out of some 2,500 filed nationwide are consolidated in the case in Cleveland.  Endo International Plc ENDP.O and Allergan Plc AGN.N last week agreed to pay $15 million to avoid going to trial in October in a case by two Ohio counties, subject to court approval.  Some plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have compared the opioid cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Joe Rice, a lead plaintiff\u2019s attorney for municipalities in the federal litigation, said if the Oklahoma award were extrapolated to other states, it could mean an annual abatement cost of around $38 billion.  \u201cIt does indicate that if I\u2019m in the pharmaceutical business, I\u2019ve got to think long and hard about annual payments of my share of that,\u201d he said.  The judge overseeing the federal litigation in Ohio has been pushing for a global settlement.  J&J, which is among multiple pharmaceutical companies that are defendants in the federal litigation, said it remains \u201copen to viable options\u201d to resolve the Ohio case, including through settlement.  During the Oklahoma trial, lawyers for the state argued that J&J carried out a years-long marketing campaign that minimized the painkillers\u2019 addiction risks and promoted their benefits.  The lawyers called J&J an opioid \u201ckingpin\u201d and argued that its marketing created a public nuisance as doctors over-prescribed the drugs, leading to a surge in overdose deaths.  J&J countered that its marketing claims had scientific support and its painkillers accounted for a tiny fraction of opioids prescribed in Oklahoma. The company said in a statement that since 2008, its painkillers accounted for less than 1% of the U.S. market, including generics.  Teva said the ruling supported its rationale for settling the case before trial, and said it was preparing to defend itself in the upcoming trial in Ohio.  Purdue, which is also among the defendants in the Ohio litigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","129":"FILE PHOTO: The Johnson & Johnson logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 29, 2019.

A single shot, versus a rival two-dose approach being tested by Moderna Inc MRNA.O and Pfizer Inc PFE.N, could simplify distribution of the vaccine.  However, it is unclear whether elderly people, one of the populations most at risk from the virus, will be protected to the same degree as younger people with the J&J vaccine.  The trial in close to 1,000 healthy adults, which is backed by the U.S. government, began after the J&J vaccine was found in July to offer strong protection in a single dose to monkeys.  Based on the current results, J&J on Wednesday kicked off a final 60,000-person trial, which could pave the way for an application for regulatory approval. The company said it expects results of that so-called Phase 3 trial by the end of the year or early next year.  The results, released on the medical website medRxiv, have not been peer-reviewed. (bit.ly\/2G3Ni1X)  Researchers, including those from J&J\u2019s unit Janssen Pharmaceuticals, said 98% of participants with data available for the interim analysis had neutralizing antibodies, which defend cells from pathogens, 29 days after vaccination.  However, immune response results were available from only a small number of people - 15 participants - over 65 years old, limiting the interpretation.  In participants older than 65, the rate of adverse reactions such as fatigue and muscle aches was 36%, much lower than the 64% seen in younger participants, the results showed, suggesting the immune response in older people may not be as strong.  The researchers said more details on safety and effectiveness will follow when the study is completed.  For now, the results justify why more studies are needed in larger numbers to look for serious adverse effects, Dr. Barry Bloom, a professor at Harvard T.H.

Lanier said it was uncertain at this point how many of the roughly 10,000 Pinnacle lawsuits would be subject to the settlement. He declined further comment.  A spokeswoman for DePuy on Monday declined to comment.  Bloomberg first reported on the settlement talks.  In 2013, DePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. The Pinnacle system continues to be sold with other material combinations.  Metal-on-metal hip implants have come under scrutiny over allegations that the products cause a build-up of metal ions in the blood, causing groin pain, allergic reactions, bone erosion and tissue death.  J&J denies those allegations, saying the company acted appropriately and responsibly in the development, testing and marketing of the devices.  Last month, J&J agreed to pay $120 million to resolve deceptive marketing claims by several U.S. states over metal-on-metal hip implants. DePuy said the settlement involved no admission of liability or misconduct on the part of the companies.  J&J to date has faced several federal jury trials over the Pinnacle hip implants. It won the first case in 2014, but lost all subsequent trials, with verdicts ranging from $151 million to $540 million.  J&J has appealed those verdicts.  News of the settlement talks on Monday caused a federal judge overseeing an ongoing Pinnacle trial in Dallas to dismiss the jury in that case.

Meanwhile, Moderna Inc is gearing up to begin late-stage studies later this month, while AstraZeneca Plc is expected to report results from its experimental coronavirus vaccine soon.  Sales of medical devices at J&J tumbled by a third in the second quarter as hospitals and patients delayed non-urgent procedures like hip and knee replacements, but J.P.

Some states have started to resume elective procedures, and J&J said in April that it expects a recovery in the fourth quarter of this year.

Under the deal, J&J\u2019s Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit will obtain a worldwide license for Arrowhead\u2019s ARO-HBV drug and an option to collaborate on up to three new RNA interference (RNAi)drugs, which use gene-silencing technology.  J&J will make a $75 million equity investment in Arrowhead at $23 per share, a premium of about 24 percent to the company\u2019s Wednesday close. Arrowhead will also get $175 million upfront, the company said in a statement.  Arrowhead is also eligible to receive up to $1.6 billion in milestone payments for the Hepatitis B license agreement and about $1.9 billion in option and milestone payments for the collaboration agreement related to up to three additional targets.  The deal validates J&J\u2019s interest in Arrowhead\u2019s Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiM) technology, the Pasadena, California-based company said in a statement.  Using TRiM, Arrowhead develops RNAi medicines that treat diseases by targeting and silencing specific genetic material, thereby blocking the production of disease-causing proteins.  The deal comes a month after Arrowhead released data from an early trial testing ARO-HBV. Analysts had dubbed the drug\u2019s results as \u201crevolutionary\u201d, saying that the company was positioned to develop a functional cure for Hepatitis B.  Hepatitis B, which affects an estimated 257 million people, is a life-threatening viral infection that attacks the liver. It is transmitted through contact with body fluids and patients risk death from cirrhosis and liver cancer.  Janssen will also fund Arrowhead to develop and test three new drugs in animals, following which the healthcare conglomerate will have the option to develop them further and sell them.

The anti-viral drug Kaletra, produced by AbbVie Inc, could be a possible treatment for COVID-19, Israel\u2019s Health Ministry said after issuing a preliminary permit.  While AbbVie\u2019s patent for Kaletra in Israel ends in 2024, the patent in some other countries, such as India, has expired.  It was the first time the country\u2019s attorney general has allowed the use of a generic version of a patent-protected drug in Israel, where there are 529 confirmed coronavirus cases.  \u201cThe company with the patent and the official importer in Israel are not able to supply the necessary inventory for this drug, which is very much in demand all over the world these days,\u201d the Justice Ministry said in a statement.  \u201cTherefore ... the state will be able to import generic substitutes from countries where the patent has expired.\u201d  It said generic Kaletra will only be used to treat coronavirus and not HIV, to protect the patent holder.  A study released on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the drug was not effective as a potential treatment for coronavirus.  The test of Chinese patients with severe COVID-19 found the 99 who received Kaletra, a combination of HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, fared no better than the 100 who received standard care.  Those on the drugs showed clinical improvement after a median of 15 days compared to 16 days with standard care, a difference researchers said was \u201csignificant, albeit modest\u201d.  Johnson & Johnson has been testing a similar HIV drug, known as a protease inhibitor, against the novel coronavirus.  At a panel on Thursday organized by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Paul Stoffels, J&J\u2019s chief scientific officer, said its HIV drug Prezista, does not appear to have any effect against COVID-19.  \u201cWe know from our scientific work that there is no activity on COVID-19,\u201d Stoffels told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely there is any benefit of protease inhibitors,\u201d he added.  He discouraged the use of HIV drugs to treat COVID-19 patients if they are proven to be ineffective.  \u201cPeople with HIV will be deprived of medicine if it used in a non-necessary way in this outbreak.\u201d","141":"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa launched its COVID-19 vaccination drive on Wednesday, battling to tame a more infectious variant of the coronavirus with a roll-out of the Johnson & Johnson shot for the first time outside a major clinical trial.  \u201cI actually feel blessed, you know, after all our hard work and effort in the first and second wave that we finally have another layer of protection, another tool...in the fight against COVID-19,\u201d said emergency physician Sa\u2019ad Lahri, one of the first South Africans to be vaccinated.  \u201cI am still Zoliswa, no side-effects,\u201d said nurse Zoliswa Gidi-Dyosi, who was also inoculated at Cape Town\u2019s Khayelitsha District Hospital along with President Cyril Ramaphosa and Health Minister Zweli Mkhize.  South Africa has recorded almost half of the COVID-19 deaths and over a third of confirmed infections in all of Africa, but has lagged wealthier Western nations in launching its immunisation campaign.  The government plans to vaccinate 40 million people, or two-thirds of the population in Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy. But it suffered a setback when a small local trial showed AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness from the 501Y.V2 virus variant dominant in the country.  Authorities have paused plans to use the AstraZeneca vaccine and are considering selling or swapping doses they have ordered.  Instead the J&J vaccine is being deployed as part of a research study targeting up to 500,000 healthcare workers. The U.S. company has been submitting data to South African medicines regulator SAHPRA to secure registration for a larger-scale roll-out.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Ramaphosa called the start of immunisations \u201ca new era\u201d and said he was confident the country would meet its vaccination targets. \u201cI\u2019d like to say to all the doomsayers: let\u2019s all have hope and faith in our system, our healthworkers, and let\u2019s give them an opportunity to do what they do best.\u201d  South Africa is one of the first African nations, along with Rwanda, Morocco and Egypt, to vaccinate against COVID-19.  Zimbabwe will start inoculations on Thursday, while Senegal is expecting its first vaccine delivery on Wednesday.  ASTRAZENECA REVELATION  Ramaphosa\u2019s government has been under pressure to get the first shots in arms quickly after the revelation that AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine had greatly reduced efficacy against the 501Y.V2 variant first identified late last year.  Officials already faced deep scepticism among some South Africans about COVID-19 vaccines.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Health Minister Mkhize said it was an emotional moment when the plane carrying the first 80,000 J&J doses touched down late on Tuesday, praising doctors and nurses as \u201cfrontline warriors\u201d.  He said the government had a long discussion with AstraZeneca\u2019s leadership about possibly conducting another local study to reduce the levels of uncertainty about the British firm\u2019s vaccine.  AstraZeneca declined comment when asked about that discussion. It said previously that it believes its vaccine protects against severe COVID-19 and that it has started adapting it against the 501Y.V2 variant.  The next vaccine to arrive in South Africa will be from Pfizer, which will supply around 500,000 doses initially and about 7 million doses by June, Mkhize said.","142":"CHICAGO\/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc's AZN.L COVID-19 vaccine trial in the United States is expected to resume as early as this week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration completed its review of a serious illness in a study participant, four sources told Reuters.  A test tube labelled vaccine is seen in front of AstraZeneca logo in this illustration taken, September 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  AstraZeneca\u2019s large, late-stage U.S. trial has been on hold since Sept. 6, after a participant in the company\u2019s UK trial fell ill with what was suspected to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.  The sources, who were briefed on the matter but asked to remain anonymous, said they have been told the trial could resume later this week. It was unclear how the FDA would characterize the illness, they said.  An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment.  The agency is requiring researchers conducting the trial to add information about the incident to consent forms signed by study participants, according to one of the sources.  UK regulatory officials previously reviewed the illness and determined there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to say for certain\u201d that it was or was not related to the vaccine. It permitted the trial to resume in the UK, according to a draft of the updated consent form shared with Reuters.  \u201cIn this case, after considering the information, the independent reviewers and MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) recommended that vaccinations should continue,\u201d the draft consent form stated. \u201cClose monitoring of the affected individual and other participants will be continued.\u201d  Regulators in Brazil, India and South Africa also previously allowed AstraZeneca to resume its vaccine trials there.  AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with Oxford University researchers, had been seen as a frontrunner in the race to produce a vaccine for COVID-19 until its trials were put on hold to investigate the illness. Early data from large-scale trials in the United States of vaccines from Pfizer Inc PFE.N and Moderna Inc MRNA.O are expected some time next month.  Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N last week paused its Phase III COVID-19 vaccine trial to investigate an unexplained illness in a study participant. At the time of the announcement, the company did not know whether the volunteer had been given its vaccine or a placebo.  A J&J spokesman on Tuesday said the study remains on pause as the company continues its review of medical information before deciding to restart the trial. J&J noted last week that its \u201cstudy pause\u201d was voluntary. By contrast, AstraZeneca\u2019s trial is on \u201cregulatory hold,\u201d which is imposed by health authorities.  Vaccines are seen as essential to helping end the pandemic that has battered economies around the world and claimed more than 1 million lives - over 220,000 of them in the United States.  Responding to a request about the AstraZeneca trial, British regulators shared with Reuters a draft of a form letter to UK vaccine trial participants, dated Oct. 14 and signed by the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Team. It says the U.S. FDA had \u201ccompleted their analysis\u201d and said vaccination under the study in the United States would resume shortly.  FDA \u201chas come to the same conclusion as the other drug regulators including the MHRA,\u201d the letter states.  The Health Research Authority, which helps oversee UK medical research, said in an email to Reuters that it vetted the communication to make sure it was suitable to ensure informed consent among study volunteers. It could not confirm that the letter had been issued.  An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said the communication is not from the company and it \u201ccannot verify the content,\u201d referring to the draft letter to study participants.  \u201cWe also cannot comment on a pending FDA decision,\u201d she said. The Oxford study team did not respond to requests for comment.  NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE  In another of the documents directed at trial participants, the Oxford vaccine study team noted that there was not enough evidence to link the neurological problem seen in the UK trial to the vaccine.  Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, who reviewed the document, said it can be difficult to link a rare side effect specifically to a vaccine to the exclusion of other potential causes.  Transverse myelitis, which the study volunteer is believed to have developed, typically occurs at a rate of 1-in-200,000 people, Offit said, so it would be unusual to see it in a trial of 9,000 individuals.  Other viruses including those that cause West Nile and polio can trigger the condition, as can physical trauma.  The regulators have to weigh whether a rare side effect is vaccine-related and could occur again against the sickness and deaths linked with COVID-19, Offit said. \u201cThat\u2019s always the line that you walk.\u201d","143":"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa, which has yet to receive its first coronavirus vaccine doses, will be getting 9 million from Johnson & Johnson, the health ministry said on Monday.

Health ministry spokeswoman Lwazi Manzi did not specify when the J&J doses might be available. She was confirming a report in the Business Day newspaper.  The J&J doses take the total number of doses that South Africa stands to receive to more than 30 million.  J&J did not respond to an email seeking comment. The U.S. healthcare company\u2019s chief scientific officer said last week it was on track to roll out its single-shot coronavirus vaccine in March, and expects to have clear data on how effective it is by the end of this month or early February.  South Africa should also receive about 12 million doses from the COVAX global vaccine distribution scheme co-led by the World Health Organization, about 12 million from an African Union (AU) arrangement, and 1.5 million from the Serum Institute of India which is making AstraZeneca shots.  The calculation for the AU allocation is based on South Africa\u2019s share of the continent\u2019s population.  South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, the AU chair, said last week that the organisation had secured 270 million vaccine doses and that they would be distributed based on countries\u2019 population size.  South Africa\u2019s health ministry said this month it was in advanced negotiations with J&J.

The deal announced on Thursday by the European Commission is its third advance purchase contract with makers of COVID-19 vaccines after deals with AstraZeneca and Sanofi , bringing the number of doses secured by the EU for its population of 450 million to 1.1 billion.  Under the terms of the deal, the 27 EU states will be able to order up to 400 million doses of the potential vaccine after it is authorised by the EU medicine regulator.  To secure the vaccines, the EU made an undisclosed downpayment to J&J, which confirmed the deal in a statement in which it reiterated plans to allocate up to 500 million additional doses to poorer countries from mid-2021.  EU states would pay the full price only when they order it. The price and liability conditions are confidential.  The J&J deal follows supply contracts for 400 million doses of the potential vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and for 300 million doses of the shot being trailed by a partnership between Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline.  The Commission has also said publicly that it was in advanced talks to secure vaccines being developed by Moderna , CureVac and a partnership between Pfizer and BioNTech, which if they are confirmed would give the EU a total supply of nearly 2 billion doses.  The EU is in talks with Novavax for a seventh vaccine, a senior EU source told Reuters last month .  If it strikes seven deals, the EU would be ahead of Britain and the United States, which each have concluded six supply contracts so far.  The J&J vaccine, which is being developed by its subsidiary Janssen, is based on vector technology, the same used by AstraZeneca. Sanofi\u2019s is a protein-based jab.

FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The panel voted 14-2 in favor of the drug esketamine, developed to treat major depression in patients who have not benefited from at least two different therapies, saying its benefits outweighed the risks. One panel member abstained from voting.  Esketamine is a chemical mirror image of anesthetic ketamine, which is also abused as a recreational party drug and goes by the street nickname \u201cSpecial K\u201d.  \u201cI think esketamine has the potential to be a game-changer in the treatment of depression ... I use the term potential because the issues of cost and patient accessibility need to be addressed,\u201d said Walter Dunn, who voted in favor of approval.  However, the panel members echoed concerns raised by FDA staffers on Friday regarding the increased risk of sedation, dissociation and higher blood pressure observed in the study.  The FDA recommended implementing a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program which included ensuring esketamine is only dispensed and administered under supervision.  \u201cKetamine is a nasty drug ... should (J&J\u2019s) drug get approved, I think a strong effort has to be given as part of REMS ... so that patients really know what they are getting themselves into,\u201d said Steven Meisel, another member who voted \u2018yes\u2019.  Major depressive disorder affects over 300 million people globally. About 30 percent to 40 percent of these patients fail to respond to first-line treatments such as antidepressants, most of which take at least four weeks to show effect.  However, depression is a tricky area of development. Patients in clinical trials often show a big placebo response, masking the efficacy of the drug being tested.  Currently, Eli Lilly and Co\u2019s Symbyax is the only FDA-approved drug for treatment-resistant depression.  \u201cThere is a lot of potential for people that just want that quick fix. I really would be cautious,\u201d said Kim Witczak, a panel member who voted \u2018no\u2019.  J&J\u2019s esketamine, used in combination with a newly prescribed antidepressant, works by restoring the nerve cell connections in the brain, leading to an improvement in depression symptoms.  The FDA, although not mandated to follow the panel\u2019s recommendation, is expected to announce its decision on esketamine by March 4.","147":"FILE PHOTO: A vial and syringe are seen in front of a displayed Johnson&Johnson logo in this illustration taken January 11, 2021.

J&J said in a statement it intends to immediately begin distributing doses upon U.S. authorization and expects to supply 100 million doses to the United States in the first half of 2021.  The United States has been struggling to hasten its vaccine rollout because of a limited supply of doses. Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc have promised to deliver 200 million doses of their two-dose vaccines by the end of March but so far fewer than 72 million doses have been shipped around the U.S. and around 55 million shots have been given.  The U.S. paid J&J $1 billion in August to help fund the development of its vaccine in exchange for a guarantee of 100 million doses and an option to buy 200 million more. It also provided J&J with $456 million in March.  The Biden administration has promised to explore every option available to aid drugmakers, including J&J, in boosting vaccine production. It said it is deploying wartime powers through the Defense Production Act to help them secure needed supplies.  J&J\u2019s experimental shot involves a single dose and can be stored in refrigerators as opposed to freezers, which could help speed up vaccinations.  Zients said the vaccine could be authorized in a couple of weeks. It is scheduled to be reviewed on Feb. 26 by a panel of outside advisors to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  The jury delivered its unanimous verdict in Middlesex County Superior Court in New Brunswick, just miles from J&J\u2019s headquarters, in the case of plaintiff Ricardo Rimondi.  J&J, which faces some 13,000 talc-related lawsuits nationwide, denies that its talc causes cancer, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free.  Johnson & Johnson on Wednesday also settled three other mesothelioma talc cases pending in state courts in California, Oklahoma and New York, Chris Panatier, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told Reuters.  Panatier declined to provide further details, citing confidentiality agreements.  Addressing the settlements, J&J in a statement said, \u201cthere are one-off situations where settlement is reasonable.\u201d  J&J said it stood by the safety of its talc and would continue to vigorously defend the safety of baby powder.  \u201cWe do not have any organized program to settle Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder cases, nor are we planning a settlement program,\u201d the company said.  Referring to the Rimondi verdict, J&J said the company\u2019s track record in the talc litigation underscored \u201cthe decades of clinical evidence and scientific studies by medical experts around the world\u201d supporting the safety of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder.  J&J shares, which had been down slightly, turned positive after the jury verdict was announced and closed up 13 cents at $138.70.  Lawyers for the 58-year old Rimondi could not be reached for comment.  Rimondi in 2016 was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a type of cancer that has been linked to asbestos exposure.  He and his wife sued J&J in 2017. They alleged that Rimondi\u2019s lifetime exposure to Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, another powder product containing talc sold by J&J in the past, caused his disease.  The jury returned its verdict in favor of the company after just half an hour of deliberations, according to a livestream of the proceedings by Courtroom View Network.  The healthcare conglomerate to date has faced 12 trials by plaintiffs claiming asbestos in talc caused their mesothelioma.  J&J has now been cleared of liability in four trials, with another five resulting in hung juries and mistrials. Three juries have found J&J liable, awarding a total of $172 million in damages. J&J is appealing those verdicts.  The majority of the 13,000 talc lawsuits against the company involve ovarian cancer claims. Juries in those cases have hit the company with verdicts as high as $4.69 billion.  Some of the ovarian cancer verdicts have been overturned on appeal on technical legal grounds, while the company\u2019s other appeals are still pending.  \u201cIt remains true that of all the talc-related verdicts against Johnson & Johnson that have been through the appeals process, every one has been overturned,\u201d the company said in its statement on Wednesday.  Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have more recently focused on arguing that asbestos contamination in talc caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.  Reuters in December published a report detailing that the company knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results the company did not disclose to regulators or consumers.  J&J denies the findings of the Reuters report, which it describes as inaccurate and misleading.

The 2016 verdict came down in the case of South Dakota resident Gloria Ristesund, who was awarded $5 million in compensatory and $50 million in punitive damages.  Ristesund alleged that her decades-long use of J&J talc-based products caused her cancer and that the company had failed to warn consumers about the risks.  J&J denies the allegations, saying decades of testing have shown its cosmetic talc-based products to be safe.  But the unanimous three-judge panel of the Missouri Court of Appeals in the Eastern District in their Friday decision did not rule on the merits of the allegations.  The judges instead said the verdict could not stand following a 2017 U.S. Supreme Court decision which limits where companies can be sued for personal injuries.  The high court in June last year ruled that state courts cannot hear claims against companies that are not based in the state when the alleged injuries did not occur there.  J&J is based in New Jersey and Ristesund exclusively purchased and used the company\u2019s talc products in South Dakota and Minnesota, according to court records.  Ristesund during the appeals process asked the court for permission to present additional evidence tying J&J to Missouri, but the judges on Friday rejected her request saying she had had ample opportunity to present such evidence over the past years.  J&J is battling some 9,000 cases claiming its talc-based products cause ovarian cancer and, in some cases, mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure.

FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: A bottle of Johnson and Johnson Baby Powder is seen in a photo illustration taken in New York, February 24, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/Illustration\/File Photo\/File Photo  On Tuesday, for example, J&J announced that other labs it hired ultimately found no asbestos in samples from the bottle tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or from the same production lot.  In challenging the FDA\u2019s finding, however, the healthcare giant is casting doubt on one of its own experts.  The private Maryland lab that found asbestos in Baby Powder under a contract with the FDA is run by a paid expert witness for J&J.  Andreas Saldivar, laboratory director of AMA Analytical Services Inc, has served as a litigation expert on several occasions for J&J since 2017 in its defense against plaintiffs\u2019 claims that asbestos in talc caused their cancers.  He testified in a May 2018 deposition that testing he did in 2010 for the FDA showed no evidence of asbestos in Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder, helping to bolster the company\u2019s argument that its iconic brand is safe.  Saldivar\u2019s lab began testing cosmetic talc products for the FDA again this year, and in September it found asbestos in an unmarked sample that the FDA later identified as Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder.  \u201cI have never heard of anything like this,\u201d said Richard Ausness, a University of Kentucky law professor who specializes in product liability, referring to Saldivar\u2019s dual roles. \u201cThis is bad news for J&J. The plaintiffs are clearly going to say this lab director worked for J&J for years, and he found asbestos so there must be asbestos there.\u201d  J&J\u2019s challenge now is to discredit the single test result as erroneous without undermining the reputation and track record of its expert witness, Ausness said.  \u201cJ&J could try to frame it as not so much this lab director is unreliable or incompetent, but false positives do happen and additional tests are called for,\u201d Ausness said.  The company appeared to do just that on Tuesday, saying testing done by other laboratories J&J hired had found no asbestos in the same bottle of Baby Powder tested by Saldivar for the FDA, nor in the lot of Baby Powder recalled as a result of Saldivar\u2019s finding.  In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, FDA officials said they stood by the AMA lab and its results. They also said they were not surprised by J&J\u2019s findings because contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and different testing methods can yield varying results.  The company \u201cwould say the product is free of asbestos based on their testing, and we would say the opposite for that sample,\u201d said Steve Musser, deputy director for scientific operations in FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.  Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys said Saldivar\u2019s finding for the FDA could be detrimental to J&J\u2019s defense in court. The company faces lawsuits from more than 16,000 people alleging that asbestos in its powders caused cancer.  The impact was immediate in one courtroom.  Hours after J&J disclosed the FDA\u2019s asbestos finding on Oct. 18, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, Nate Finch, asked an Indianapolis judge to let him tell the jury about it in a trial involving a 71-year-old woman who alleged that Baby Powder contributed to her cancer.  J&J\u2019s lawyers opposed the request, arguing that the information could prejudice the jury against the company, but the judge granted Finch\u2019s request. Days later, Finch told the judge his client had come to a confidential resolution with J&J, a trial transcript shows. Finch told Reuters he could not comment on the resolution.  J&J did not respond to questions about the Indianapolis case. The company declined to comment on Saldivar\u2019s role in the FDA testing, or on how it might affect the company\u2019s legal strategy going forward.  Saldivar declined to comment.  NO SAFE LEVELS  In a June deposition, Saldivar said J&J lawyers had retained him in 2017 as a company expert in \u201cmaybe 20 or 30\u201d cases. His firm bills $200 to $350 an hour for his services, he testified.  Under the FDA contract, his lab found asbestos fibers in the Baby Powder sample on Sept. 7, according to the lab\u2019s report. J&J said it was notified of the finding by FDA officials on Oct. 16, prompting the company to recall 33,000 bottles \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d  In response, some major U.S. retailers have said they are removing all 22-ounce bottles of Johnson\u2019s baby powder from their shelves.  At the same time, the company has expressed suspicions about the finding, saying it had launched its own investigation \u201cto determine the integrity of the tested sample, and the validity of the test results.\u201d  On Friday, the FDA posted online Saldivar\u2019s 16-page report to the agency on the analysis of J&J Baby Powder. In samples weighing less than a gram, the lab said it found six chrysotile asbestos fibers. Given that the samples were extremely small, the asbestos could amount to millions of fibers per gram, testing experts told Reuters.  While most people exposed to asbestos never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts are enough to trigger the disease years later. Just how small hasn\u2019t been established. The World Health Organization and other health authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos, a known carcinogen.  \u201cSince there are no known safe levels of asbestos, the FDA has asked manufacturers to voluntarily recall their products when fibers consistent with asbestos are found in them,\u201d the agency said this month.  Several juries over the past two years have concluded that Baby Powder exposures caused cancer and have awarded plaintiffs more than $5 billion. Other juries have sided with J&J, and some cases have settled.  \u2018JUST NOT CORRECT\u2019  The FDA has never before announced that government testing found asbestos in J&J\u2019s Baby Powder. Since the early 1970s, J&J has pushed back hard on reports of asbestos in its talc by outside scientists, plaintiffs\u2019 experts and, on several occasions, by its own testing labs.  In an Oct. 3 deposition in a New York lawsuit, J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky dismissed the findings of asbestos over the years, saying \u201cthey were later shown to be inaccurate, incomplete and just not correct.\u201d  Attacking Saldivar\u2019s finding, some legal experts told Reuters, could hurt the company\u2019s ability to use him as a witness in lawsuits and undercut its broader message to jurors and consumers. That message boils down to: Trust our experts.  But a product liability defense lawyer who helped organize a recent talc litigation symposium said the impact on pending cases could be limited because asbestos-related cancers are known to take decades to develop. The FDA\u2019s new finding \u201cwould be difficult to tie\u201d to cancers allegedly caused by long-ago exposures, said Edward Ulloa, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who does not represent J&J.  The FDA findings are \u201cessentially anecdotal,\u201d Ulloa said, \u201cspecific to that product and that particular sample.\u201d  In its Tuesday announcement, J&J said that one of the labs it hired initially found asbestos in three samples of Baby Powder, but the lab determined that a portable air conditioner running when the samples were prepared was contaminated with asbestos. Subsequent tests in a different room found no asbestos, the company said.  NO EXPERIENCE, NO ASBESTOS  In 2010, when the AMA lab tested 34 talc products for the FDA, including Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder, the lab had no experience looking for asbestos fibers in talc milled for powders and cosmetics.  Saldivar testified in several depositions that the lab\u2019s work had previously focused on determining the amount of asbestos in old building products, such as vinyl flooring.  AMA made fast work of the 2010 FDA job, lab records reviewed by Reuters show. His lab examined 102 samples, three from each product, in a single day, using a method called transmission electron microscopy (TEM). That works out to less than five minutes per sample, assuming an eight-hour shift with no breaks.  Experts who have found asbestos in milled talc powders told Reuters they require anywhere from a half hour to a day per sample using TEM, and litigation records show they often look at more talc per sample than Saldivar has testified is the practice at AMA.  In a deposition earlier this year, Saldivar acknowledged that he looked at less talc per sample than others in the field and that looking at more talc \u201cwould raise your analytical sensitivity\u201d - the ability to find any contamination. But he said he believed that his methods were sufficient.  After the AMA lab found no asbestos in 2010, the FDA cautioned against reading too much into the results - not because of the sensitivity of the test but because so few products were tested.  Though the agency has described the testing as using the \u201cmost sensitive techniques available,\u201d it said the results \u201cdo not prove that most or all talc or talc-containing cosmetic products currently marketed in the United States are likely to be free of asbestos contamination.\u201d  When J&J\u2019s lawyers approached Saldivar a few years ago about serving as an expert and testing Baby Powder, they \u201cwanted me to follow my protocols that I used on my FDA testing\u201d in 2010, Saldivar testified in May 2018. In June, he testified that his lab had never found any asbestos in talc samples, including Baby Powder, that it had tested for J&J and other manufacturer defendants.  The testing by Saldivar\u2019s lab for the FDA this year was a different story.  \u201cThis positive test turns up the heat on J&J,\u201d said Nora Freeman Engstrom, a Stanford University law professor who studies complex litigation. \u201cAnd their expert lit the match.\u201d","166":"The company logo for Johnson & Johnson is displayed on a screen to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the company's listing at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 17, 2019.

Security guards stand outside the office of Johnson & Johnson in Mumbai, India, August 29, 2018. REUTERS\/Danish Siddiqui  This follows last week\u2019s recommendation from a government panel that J&J pay at least 2 million rupees ($27,812) to each patient for the faulty ASR hip implant. The federal government has asked states to help patients get relief soon.  About 93,000 people worldwide received ASR implants which were recalled in 2010. The Indian panel said in its report that about 4,700 of those people were in India.  Given the recent committee report, \u201cwe are seeking to work with the Indian government to develop an appropriate process for providing further support and compensation for patients in need\u201d, a J&J spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters, adding the firm was committed to support all ASR patients in India.  Sushobhan Dasgupta, a senior J&J executive in India, has, however, told Indian newspaper Mint that the company \u201cwill not pay people who had an ASR implant if they are doing well\u201d.  The company is not okay with the methodology used by the Indian panel, Dasgupta told the paper in an interview here published on Friday. The report has \"factual inaccuracies\" and \"the conclusions could also be inaccurate\", he added.  In 2013, J&J agreed to pay reut.rs\/I20AZB nearly $2.5 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits from patients in the United States who said they were injured by the implants.  In India, the company paid $2 million to patients for repeat surgeries and about $250,000 in related diagnostic costs under its ASR reimbursement program, but the government panel has criticized J&J for offering no compensation.  Metal hip implant systems such as ASR were designed to be more durable than a traditional metal-on-plastic, ball-and-socket design. But many Indian patients suffered adverse reactions to the implant, the panel said.  J&J entered the Indian market in 1947 when it started selling its now-ubiquitous baby powder. It has in recent years faced issues such as price caps on medical devices.

Vials with a sticker reading, \"COVID-19 \/ Coronavirus vaccine \/ Injection only\" and a medical syringe are seen in front of a displayed Johnson & Johnson logo in this illustration taken October 31, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  In the trial of nearly 44,000 volunteers, the level of protection against moderate and severe COVID-19 varied from 72% in the United States, to 66% in Latin America and just 57% in South Africa, from where a worrying variant has spread.  The data showed that the vaccine\u2019s effect on the South Africa variant was diminished compared to the unaltered virus, but infectious disease and public health experts said it can still help contain the virus spread and prevent deaths.  Midstage trial data from Novavax on Thursday also documented lower effectiveness in South Africa.  Rival shots from Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna were both around 95% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in pivotal trials when given in two doses.  Those trials were conducted mainly in the United States and before the emergence of new variants. These mean that the world is racing against time and with limited supplies to vaccinate as many people as possible, and quickly, to prevent virus surges.  COVID-19 is rising in 37 countries and infections have surpassed 101 million globally.  Top U.S. infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci said the world needs to vaccinate quickly to try to get ahead of these changes in the virus.  \u201cIt\u2019s really a wake up call for us to be nimble and to be able to adjust as this virus will continue for certain to evolve,\u201d Fauci said.  J&J\u2019s main goal was the prevention of moderate to severe COVID-19, and the vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization across all geographies and against multiple variants 28 days after immunization.  That \u201cwill potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of COVID-19,\u201d Paul Stoffels, J&J\u2019s chief scientific officer, said.  J&J shares were down 4% at $162.7 at 1700 GMT, with some Wall Street analysts saying its vaccine\u2019s effectiveness was below those of rivals. Moderna\u2019s stock gained 8% to $172.80.  SEEKING APPROVAL  J&J plans to seek emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration next week and will soon follow up with the European Union and the rest of the world.  It has said it plans to deliver 1 billion doses of the vaccine, which it will make in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India, in 2021.  Public health officials are counting on it to increase much-needed supply and simplify immunization in the United States, which has a deal to buy 100 million doses of J&J\u2019s vaccine and an option for an additional 200 million.  J&J said the vaccine would be ready immediately upon emergency approval, but Stoffels declined to say how many doses.  \u201cThe key is not only overall efficacy but specifically efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization, and death,\u201d said Walid Gellad, a health policy associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh.  J&J\u2019s vaccine uses a common cold virus to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells and trigger an immune response, whereas the Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines employ a new technology called messenger RNA.  Unlike these vaccines, J&J\u2019s does not require a second shot weeks after the first or need to be kept frozen, making it a strong candidate for use in parts of the world where transportation and cold storage present problems.  \u201cMost countries are still desperate to get their hands on doses, regardless of whether or not the vaccine is considered highly effective. Moderately effective will do just fine for now,\u201d Michael Breen, Director of Infectious Diseases and Ophthalmology at research firm GlobalData, said.  \u2018OVERWHELMED\u2019  Several studies have emerged this month showing that a South African variant has mutated in areas of the virus that are key targets of vaccines, reducing their efficacy.  \u201cWhat we are learning is there is different efficacy in different parts of the world,\u201d Stoffels told Reuters.  In a sub-study of 6,000 volunteers in South Africa, Stoffels said, the J&J vaccine was 89% effective at preventing severe disease. In the South Africa portion of the trial, 95% of cases were infections with the South African variant.  \u201cI am overwhelmed by the fact that this vaccine protected against severe disease even in South Africa,\u201d said Glenda Gray, the joint lead investigator of the South African vaccine trial.  In the J&J trial, which was conducted in eight countries, 44% of participants were from the United States, 41% from Central and South America and 15% from South Africa.

Major equity averages were lower, partly due to a decline in J&J shares after the company paused due to an unexplained illness in a participant, dampening optimism a vaccine was on the horizon. U.S. consumer prices rose 0.2% in September, matching expectations, for a fourth straight monthly climb, though the pace has slowed amid considerable slack in the economy as it gradually recovers from the COVID-19 recession. The dollar index rose 0.416% against a basket of other currencies, putting it on track for its biggest daily percentage gain in three weeks. The U.S. currency's safe-haven appeal has been curbed by growing expectations former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's win in the Nov. 3 presidential election would bring large stimulus for the pandemic-hit economy, bolstering the stock market and investor risk appetite.

The implementation study, similar to the final phase of a vaccine trial, will test the effects of the vaccine in the field after it is administered to around 350,000 to 500,000 health care workers.  The first batch of J&J\u2019s 80,000 doses are expected to arrive this week, President Cyril Ramaphosa told lawmakers on Thursday.  J&J was the first pharmaceutical major to apply to the local regulator in December to register its COVID-19 vaccine, although Pfizer and AstraZeneca have also applied.  South Africa is currently the hardest hit African country and accounts for over a third of the continent\u2019s infections and almost half of the deaths, led primarily by the new, more contagious variant called 501Y.V2.  The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) said J&J has not yet submitted a special domestic application for emergency use authorisation of its vaccine - known as a Section 21 application.  Normally valid for six months, Section 21 authorisation allows emergency use of a product that is unregistered, SAHPRA officials said.

Demand for the drug rose two to four times normal levels in the last three weeks, hitting its highest point over the past week, Kathleen Widmer, group chairman for North America of Johnson & Johnson Consumer Health, said in an interview.  \u201cJust when we thought we had seen the highest demand we had ever seen for Tylenol, this week the demand has grown even more,\u201d she said.  Demand for drugs containing Tylenol\u2019s main ingredient, known as paracetamol or acetaminophen, has soared in particular after France\u2019s health minister suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen could worsen COVID-19. However, the World Health Organization said there is not currently data to back this up, and has not recommended people stop using NSAIDs.  Before this latest surge, demand was already high as consumers stocked up on the drug ahead of potential quarantines.  J&J is not experiencing any shortages of its raw materials for Tylenol, and has taken steps including adding crews and increasing the use of equipment and capacity in plants in Puerto Rico and Pennsylvania where the drug is produced. The Puerto Rico plant is running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Widmer said.  \u201cWe\u2019re running it at all-out, maximum capacity,\u201d she said.  Fears around shortages of some drugs emerged after the coronavirus outbreak wreaked havoc on supply chains and were amplified earlier this month when India, the world\u2019s main supplier of generic drugs, restricted the export of some ingredients as well as medicines including paracetamol.  Widmer said that where it can, the company is narrowing its Tylenol production down to the products it can deliver the fastest.  Those products are the traditional extra strength white caplet and 4 oz bottles of children Tylenol, which will represent most of the Tylenol currently being produced.  The company has also turned off systems that manage orders from customers automatically, to avoid sending too much inventory to a single retail customer.  \u201cWe totally understand that people want to be reassured that they have what they need at home should they or someone they love become ill,\u201d Widmer said.","186":"FILE PHOTO: A vial and syringe are seen in front of a displayed Johnson&Johnson logo in this illustration taken January 11, 2021.

The jury in a Philadelphia court awarded the $8 billion to a man who previously won $680,000 over his claims that it failed to warn that young men using Risperdal could grow breasts.  J&J called the sum \u201cgrossly disproportionate with the initial compensatory award\u201d and said it was confident it would be overturned.  Legal experts agreed that the penalty was likely to be slashed.  But the verdict, which helped drive J&J\u2019s shares down 2% on Wednesday, is an example of how public outrage at the pharmaceutical industry for high drug prices has contributed to harsher verdicts against drugmakers accused of wrongdoing in recent years, legal experts said.  Outsized penalties awarded by some juries highlight risks in a longstanding strategy by drugmakers such as J&J of taking their chances at trial rather then settle product liability lawsuits brought by patients.  \u201cEvery pharmaceutical company needs to seriously consider if they want to litigate to verdict in the present environment, but with the settlement demands so incredibly high it\u2019s not always clear what their alternative is,\u201d said Barry Thompson, a partner at Baker McKenzie law firm who was not involved in the case.  Drugmakers often prefer to litigate rather than settle in hopes of protecting their brands and discouraging future patient lawsuits, Thompson said.  Companies also may use a series of early trial verdicts to gauge the size of any settlement it might eventually offer, as Merck & Co MRK.N did with its withdrawn Vioxx arthritis pain drug when facing thousands of lawsuits by patients who claimed harm from the drug.

J&J could still get a favorable ruling on appeal that would give the company leverage in dealing with the remaining cases, said Benjamin McMichael, a professor at the Alabama School of Law who has researched punitive damage awards.  \u201cWith such a large punitive damages award at issue, appellate courts may be more willing to come down hard on the plaintiffs,\u201d McMichael said.  J&J faces more than 13,000 lawsuits tied to Risperdal alleging that it caused a condition called gynecomastia in boys, in which breast tissue becomes enlarged. The company is also facing lawsuits involving its baby powder, opioids, medical devices and other products.  \u201cWe\u2019re operating within a very litigious environment, and we must at times be willing to go to trial when the science, facts and law are on our side,\u201d J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said in an email.  \u201cWe also have to remain open to resolving cases through settlement when and where that\u2019s appropriate to do. We have a proven track record of being able to successfully and appropriately manage this balance,\u201d Knewitz added.  The company has had its share of legal wins, losses and settlements.  An Oklahoma judge in August ordered J&J to pay $572.1 million to that state for its part in fueling the opioid crisis by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers, although the sum was substantially less than investors had expected.  Johnson & Johnson has said it plans to appeal the ruling.  Earlier this month, the company agreed to pay $20.4 million to settle claims by two Ohio counties, avoiding a federal opioid trial.  In 2013, J&J paid more than $2.2 billion to resolve civil and criminal investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice into its marketing of Risperdal and other drugs.","190":"(Repeats with no change to headline or text)  May 14 (Reuters) - A trial for a lawsuit alleging that Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder was responsible for the death of a woman due to her exposure to cancer-causing asbestos began in South Carolina on Monday in the latest case against the healthcare conglomerate and a supplier over their talc-based products.  J&J said that its widely-used baby powder never contained asbestos, a known carcinogen linked to mesothelioma.  The case also names as a defendant a local unit of Rite Aid , one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, which allegedly sold the baby powder used by the woman.  The case marked the first time a drugstore was involved in a talcum powder liability trial and a lawyer for the company, Sarah Johnston, said there was no reason for Rite Aid to be part of the suit.  In opening statements, a lawyer for the family of Bertila Boyd-Bostic, who died of a rare form of cancer in 2017 at the age of 30, told a jury in the Darlington County Court of Common Pleas that J&J had known for decades that its baby powder contained asbestos.  J&J and its supplier, a unit of Imerys SA, deny the allegations, and their lawyers said their talc product did not cause any form of cancer, according to an online broadcast of the trial by Courtroom View Network.  The case is one of several in recent months that alleged asbestos in talc products caused mesothelioma..  A New Jersey state court jury in April ordered J&J and Imerys to pay $117 million to a man who alleged he developed mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure from J&J Baby Powder. An appeal is pending.  J&J has also been battling some 6,000 cases claiming its baby powder caused ovarian cancer.  Boyd-Bostic used baby powder nearly all her life, her family\u2019s lawyer, Christopher Swett, said on Monday. In 2016, she was diagnosed with pericardial mesothelioma, an extremely rare form of cancer that develops in the lining around the heart.  \u201cJ&J\u2019s choices are why we\u2019re here,\u201d Swett said. He accused the company of concealing knowledge of asbestos contamination since the 1970s and choosing not to warn consumers of the risks.  Bruce Bishop, a lawyer for J&J, said there was no evidence in Boyd-Bostic\u2019s medical records that her mesothelioma was in any way related to asbestos exposure.  Michael Brown, another J&J lawyer, said millions of people had used Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder without developing any diseases. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because it does not contain asbestos,\u201d he said.

But several said that J&J\u2019s shares were now exposed to fears among investors that it would be hammered by further litigation costs as it battles other claims over Risperdal, its opioid treatments and talcum powder.  \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a disproportionate award,\u201d Bernstein analyst Lee Hambright said, noting that the FDA-approved label for the drug does mention breast growth as a side effect.  \u201c(But) I think the stock reaction shows how sensitive investors are about litigation-related concerns for Johnson & Johnson.\u201d  Wells Fargo analyst Lawrence Biegelsen said the $8 billion figure will \u201calmost certainly be reduced\u201d.  \u201cThe Supreme Court has said it should be a single digit ratio between compensatory and punitive damages,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe important number here is the compensatory damages.\u201d  J&J said the award was \u201cgrossly disproportionate with the initial compensatory award\u201d and said it was confident it would be overturned.

In 2013, Johnson & Johnson paid more than $2.2 billion to resolve civil and criminal investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice into its marketing of Risperdal and other drugs.  According to a recent filing, the company faces some 13,400 lawsuits tied to Risperdal, which allege the drug caused a condition called gynecomastia in boys, in which breast tissue becomes enlarged.  Risperdal was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002 to treat schizophrenia, but was not cleared for use in children until 2006.  While the drug\u2019s label does note that gynecomastia was reported in 2.3% of Risperdal-treated patients in clinical trials involving 1885 children and adolescents, the lawsuits generally claim the company understated the risk.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The tests are the latest effort by J&J to prove the safety of its widely used consumer product after a test by the FDA prompted J&J to undertake a nationwide recall of one lot of its Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder.  FDA officials, in an interview with Reuters, said the agency continues to support the company\u2019s voluntary recall.  \u201cThey would say the product is free of asbestos based on their testing, and we would say the opposite for that sample,\u201d said Steve Musser, deputy director for scientific operations in the FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Nutrition.  Earlier this month, J&J recalled around 33,000 bottles of baby powder in the United States after the FDA found trace amounts of asbestos in samples taken from a bottle purchased online.  \u201cRigorous and third-party testing confirms there is no asbestos in Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder. We stand by the safety of our product,\u201d J&J said in a statement. The company did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment on the FDA standing by its test result.  The different test outcomes could have resulted from the fact that contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and there is no standard test for asbestos in talc, FDA officials said.  The voluntary recall was limited to one lot of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, the company said at the time.  That move marked the first time the company recalled its iconic baby powder for possible asbestos contamination, and the first time U.S. regulators have announced a finding of asbestos in the product. Asbestos is a known carcinogen that has been linked to deadly mesothelioma.  J&J will not reverse the recall of those 22-ounce containers, but its baby powder remains available to consumers in stores, a company spokesman told Reuters.  The recall had been the latest blow to the more than 130-year-old U.S. healthcare conglomerate that is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including baby powder, opioids, medical devices and the antipsychotic Risperdal.

Teva, the world\u2019s largest generic drugmaker, said the settlement \u201cdoes not establish any wrongdoing on the part of the company\u201d and denied contributing to opioid abuse in Oklahoma.  Claims against Teva focused on the branded opioid products Actiq and Fentora as well as generic painkillers it produced.  The trial against Israel-based Teva, along with Johnson & Johnson, was set to begin on Tuesday. The lawsuit alleged the companies\u2019 marketing of the painkiller was to blame for the opioid epidemic.  In a statement, Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, a J&J subsidiary, said it had acted responsibly and was ready for trial. It said it disagreed with what it called Oklahoma\u2019s \u201coverly expansive theories\u201d of public nuisance law, and said they should not apply in this situation.  \u201cAt the same time, as with all litigation, if an appropriate resolution is possible that avoids the expense and uncertainty of a trial, we are always open to that option,\u201d the company said in a statement.  Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter has alleged that J&J and Teva, along with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, carried out deceptive marking campaigns that downplayed opioids\u2019 addictive risks while overstating their benefits.  The state also alleges the companies\u2019 actions created an oversupply of painkillers and a public nuisance that will cost $12.7 billion to $17.5 billion to remedy.  Oklahoma resolved its claims against Purdue Pharma LP in March for $270 million.  The Oklahoma case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in other opioid cases, particularly some 1,850 mostly municipal and state governments that have sued the same drugmakers in the federal court in Ohio.  \u201cTeva is pleased to put the Oklahoma case behind it and remains prepared to vigorously defend claims against the company, including the upcoming federal court trial in Cleveland where the majority of the cases are pending,\u201d the company said.  Attorney General Hunter\u2019s office said in a statement the money would be used to address the opioid crisis in Oklahoma and that the J&J case is still scheduled to go to trial on Tuesday before Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman.  \u201cNearly all Oklahomans have been negatively impacted by this deadly crisis and we look forward to Tuesday, where we will prove our case against Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries,\u201d Hunter said in a statement.","197":"March 14 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson:  * J&J SAYS CHAIRMAN AND CEO ALEX GORSKY\u2019S FY 2017 TOTAL COMPENSATION WAS $29.8 MILLION VERSUS $26.9 MILLION IN FY 2016 - SEC FILING  * J&J - CFO DOMINIC CARUSO\u2019S TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR 2017 WAS $11.7 MILLION VERSUS $11.3 MILLION IN 2016  * J&J - EVP, WORLDWIDE CHAIRMAN PHARMACEUTICALS JOAQUIN DUATO'S TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR 2017 WAS $19.4 MILLION VERSUS $10.1 MILLION IN 2016 Source text: (bit.ly\/2DnX08d) Further company coverage:","198":"(Reuters) - A Missouri jury on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N to pay a record $4.69 billion to 22 women who alleged the company's talc-based products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos and caused them to develop ovarian cancer.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/Illustration  The verdict is the largest J&J has faced to date over allegations that its talc-based products cause cancer.  The company is battling some 9,000 talc cases. J&J denies both that its talc products cause cancer and that they ever contained asbestos. It says decades of studies show its talc to be safe and has successfully overturned previous talc verdicts on technical legal grounds.  Thursday\u2019s massive verdict, handed down in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, was comprised of $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages, according to an online broadcast of the trial by Courtroom View Network.  J&J in a statement called the trial \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d and said it would appeal the decision.  J&J shares fell $1.31, or 1 percent, to $126.45 in after-hours trading following the punitive damages award. They had risen $1.52 during regular trading.  The jury\u2019s decision followed more than five weeks of testimony by nearly a dozen experts on both sides.  The women and their families said decades-long use of Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products caused their diseases. They allege the company knew its talc was contaminated with asbestos since at least the 1970s but failed to warn consumers about the risks.  \u201cJohnson & Johnson is deeply disappointed in the verdict, which was the product of a fundamentally unfair process,\u201d the company said in a statement. The company said it remained confident that its products do not contain asbestos or cause cancer.  \u201cEvery verdict against Johnson & Johnson in this court that has gone through the appeals process has been reversed and the multiple errors present in this trial were worse than those in the prior trials which have been reversed,\u201d J&J added, saying that it would pursue all available appellate remedies.  J&J has successfully overturned talc verdicts in the past, with appeals courts pointing to a 2017 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that limits where personal injury lawsuits can be filed.  Of the 22 women in the St. Louis trial, 17 were from outside Missouri, a state generally regarded as friendly towards plaintiffs. The practice of combining plaintiffs in such jurisdictions, commonly criticized as \u201cforum shopping\u201d by defendants, will be challenged on appeal.  Mark Lanier, the lawyer for the women, in a statement following the verdict called on J&J to pull its talc products from the market \u201cbefore causing further anguish, harm, and death from a terrible disease.\u201d  \u201cIf J&J insists on continuing to sell talc, they should mark it with a serious warning,\u201d Lanier said.  The majority of the lawsuits that J&J faces involve claims that talc itself caused ovarian cancer, but a smaller number of cases allege that contaminated talc caused mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure.  The cases that went to trial in St. Louis effectively combine those claims by alleging asbestos-contaminated talc caused ovarian cancer.  Previous talc trials have produced verdicts as large as $417 million. But that 2017 verdict by a California jury, as well as other verdicts in Missouri, was overturned on appeal, and challenges to at least another five verdicts are pending.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioned a study of various talc samples from 2009 to 2010, including of J&J\u2019s Baby Powder. No asbestos was found in any of the talc samples, the agency said.  But Lanier during the trial told jurors that the agency and other laboratories and J&J have used flawed testing methods that did not allow for the proper detection of asbestos fibers.  Talc, the world\u2019s softest rock, is a mineral closely linked to asbestos and the two substances can appear in close proximity in the earth.  Plaintiffs claim the two can become intermingled in the mining process, making it impossible to remove the carcinogenic substance. J&J denies those allegations, saying rigorous testing and purification processes ensure its talc is clean.","199":"A Pennsylvania state court jury on Friday found Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson not liable in a lawsuit by a New Jersey man who said the drugmakers failed to warn about internal bleeding risks associated with their blood thinner Xarelto.

Glenda Gray, co-lead investigator on the local leg of a J&J global trial, told Reuters South Africa expected to get batches of around 80,000 doses every seven to 14 days for the study, once it is approved.  The implementation study would be aimed at further evaluating J&J\u2019s vaccine in the field and would be akin to a phase IIIb study, Gray said. J&J\u2019s vaccine has already been tested in the global phase III trial involving more than 40,000 participants including over 6,000 in South Africa.  Gray\u2019s comments come days after the government paused the rollout of 1 million doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine and switched to the J&J shot to start protecting its health workers.  That decision was based on a small clinical trial that showed the AstraZeneca jab provided minimal protection against mild to moderate illness from the more contagious 501Y.V2 virus variant that is now dominant in the country. The government said on Wednesday it was considering selling or swapping AstraZeneca shots it had ordered.

Gray said: \u201cWe will get 80,000 (doses) every 7 to 14 days and then based on our ability to roll them out we will redeploy them.\u201d  She added that a critical next step was for J&J to get emergency use authorisation (EUA) in the United States for its vaccine.

J&J became the fourth drugmaker to settle claims ahead of the Federal Court trial against multiple manufacturers and distributors in Cleveland scheduled for later this month. The case is considered a bellwether for more than 2,600 lawsuits by state and local governments that are pending nationally.  \u201cThe settlement allows the company to avoid the resource demands and uncertainty of a trial as it continues to seek meaningful progress in addressing the nation\u2019s opioid crisis,\u201d J&J said in a statement.  \u201cThe company recognizes the opioid crisis is a complex public health challenge and is working collaboratively to help communities and people in need,\u201d it added.  Opioids were involved in 400,000 overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  J&J which formerly marketed the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, said the settlement includes no admission of liability.  The company will pay $10 million to Cuyahoga and Summit counties, reimburse $5 million of their legal and other expenses and provide $5.4 million to non-profit organizations that run opioid-related programs in the counties.  Mallinckrodt Plc finalized a $24 million settlement with the same two counties on Monday. Endo International Plc and Allergan Plc also settled with the two counties in August to avoid going to trial.  The remaining defendants in the Oct. 21 federal trial include McKesson Corp, AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd , Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Henry Schein Inc.  OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP succumbed to pressure from the lawsuits and filed for bankruptcy protection in September.  Some plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have compared the opioid cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998.  Earlier in the year, an Oklahoma judge ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $572.1 million to the state for its part in fueling an opioid epidemic by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers.  Purdue Pharma and Teva had settled claims by Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general for $270 million and $85 million, respectively.

Powell, discounting the risk that a trade war may throw a global recovery off track, said there were still \u201cseveral years\u201d of strong jobs and low inflation ahead for the United States, and that an era of stable growth may continue provided the Fed gets its policy decisions right.  \u201cHe reiterated the view of the economy as being strong, growing at a solid pace with recent inflation data as more or less encouraging, and he\u2019s taking the same stance he did in the last statement,\u201d Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.  \u201cHis takeaway was job market is strong, inflation is going to stay near 2 percent, that means two more hikes this year, in line with the dot plot.\u201d  Powell\u2019s comments come as investors focus more on company forecasts to assess the sustainability of earnings growth in the wake of escalating U.S.-China trade dispute.  Analysts have forecast a near 21 percent surge in second-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Helping bolster market optimism was Johnson & Johnson , which rose 4 percent after the healthcare giant beat quarterly profit estimates on strong demand for cancer drugs.  The stock gave the biggest boost the S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Netflix slumped 7.9 percent and was on track for its biggest one-day drop in two years after the company\u2019s quarterly subscriber growth missed expectations, fanning fears that its rapid expansion is slowing.  The stock, one the best performing this year, weighed the most on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.  At 11:19 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 17.26 points, or 0.07 percent, at 25,081.62, the S&P 500 was up 5.82 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,804.25 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 14.21 points, or 0.18 percent, at 7,819.93.  Three of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by 0.4 percent decline in energy stocks due to drop in U.S. crude oil prices. The top gainer was the materials index , which rose 0.9 percent.  UnitedHealth dropped 3.5 percent and was the biggest drag on Dow after the health insurer reported quarterly medical costs that were slightly higher than expectations.  Goldman Sachs slipped 1.3 percent after reporting trading results that were weaker than some rivals, with analysts pointing out that its better-than-expected profit was due to low-profile businesses such as investing and lending.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.49-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.69-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded six new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 46 new highs and 32 new lows.

J&J\u2019s investment comes a month after Arrowhead released data from an early trial testing ARO-HBV, dubbed \u201crevolutionary\u201d by analysts who also said the company was positioned to develop a functional cure for Hepatitis B.  It also follows the first U.S. approval for an RNAi drug - Alnylam Pharmaceuticals' ALNY.O Onpattro - in August that affirmed the gene-silencing class of drugs as a new frontier in the field of medicine.  J&J will make a $75 million equity investment in Arrowhead at $23 per share, a premium of about 24 percent to the stock\u2019s Wednesday close.

Arrowhead is also eligible to receive up to $1.6 billion in milestone payments for the Hepatitis B license and about $1.9 billion in option and milestone payments for the three additional treatments.  B.Riley FBR analyst Madhu Kumar compared the deal to the one French drugmaker Sanofi inked with Alnylam in 2014 here, adding likewise for Arrowhead the agreement is \"a demonstration of Big Pharma validation of their technology\".  Arrowhead said proceeds would be used to fund other treatments under development. The company is currently testing drugs for metabolic disorders, lung disease and cancer.  \u201cI view (the deal) as a pivot to transitioning from a small biotech company to a large pharmaceutical company,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Christopher Anzalone told Reuters.  Pasadena, California-based Arrowhead uses its proprietary Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiM) technology to develop RNAi medicines that treat diseases by targeting and silencing specific genetic material, thereby blocking the production of disease-causing proteins.  Hepatitis B, which affects an estimated 257 million people, is a life-threatening viral infection that attacks the liver and patients risk death from cirrhosis and liver cancer.

J&J said an emergency use listing is a prerequisite for supplying vaccines to the COVAX vaccine program, co-led by WHO, which aims to deliver doses to poor and middle-income countries.  The J&J vaccine is administered in a single dose and can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, a big selling point in countries with relatively weaker healthcare infrastructure.  The vaccine is under review by the U.S. health regulator, and a panel of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s experts are expected to discuss the vaccine\u2019s emergency use authorization next week.  The vaccine is being rolled out in South Africa, for the first time outside a major clinical trial.  J&J said last month the vaccine was 66% effective in preventing COVID-19 in a large late-stage global trial against multiple variants of the coronavirus. The level of protection of the vaccine varied from 72% in the United States, to 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa.  The company said the data delivered to WHO includes results from the late-stage trial.  J&J entered into an agreement in December in support of the COVAX program.  The company and Gavi, which also co-leads COVAX, expect to enter into an advance purchase agreement that would provide up to 500 million doses of the single-dose vaccine to COVAX through 2022, J&J said.","218":"(Reuters) - Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general on Thursday had dropped all but a single claim against Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd in a closely watched lawsuit alleging the drugmakers helped fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic.

REUTERS\/George Frey  The move by Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter came ahead of an upcoming May 28 trial, the first in the United States to result from roughly 2,000 lawsuits seeking to hold manufacturers of painkillers responsible for contributing to the epidemic.  Opioids were involved in a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017 in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Hunter dropped the claims after announcing last week that OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP had along with the wealthy Sackler family who own it reached a $270 million settlement.  The 2017 lawsuit accused the three companies of engaging in deceptive marketing that downplayed the addiction risk from opioids while overstating their benefits. The Sacklers were not defendants in the case. The companies deny wrongdoing.  Hunter said he would continue to bring a public nuisance claim against J&J and Teva but was dropping five other claims, including that they violated the Oklahoma Medicaid False Claims Act.  Hunter said dropping those claims would not impact the amount of damages the state is seeking. Hunter had been asking for more than $20 billion before Purdue\u2019s settlement.  J&J in a statement said the state\u2019s decision to drop most of its claims \u201cunderscores their lack of merit.\u201d It said the evidence at trial will show that the company appropriately marketed its pain medications.  Teva did not respond to a request for comment.  Hunter said the decision to refocus the case around the single claim that the companies caused a public nuisance that needs remediated will obviate efforts by the companies to delay the upcoming trial.  It will also transform what was to be a televised jury trial into a non-jury one in which a state court judge will decide the case, Hunter said.  \u201cThe team and I remain laser focused on the goal we set since filing this lawsuit: holding those responsible for creating this crisis accountable and bring an end to the opioid epidemic in Oklahoma,\u201d Hunter said.  More than 1,600 other opioid-related lawsuits are consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio, who has pushed for a settlement ahead of the trial before him in October.

FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Shares of J&J, the largest U.S. healthcare company by market value, had slumped 11.2 percent this year as of Friday's close, although recent gains may indicate the start of a rebound. The stock's year-to-date decline compares to more than 2 percent gains for both the S&P 500 healthcare sector .SPXHC and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, of which J&J is a member.  If J&J ends the year with its current 11.2 percent decline, 2018 will be the worst calendar-year performance in 25 years for the stock, a bellwether for the healthcare sector and one traditionally considered a safe-haven investment during periods of market uncertainty.  The diversified company, whose products include Band-Aid bandages, Tylenol pain reliever, replacement knees and cancer and immunology medicines, faces concerns in all three of its main segments - pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer.  But the stock\u2019s swoon makes it look particularly cheap, based on its price-to-earnings ratio of 14.8 times forward earnings estimates, which is enticing investors, along with the stock\u2019s above-market dividend yield of 2.9 percent.  \u201cWe are much more upbeat about J&J today than we were six months ago,\u201d said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York, as the stock traded just above $120 a share.  \u201cWe definitely think it\u2019s an attractive investment opportunity,\u201d Katz said.  J&J shares are up more than 3 percent in June, following five straight months of declines, the stock\u2019s longest such losing streak in over a decade.  J&J\u2019s pharmaceuticals segment, roughly half of company revenue, saw sales jump by 19 percent in the first quarter. But concerns about generic-drug competition eroding sales of prostate cancer medicine Zytiga, a standout in the first quarter, and rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade have investors leery about the segment\u2019s future performance.  Pharmaceuticals has been the strongest segment of J&J\u2019s businesses, but \u201cthe ability to sustain an above-average growth rate has been a question,\u201d said Dean Dillard, senior research analyst at USAA Investments in San Antonio.  J&J\u2019s medical devices segment including its orthopedics business has been losing market share, said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager focusing on healthcare for Gabelli & Co.  Performance in J&J\u2019s consumer segment has been \u201cpretty lackluster for a few quarters,\u201d Jonas said. The division also may be subject to weak investor sentiment in general for consumer brand companies, amid fierce competition and other concerns.  \u201cThere is concern around all three of the businesses,\u201d Jonas said.  (GRAPHIC: J&J shares in 2018: A stock in need of Tylenol - reut.rs\/2Mg5dRC)  J&J shares may also be suffering from concerns about scrutiny over prescription drug costs that are undermining pharmaceutical shares broadly.  \u201cSentiment remains fairly negative for the group, so that by and large does not help Johnson & Johnson,\u201d said Kevin Gade, a portfolio analyst, who follows pharmaceutical stocks at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati.  VALUATION ATTRACTIVE  The stock\u2019s recent valuation at 14.8 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months is its lowest since late 2015 and well below its five-year average of 16.5 times, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.  J&J is also trading at a nearly 10 percent discount to the S&P 500 .SPX, compared to the slight premium it has held over the benchmark index on average over the past five years.  Also appealing, investors said, is J&J\u2019s dividend yield of 2.9 percent compared to 1.9 percent for the S&P 500, as well as the company\u2019s track record of consistently raising it.  Aside from paying its dividend, some investors want J&J to use its cash for a stock buyback or for an acquisition to improve its growth prospects.  J&J is \u201ccapable of doing 10 $5 billion transactions. We don\u2019t have to do a $50 billion transaction,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso told an investor conference last week.  J&J\u2019s broad healthcare portfolio, which offers products that people will require even in economic down times, helps position it as a safe-haven stock in the event of market volatility or an increasingly uncertain economy.  \u201cIf and when the economy sees negative growth,\u201d Gade said, \u201crelative to the market, Johnson & Johnson is the type of company and business model an investor would want to hold.\u201d","220":"Feb 19 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Friday it had submitted for emergency use listing of its COVID-19 vaccine to the World Health Organization.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  While Ebola is a deadly and contagious disease, it is also still relatively rare, making the potential market for a vaccine sporadic and very likely unprofitable. This poses a dilemma for drug companies: With no real prospect of a financial return, can they justify the investment in expensive development and trials.  GSK\u2019s vaccine candidates - two designed to protect against Ebola and one against the Marburg virus - will be transferred to the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, D.C., the British drugmaker said in a statement. There is no financial element to the agreement, a spokesman said.  The transfer agreement will see Sabin continue to develop the candidate vaccines, one of which - a potential Ebola shot known as ChAd3 - has been through mid-stage, Phase II, trials in Africa and could possibly be used to halt or limit future Ebola epidemics.  \u201cEnabling Sabin to build on the scientific progress GSK has delivered up to Phase II increases the likelihood these candidate vaccines may help prevent potential future outbreaks,\u201d Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GSK Vaccines, said in a statement.  GSK had put its Ebola vaccine work on hold after it was unable to progress the product through final stage, or Phase III, clinical trials toward the end of the 2014-16 epidemic, due to a dwindling number of Ebola cases.  U.S. drugmakers Merck MRK.N and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N are also developing potential vaccines against Ebola, and have made more progress with them than GSK had in clinical trials.  The Merck shot, known as VSV EBOV, is currently being used in the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Congo, which was last month declared an international health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO).  The disease has killed more than 1,800 people in the Congo outbreak which began a year ago and has become the second-worst on record.  GSK said Sabin had agreed a collaboration deal with the Vaccine Research Center at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to further develop the vaccine candidates.  The ChAd3 shot was originally developed by NIAID in collaboration with the Swiss-based firm Okairos, which was bought by GSK in 2013. All three experimental vaccines have shown promise in safety trials after being administered to more than 5,000 adults and 600 children, GSK said.","227":"MADRID (Reuters) - Some volunteers have quit Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine trial in Spain after news of side effects in a participant in AstraZeneca\u2019s trial, the Spanish programme\u2019s lead investigator told Reuters on Tuesday.  Alberto Borobia, lead investigator of Hospital La Paz, poses for a picture before an interview with Reuters at La Paz hospital in Madrid, Spain, September 15, 2020. REUTERS\/Sergio Perez  The investigator, Alberto Borobia, said there were enough reserve volunteers for the trial to continue as normal, however.  \u201cMany have called to ask us some more detail about the risk of the vaccine, whether what happened with that vaccine had anything to do with the one we are studying, these types of questions,\u201d Borobia said.  He did not say how many people had dropped out.  AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine trials were placed on hold worldwide on Sept. 6 after a serious side effect was reported in one volunteer in Britain.  Trials resumed in Britain and Brazil on Monday following the green light from British regulators but remain on hold in the United States.  Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Belgian Janssen unit began Phase II trials of its COVID-19 vaccine on 190 people in Spain on Monday with those tests due to conclude on Sept. 22.  Trials are also being carried out in the Netherlands and Germany, taking the total number of participants in all three countries to 550.  Johnson & Johnson was one of nine companies to commit last week to uphold scientific standards in the race for a COVID-19 vaccine amid rising concerns that safety and efficacy standards might slip in the rush to halt the pandemic.  Phase II trials are designed to test which dose and schedule of a vaccine generates the most antibodies while Phase III tests the vaccine\u2019s efficacy. Borobia said Phase II was scheduled to run for 14 to 16 months.  If some doses and schedules generate considerable amounts of antibodies, an intermediate Phase III analysis could be conducted before the end of Phase II, Borobia said.  He said volunteers in the third phase would be far more diverse than for Phase II, which only involves people in good health, divided into those aged 18 to 55 and those 65 and above.  \u201cIn the third phase, we will include all types of people.

J&J\u2019s Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary, one of several mine operators involved in the study, developed a relationship with the U.S. National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health researchers to \u201ceven influence the conclusions\u201d through suggestions of \u201csubjective interpretations,\u201d according to a 1973 Windsor Minerals memo.  Peter Bicks, outside counsel for J&J, told Reuters in an email that for the Vermont study, company \u201crepresentatives acted in an \u2018educational and advisory capacity\u2019 to provide the researchers with a realistic study plan.\u201d  A 1979 article in the Journal of Environmental Pathology and Toxicology detailing the findings of the study was not good news for talc. It reported a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in \u201crespiratory cancer mortality\u201d among miners. A subsequent analysis of the underlying data published in 1988 determined that at least one of the workers died of mesothelioma, the cancer most closely associated with asbestos.  The proposal to study the health of miners of the Italian talc used in Baby Powder for decades came from William Ashton, J&J\u2019s longtime talc supply chief. Ashton had obtained a summary of miners\u2019 medical records compiled by an Italian physician, who also happened to control the country\u2019s talc exports.  J&J should use those records \u201cfor maximum benefit,\u201d Ashton said in a May 8, 1973, letter to Dr Gavin Hildick-Smith, J&J\u2019s director of medical affairs. \u201cIt seems to me that the Italian records give us the opportunity to fortify a position on talc safety.\u201d  At the time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was considering a limit on asbestos in talcs. In an Oct. 18, 1973, memo, Hildick-Smith advised J&J: \u201cThe risk\/benefit ratio of conducting an epidemiological study in these mines must be considered.\u201d  By early 1974, the study was a go. Hildick-Smith sent money to the Italian talc exporter-physician to hire a team of researchers. Hildick-Smith told the lead researcher in a June 26, 1974, letter exactly what J&J wanted: data that \u201cwould show that the incidence of cancer in these subjects is no different from that of the Italian population or the rural control group.\u201d  That is exactly what J&J got, Hildick-Smith told colleagues a few months later. At a meeting on Sept. 27, 1974, for a \u201cTalc\/powder Safety Studies Review,\u201d he reported the Italian study would dispel the \u201ccancer concern associated with exposure to talc.\u201d  The following spring, Hildick-Smith got a draft of the Italian study from the lead researcher. It needed work to meet the \u201cform and style\u201d requirements of the target journal, he told colleagues in a March 31, 1975, memo. He added that he would send it to a scientific ghostwriter \u201cwho will hold it in confidence and rewrite it.\u201d  The article that appeared in 1976 in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine reported results even better than J&J had bargained for. The study found fewer lung cancer deaths than expected, a result that the authors said supported \u201cthe thesis of no cancerogenic effect attributable to pure talc.\u201d  It also found no mesothelioma, the signature cancer of asbestos exposure. There is no evidence J&J manipulated or misused the data. Experts for plaintiffs have testified that the Italian study was too small to draw any conclusions about the incidence of such a rare cancer. J&J\u2019s expert witnesses have concluded the opposite.  Bicks noted that the Italian study has been updated three times \u2013 in 1979, 2003 and 2017 \u2013 \u201cconfirming the lack of association between exposure to asbestos-free talc, lung cancer and mesothelioma.\u201d  J&J got a lot of mileage out of the study. It was cited in a review article titled \u201cThe Biology of Talc,\u201d published Nov. 1, 1976, in the British Journal of Industrial Medicine. In addition to dozens of published studies, the review cited unpublished research, including one experiment that used a doll as a proxy for infants and that supported the company\u2019s position on the safety of talc. It didn\u2019t disclose that J&J had commissioned the unpublished research.  The author of the review article concluded that the \u201cconcern that has been expressed about the possible health hazard from consumer exposure to cosmetic talc is unwarranted \u2026 There is no evidence that its normal use poses a hazard to health.\u201d  The author was Hildick-Smith, the J&J physician executive who had overseen the Italian study and played a key role in the company\u2019s talc safety research. The article did not disclose his J&J connection, identifying him only as a Rutgers University clinical assistant professor. Hildick-Smith died in 2006.","229":"Feb 18 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson:  * JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO EXPAND PARTNERSHIP WITH U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES TO ACCELERATE THE DISCOVERY OF POTENTIAL COVID-19 TREATMENTS  * J&J - JANSSEN PHARMACEUTICAL TO EXPAND EXISTING PARTNERSHIP WITH BARDA TO SEEK TREATMENT SOLUTIONS FOR COVID-19, DISEASE CAUSED BY NOVEL CORONAVIRUS  * J&J - LATEST COLLABORATION TO ENHANCE JANSSEN\u2019S WORK TO SCREEN EXISTING ANTIVIRAL MOLECULES, TO IDENTIFY COMPOUNDS WITH PROMISING ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY AGAINST SARS-COV-2  * J&J - JANSSEN, BARDA TO SHARE RESEARCH,DEVELOPMENT COSTS & MOBILIZE RESOURCES TO SCREEN LIBRARY OF ANTIVIRAL MOLECULES FOR ACTIVITY AGAINST SARS-COV-2 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","230":"A federal appeals court has ruled that a patent related to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s blockbuster prostate cancer drug Zytiga was invalid, upholding court and agency rulings allowing generic versions of the drug.

The deposition has not been previously reported.  Gorsky, citing \u201cthousands of tests and studies\u201d to support his testimony, said: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of our baby powder or talc containing asbestos.\u201d  That\u2019s harder for him to say now. Last Wednesday, just 13 days after his deposition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration told the healthcare giant it had discovered asbestos, a known carcinogen, in a bottle of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder.  On Friday, a day after getting the full FDA test results, J&J recalled 33,000 bottles of Baby Powder in the United States. It marked the first time the company has recalled Baby Powder for possible asbestos contamination and the first time U.S. regulators have announced finding asbestos in the product.  The recall is the latest blow to a healthcare conglomerate that has for many years tried to project an image as a caring company. It is now facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including legal action by more than 15,000 consumers claiming its talc powders caused their cancers.  Shares in J&J, which in February said it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for documents related to the asbestos contamination allegations, dropped almost 6% on Friday after the recall was announced. The inquiries include a criminal grand jury investigation into how forthright J&J has been about the safety of its powders, according to people familiar with the matter.  In the deposition, Gorsky was pressed again and again to say - without qualification - that the company\u2019s powders were asbestos free. But in answering questions under oath for the first time in the talc litigation, he stuck to his statement that he \u201cbelieved\u201d J&J\u2019s powders were clean.  The FDA finding will make it much more difficult for Gorsky and the company to continue saying that they \u201cbelieve\u201d the talc powders are free from asbestos, said Elizabeth Burch, a product liability expert at the University of Georgia School of Law. She said the test result and recall lend credibility to what plaintiffs have been arguing in court for months.  J&J stands behind the safety of its talc and said it\u2019s investigating the FDA test result. The company said it proceeded with the recall \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d  In a statement on Sunday J&J said: \u201cThousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos, including prior tests by the FDA as recently as last month.\u201d  In a written response to questions from Reuters on Monday, J&J added that Gorsky had no knowledge of the FDA finding of asbestos at the time of his deposition.  The company also said the FDA notified it on Sept. 20 that a test of its Baby Powder did not find any asbestos. Neither had the regulator detected asbestos during testing in 2010 using the \u201cmost sophisticated testing techniques available.\u201d  COULD BE DEPOSED AGAIN  Gorsky\u2019s testimony echoed statements he made after Reuters on Dec. 14 last year published an investigation that found J&J knew for decades asbestos lurked in its talc.  FILE PHOTO: Johnson & Johnson\u00d5s Chief Executive Alex Gorsky speaks during a recorded deposition in New York, U.S. October 3, 2019. Simmons Hanly Conroy\/Handout via REUTERS.  Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company\u2019s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, the Reuters investigation found. Company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it, while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.  Jim Kramer, the lawyer who deposed Gorsky this month, said he plans to ask the New York state judge in the case to allow him to question the CEO a second time in light of the FDA\u2019s findings and the recall.  J&J declined to comment on the possibility of a second round with Kramer or about its legal strategy following the FDA test result.  Gorsky faces at least one more deposition, this one ordered by a Missouri judge for Baby Powder cancer cases pending in that state. That has yet to be scheduled.  DISCUSSED DROPPING TALC POWDERS  In his daylong videotaped deposition, Gorsky, a former Army Ranger, recounted his efforts to stem the growing controversy over one of the company\u2019s signature products.  Sitting at the head of a conference table with the blinds drawn in the midtown Manhattan offices of a mediation firm, he testified that J&J considered dropping talc powders.  \u201cWe had discussions internally along the way regarding should we leave \u2026 talc on the market or not,\u201d Gorsky said at the deposition.  In the end, however, Gorsky said the company, which also sells Baby Powder made from cornstarch, stuck with talc because it was confident about its safety and because many consumers liked its feel.  \u201cWe had the right testing procedures in place and so there was \u2026 no medical reason or safety reason to withdraw it,\u201d he testified.  \u201cThere were in fact differences between cornstarch and talc-based baby powder in its feel, in its absorbency,\u201d said Gorsky, who has been J&J\u2019s CEO since 2012. The company \u201cfelt it was important to have different options on the market based upon different consumer needs.\u201d  The plaintiff\u2019s lawyer pressed the 59-year-old Gorsky on his use of the word \u201cbelieve\u201d when asked about asbestos in J&J\u2019s talc. \u201cMy follow up is,\u201d Kramer said, \u201ccan you not answer the question as I\u2019ve presented it with a yes or a no?\u201d  Gorsky, who said in the deposition he uses Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder and had also used it on his son, didn\u2019t budge. \u201cI did not personally conduct every single test. I can only \u2026 gauge it based upon the data and totality that\u2019s been presented to me.\u201d  In its answers to Reuters questions on Monday, the company reiterated that \u201cMr. Gorsky is not a scientist and did not conduct the tests. He therefore relies on others to advise him.\u201d  Before the FDA test result, Gorsky\u2019s focus on what he \u201cbelieved\u201d to be true was helpful to J&J\u2019s legal position, said Andrew Bradt, a Berkeley Law professor at the University of California. Many state laws require plaintiffs to prove companies knew a product was defective, and if Gorsky had unequivocally said talc does not contain asbestos then opposing lawyers could seek to undermine his declaration by contrasting it with the results of tests J&J knew about over the years suggesting otherwise.  However, in light of the FDA asbestos discovery, plaintiff lawyers could now make it sound like he was being hesitant in his deposition, Bradt said.  \u2018MAD MONEY\u2019  Much of the testimony centered on Gorsky\u2019s efforts to quell public and investor concerns raised by the Dec. 14 Reuters investigation and a story published hours later in the New York Times. The Reuters report had prompted a stock selloff that erased about $40 billion from the company\u2019s market value in one day.  In the subsequent days, J&J tweeted, posted on Facebook, ran a series of full-page newspaper ads, published a lengthy rebuttal to the Reuters investigation on its website and announced a $5 billion stock buyback.  In video posted in December and still featured on J&J\u2019s website, Gorsky emphasized that regulators \u201chave always found our talc to be asbestos free.\u201d  Jim Cramer, the host of the CNBC investing show \u201cMad Money,\u201d gave Gorsky the chance to present his side of the story last December, according to copies of emails shown at the deposition.  Hours after the Reuters and New York Times articles were published, Cramer sent a message to Gorsky\u2019s work email, saying: \u201cDear Alex, if you feel these talc stories are not truthful, I would love to know how to refute them! \u2013 all the best, Jim.\u201d  And that evening, Cramer sent a followup: \u201cThank you, Alex. Do not be afraid to overwhelm me. I will work all weekend to tell the truth about your great company!!! -Jim.\u201d  Gorsky appeared in person in the \u201cMad Money\u201d studio the following Monday, Dec. 17.  \u201cWe want to make sure that our trust and integrity that we\u2019ve earned over the last 130 years is maintained for the next 130 years,\u201d he told viewers.  \u201cWe unequivocally believe that our talc, our Baby Powder, does not contain asbestos,\u201d Gorsky said on the broadcast.  In an email to Reuters, Cramer said his goal \u201cwas to get Alex Gorsky on CNBC first and to ask all the toughest questions \u2026 There were no ground rules and nothing was off the table.\u201d At the end of the Dec. 17 broadcast, there was a disclosure that Cramer\u2019s charitable trust owned J&J shares.  It still has a stake today, Cramer said.  TESTING ACCURACY  When the question of previous test results came up in the deposition, Gorsky said occasional findings of asbestos in talc haven\u2019t held up under scrutiny. Such tests were subsequently found to be \u201cincomplete or inaccurate,\u201d he said.  A New Jersey judge overseeing thousands of talc lawsuits consolidated in a federal court is expected to rule soon on a J&J request to disqualify expert witnesses hired by plaintiffs, including the head of an asbestos testing lab who testified in earlier trials that he found the contaminant in the company\u2019s powders.  In a filing Friday, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers drew the judge\u2019s attention to the FDA finding of asbestos in the bottle of Baby Powder and said they have asked J&J to turn over documents related to the FDA test results and any communications with regulators.  In a brief conference call Friday with analysts and journalists, J&J officials called the FDA test results \u201cextremely unusual,\u201d and suggested the sample may have been contaminated by an outside source or come from a counterfeit bottle.  A few hours later, the FDA shot back with a defense of its laboratory analysis, saying it wasn\u2019t aware of \u201cany records pointing to counterfeit Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder in the U.S. market.\u201d  The FDA declined to provide further comment for this article.","241":"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis is getting its third oncology chief in less than a year after Liz Barrett said on Thursday she was leaving the Swiss drugmaker to become chief executive of a U.S. biotech firm only 11 months after taking up the role.

J&J shares fell nearly 3 percent Monday, closing at $129.14 in New York Stock Exchange trading. That drop was on top of the 10 percent plunge that wiped out about $40 billion of the company's market capitalization following the Reuters report here Friday. J&J also announced Monday that it would be repurchasing up to $5 billion of its common stock.  Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, on Friday sent a letter to the head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration calling on the agency to investigate the findings in the Reuters report to determine whether J&J misled regulators and whether its Baby Powder products threaten public health and safety.  J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky, in his first interview since the Reuters article was published, defended the company during an appearance on CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money\u201d with host Jim Cramer on Monday night. J&J knew for decades about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its products dating back to as early as 1971, a Reuters examination of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents showed. In response to the report, J&J said on Friday that \u201cany suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.\u201d  A Monday full-page ad from J&J -- headlined \u201cScience. Not sensationalism.\u201d -- ran in newspapers including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The ad asserted that J&J has scientific evidence its talc is safe and beneficial to use. \u201cIf we had any reasons to believe our talc was unsafe, it would be off our shelves,\u201d the ad said.  J&J rebutted Reuters\u2019 report in a lengthy written critique of the article and a video from Gorsky. In the written critique, posted on the company\u2019s website here, J&J said Reuters omitted information it supplied to the news organization that demonstrated the healthcare conglomerate\u2019s Baby Powder is safe and does not cause cancer; that J&J\u2019s baby powder has repeatedly been tested and found to be asbestos-free; and that the company has cooperated with the U.S. FDA and other regulators around the world to provide information requested over decades.  \u201cSince tests for asbestos in talc were first developed, J&J\u2019s Baby Powder has never contained asbestos,\u201d Gorsky said in the video here. He added that regulators \u201chave always found our talc to be asbestos-free.\u201d  A Reuters spokeswoman on Monday said the agency \u201cstands by its reporting.\u201d  Reuters\u2019 investigation found that while most tests in past decades found no asbestos in J&J talc and talc products, tests on Baby Powder conducted by scientists at Mount Sinai Medical Center in 1971 and Rutgers University in 1991, as well as by labs for plaintiffs in cancer lawsuits, found small amounts of asbestos. In 1972, a University of Minnesota scientist found what he called \u201cincontrovertible asbestos\u201d in a sample of Shower to Shower. Other tests by J&J\u2019s own contract labs and others periodically found small amounts of asbestos in talc from mines that supplied the mineral for Baby Powder and other cosmetic products into the early 2000s.  FILE PHOTO: Bottles of Johnson & Johnson baby powder line a drugstore shelf in New York October 15, 2015. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  The company did not report to the FDA three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 that found asbestos in the company\u2019s talc.  The Reuters story drew no conclusions about whether talc itself causes ovarian cancer. Asbestos, however, is a carcinogen. The World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer has listed asbestos-contaminated talc as a carcinogen since 1987. Reuters also found that J&J tested only a fraction of the talc powder it sold. The company never adopted a method for increasing the sensitivity of its tests that was recommended to the company by consultants in 1973 and in a published report in a peer-review scientific journal in 1991.  The ad J&J ran in newspapers Monday also pointed to an online talc fact page the company created with \u201cindependent studies from leading universities, research from medical journals and third-party opinions.\u201d  That website has changed since early December, according to a Reuters review of online archives.  The website, for instance, no longer contains a section headlined \u201cConclusions from Global Authorities\u201d that as recently as Dec. 5 listed organizations including the U.S. FDA, the European Union and Health Canada as among entities that have \u201creviewed and analyzed all available data and concluded that the evidence is insufficient to link talc use to cancer.\u201d  On Dec. 14, the day Reuters published its report, that section of the website had been removed. It is not clear exactly when the online page changed.  The Canadian government released a draft report this month that found a \u201cconsistent and statistically significant positive association\u201d between talc exposure and ovarian cancer. The draft report also said that talc meets criteria to be deemed toxic.  The draft report put forth proposed conclusions that are subject to a public comment period and confirmation in a so-called final screening assessment, Health Canada said.  If the conclusions are confirmed, Canadian officials will consider adding talc to a government list of toxic substances and implementing measures to prohibit or restrict use of talc in some cosmetics, non-prescription drugs and natural health products, Health Canada said.  A J&J spokeswoman said the company removed the website section after the Canadian government issued the draft report. \u201cWe chose to be conservative while that draft is under review,\u201d the spokeswoman said.  While J&J has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, the products contributed less than 0.5 percent of J&J\u2019s $76.5 billion in revenue last year.","252":"Nov 15 (Reuters) - An Oklahoma judge on Friday said Johnson & Johnson only needs to pay $465 million of the $572 million he previously concluded it owed the state for fueling the opioid epidemic through deceptive painkiller marketing.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Attorneys general of 46 U.S. states announced the settlement agreement in statements on Tuesday. They alleged DePuy engaged in unfair and deceptive practices in the promotion of its ASR XL and Pinnacle Ultamet hip implant devices.  DePuy in a statement said the settlement involves no admission of liability or misconduct on the part of the companies.  \u201cDePuy Synthes remains committed to meeting the current and future needs of orthopedic surgeons and patients,\u201d the company said.  The states claimed J&J made misleading claims about the longevity of its metal-on-metal hip implants, with patients frequently having to undergo a revision surgery before the company\u2019s advertised timeframe of five years.  Under Tuesday\u2019s settlement agreement, DePuy is required to maintain a post-market surveillance program and update procedures to track complaints over the hip implants, according to a statement by New York Attorney General Letitia James.  DePuy in 2010 announced a worldwide voluntary recall of 93,000 of its ASR hip implant systems, saying that 12 percent of them failed within five years. Saying it would pay at least $2.47 billion, the company has since settled thousands of lawsuits by patients who had to have the ASR implant removed.  In 2013, DePuy ceased selling the Pinnacle devices after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations.  Metal-on-metal hip implants have also come under scrutiny over allegations that the products cause a build-up of metal ions in the blood, causing groin pain, allergic reactions, bone erosion and tissue death.  The company faces some 10,400 lawsuits in the United States over its Pinnacle device in connection with those claims.  J&J denies consumer claims related to its Pinnacle products, saying the company acted appropriately and responsibly in the development, testing, and marketing of the devices.","254":"A Kentucky appeals court has affirmed the dismissal of a lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Biosense unit over a heart catheter that injured a man during a clinical trial, saying the claims were preempted by federal law.

FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The jury ordered the companies to pay an additional $80 million in punitive damages to Stephen Lanzo after awarding him and his wife $37 million in compensatory damages during the first stage of the trial last Thursday.  The verdict by jurors in New Brunswick, New Jersey, came in the second trial nationally to focus on claims that J&J\u2019s talc products contained asbestos as the company separately fights thousands of cases claiming they can also cause ovarian cancer.  Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay $55 million and the Imerys unit $25 million of the punitive damages award, according to an online broadcast of the trial by Courtroom View Network.  The decision marks the first trial loss for J&J over allegations that its talc-based consumer products, such as Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder, contain asbestos. The company denies the allegations, saying its powders do not contain asbestos or cause cancer.  J&J in a statement said it would continue to defend the safety of its Baby Powder and immediately begin appealing the verdict, adding that it had been prevented from presenting important evidence to the jury.  \u201cAfter suffering multiple losses through court rulings and at trial, plaintiff\u2019s attorneys have shifted their strategy and are now alleging that talcum powder is contaminated with asbestos,\u201d the company said.  Imerys Talc America in a statement said it planned to appeal the decision, adding that it stood behind the safety of its products. \u201cThe evidence is clear that (Lanzo\u2019s) asbestos exposure came from different sources,\u201d the company said.  The lawsuit was brought by New Jersey resident Stephen Lanzo, who said he developed mesothelioma after inhaling dust that was generated through his regular use of J&J talc powder products since his birth in 1972.  Mesothelioma is a deadly form of cancer closely associated with exposure to asbestos. It affects the delicate tissue that lines body cavities, most often around the lungs but also in the abdomen and elsewhere.  Last Thursday, the jury awarded Lanzo $30 million and his wife Kendra $7 million in compensatory damages. It found J&J was responsible for 70 percent of the damages and said the unit of France-based Imerys SA, its talc supplier, was responsible for 30 percent.  \u201cWe are gratified that justice was achieved and that our clients will be fairly compensated,\u201d Moshe Maimon, who represented the Lanzos, said in a statement  J&J shares closed down 0.5 percent.  New Brunswick-based J&J faces talc-related lawsuits by 6,610 plaintiffs nationally, largely based on claims it failed to warn women about the risk of developing ovarian cancer by using its products for feminine hygiene.  In five trials in Missouri involving ovarian cancer lawsuits, juries found J&J liable four times and awarded the plaintiffs a total of $307 million. In California, a jury awarded a now-deceased woman $417 million.  But in October, a Missouri appellate court threw out the first verdict there for $72 million and a California judge tossed the $417 million verdict. J&J is seeking to reverse the other verdicts.

It will also use the wartime powers to increase at-home COVID-19 tests, and make more surgical gloves in the United States, officials said at a Friday media briefing.  \u201cAs is the case with other vaccines, we have not found that the level of manufacturing allows us to have as much vaccine as we think we need coming out of the gate,\u201d said Andy Slavitt, senior adviser to the White House\u2019s COVID-19 response team, referring to the J&J vaccine.  J&J applied on Thursday for U.S. emergency use authorization. It expects to have some vaccine ready for distribution as soon as authorized but has not said how much.  Emergent Biosolutions\u2019 Chief Executive Robert Kramer said in an interview on Friday that the company currently is making bulk drug substance for J&J \u201cat large scale.\u201d Emergent is only producing bulk vaccine, which is then filled into syringes or vials and packaged for shipment by another contractor.

Kramer said his company had already benefited from the Defense Production Act under the Trump Administration, which helped the company get to the point where it\u2019s ready to go.  Under the authority of the Defense Production Act, the government will give priority ratings to two components important to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine production - filling pumps and tangential flow filtration units, the officials said.  \u201cWe told you that when we heard of a bottleneck on needed equipment, supplies, or technology related to vaccine supply that we would step in and help, and we were doing just that,\u201d said Tim Manning, the supply chain coordinator for the national COVID-19 response.  The government will also invoke its powers under the Defense Production Act to increase at-home COVID-19 tests with six, unnamed manufacturers, aiming to produce 61 million tests by the summer, Manning said.  It will also invoke its powers to increase the nation\u2019s supply of surgical gloves, which are made almost exclusively overseas.  Manning said the government will build factories that make the raw materials for surgical gloves and help build plants in the United States to make the gloves.  By the end of the year, he said, the United States would be able to produce a billion gloves a month.  Officials have said that once J&J\u2019s vaccine is authorized, it would mean that millions more doses would be available to states. The vaccine is one-shot, as opposed to Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna Inc\u2019s two-dose vaccines, and can be stored in a refrigerator.  Officials have hoped that the ease of giving the J&J vaccine will mean that states will be able to more quickly immunize residents.","268":"NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson Chief Executive Alex Gorsky on Monday faced questions from plaintiffs lawyers over the timing of his sale of company stock, as he testified for the first time in a jury trial over allegations that the company\u2019s Baby Powder causes cancer.  Gorsky told the jury that he had sold company shares in November 2018, two days after a Reuters reporter contacted the company and summarized in an email her review of documents that showed J&J knew small amounts of asbestos had been found in its talc on occasion since 1971.  Gorsky testified that he was not shown the email from the Reuters reporter at the time of the stock sale.  On Dec. 14, 2018, Reuters published the story that showed J&J had failed to disclose that small amounts of asbestos, a known carcinogen, had sometimes been found in its talc over several decades. After the Reuters report was published, a selloff wiped out more than $40 billion from the company\u2019s market value.  At the time, J&J dismissed the Reuters\u2019 report as \u201can absurd conspiracy theory.\u201d  \u201cMy trade took place at a time when I did not have that kind of knowledge about the article,\u201d Gorsky said on Monday. Gorsky testified that he followed all of the appropriate approval processes with the company\u2019s board of directors and legal team regarding the sale of company shares after exercising stock options.  J&J faces more than 16,000 lawsuits alleging it sold powders contaminated with asbestos and failed to warn users. It also faces a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about the products\u2019 safety.  Filings made by J&J to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show that Gorsky sold $38.6 million of company stock on Nov. 16, two days after Reuters made its findings known to the company.  On Monday, Gorsky acknowledged that his net proceeds totaled about $22 million. In response to questions from a lawyer representing J&J, Gorsky reiterated that he had not been told about the Reuters email in advance of the stock sale.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  He also acknowledged that he sold less than 10% of his holdings in the company in that transaction and that the shares would be worth more now if he had held onto them.  A J&J spokesman said that Gorsky had notified the company\u2019s legal department about the planned sale on Nov. 12, 2018, two days before the Reuters inquiry. The stock sale was prompted by plans to buy a house, he said.  The spokesman provided no further details, and Reuters could not independently confirm the purchase.  RELIED ON EXPERTS  Gorsky was subpoenaed by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers as a witness in a trial playing out in a courtroom near J&J headquarters. The plaintiffs, three men and one woman, all have mesothelioma, a rare and incurable cancer that they allege was caused by their exposure to asbestos in Baby Powder in infancy during their diapering.  During an earlier liability phase of the trial, a jury awarded $37.2 million in compensatory damages. Now plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are seeking to persuade a new jury that J&J failed to do enough to ensure the purity of its product, and therefore additional punitive damages should be awarded.  \u201cI was told by the experts in their fields that we were using the most appropriate, most up-to-date technology to make sure our talc was safe,\u201d Gorsky testified.  In response to a question posed by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, Gorsky also told the jury he did not read all the internal company documents related to potential asbestos contamination in Baby Powder, including those contained in links in the Reuters report.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cI did not read all the documents, but I would rely on the experts in these fields,\u201d Gorsky testified.  J&J had fought against the subpoena, arguing that its CEO had no first-hand knowledge about the safety of its powders and that the case involves corporate conduct that occurred long before he joined the company.  Compelling his testimony \u201cwould serve no purpose other than to harass Mr. Gorsky and divert him from his executive responsibilities,\u201d J&J said in a motion.  The New Jersey Supreme Court turned down the company\u2019s request to suspend the subpoena last week.  In October, J&J disclosed that a contract lab for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had found asbestos in a bottle of Baby Powder produced in 2018. The company questioned the finding and commissioned tests on samples from the same bottle and talc from the same lot.  Less than two weeks later, J&J announced those tests had found no asbestos, other than some contamination it blamed on an air conditioner in the lab.  Gorsky\u2019s journey to the witness stand can be traced to the lead role he played in company efforts to rebut the Reuters report, which prompted plaintiffs lawyers to subpoena his testimony.  In the days following publication, the CEO personally attested to the safety and purity of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder in a video posted on the company\u2019s website, as well as in an appearance on CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money.\u201d  \u201cWe unequivocally believe that our talc, our Baby Powder, does not contain asbestos,\u201d Gorsky told the investment show\u2019s host Jim Cramer.","269":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Clinical trial data on two COVID-19 vaccines show that a coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa is lessening their ability to protect against the illness, underscoring the need to vaccinate vast numbers of people as quickly as possible, scientists said.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  The vaccines from Novavax Inc and Johnson & Johnson were welcomed as important future weapons in curbing deaths and hospitalizations in a pandemic that has infected more than 101 million people and claimed over 2 million lives worldwide.  But they were significantly less effective at preventing COVID-19 in trial participants in South Africa, where the potent new variant is widespread, compared with countries in which this mutation is still rare, according to preliminary data released by the companies.  \u201cClearly, the mutants have a diminishing effect on the efficacy of the vaccines,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said in a briefing. \u201cWe can see that we are going to be challenged.\u201d  Novavax reported midstage trial results on Thursday that showed its vaccine was 50% effective overall at preventing COVID-19 among people in South Africa.  That compared with late-stage results from the United Kingdom, in which the vaccine was up to 89.3% effective at preventing COVID-19.  On Friday, J&J said a single shot of its coronavirus vaccine was 66% effective overall in a massive trial across three continents.  But there were wide differences by region. In the United States, where the South African variant was first reported this week, efficacy reached 72%, compared with just 57% in South Africa, where the new variant, known as B 1.351, made up 95% of the COVID-19 cases reported in the trial.  Another highly transmissible variant first discovered in the UK and now in more than half of U.S. states has been less able to evade vaccine efficacy than its South African counterpart.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The new findings, however, raise questions about how highly-effective vaccines from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech, and Moderna Inc will fare against new variants. The two vaccines showed an efficacy of around 95% in trials conducted primarily in the United States before the new virus versions were identified in other countries.  \u201cIt\u2019s a different pandemic now,\u201d said Dr. Dan Barouch, a researcher at Harvard University Medical School\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who helped develop the J&J vaccine.  Barouch said there are now a wide variety of new variants circulating, including in Brazil, South Africa and even the United States, that are substantially resistant to vaccine-induced antibodies.  Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said there was \u201ca high possibility\u201d that emerging variants may eventually render the company\u2019s vaccine ineffective.  \u201cThis is not the case yet ... but I think it\u2019s a very high likelihood that one day that will happen,\u201d Bourla said at the World Economic Forum. The drugmaker is considering whether its vaccine needs to be altered to defend against the South African variant.  \u2018STOP HOSPITALS FROM GOING INTO CRISIS\u2019  Experts said that all four vaccines still have great value in their ability to reduce severe COVID-19.  \u201cThe end game is to stop death, to stop hospitals from going into crisis - and all of these vaccines, even including against the South African variant, seem to do that substantially,\u201d said Dr. Amesh Adalja, in infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security  For example, J&J\u2019s vaccine was 89% effective at preventing severe disease in South Africa.  J&J Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Paul Stoffels said he suspects a type of immune system reaction called a T-cell response is playing a protective role and may be helping to prevent severe disease.  \u201cWe knew that to a certain extent, but it\u2019s also better and very confirming that we can see that now in the clinic,\u201d Stoffels said in an interview.  Nevertheless, Fauci said the decreased efficacy rates underscore the need to follow variants closely, and to accelerate vaccination efforts before new, and even more dangerous, mutations arise.  \u201cThe best way to prevent further evolution of a virus is to prevent it from replicating,\u201d Fauci said, \u201cand you do that by vaccinating people as quickly as you possibly can.\u201d","270":"FILE PHOTO: Bottles of prescription painkiller OxyContin, 40mg pills, made by Purdue Pharma L.D. sit on a shelf at a local pharmacy, in Provo, Utah, U.S., April 25, 2017.

(Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)","272":"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Thursday kicked off U.S. human safety trials for its COVID-19 vaccine after releasing details of a study in monkeys that showed its best-performing vaccine candidate offered strong protection in a single dose.  When exposed to the virus, six out of six animals who got the vaccine candidate were completely protected from lung disease and five out of six were protected from infection as measured by the presence of virus in nasal swabs, according to the study published in the journal Nature.  \u201cThis gives us confidence that we can test a single-shot vaccine in this epidemic and learn whether it has a protective effect in humans,\u201d Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J\u2019s chief scientific officer, told Reuters in a telephone interview.  The drugmaker said it had started early-stage human trials in the United States and Belgium and would test its vaccine candidate in more than 1,000 healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years, as well as adults aged 65 years and older.  The U.S. government is backing J&J\u2019s vaccine effort with $456 million in funding as part of a spending spree aimed at speeding production of a vaccine to end the pandemic, which has infected millions and killed more than 660,000 people.  Stoffels said prior tests of this type of vaccine in other diseases found that a second shot significantly increases protection. But in a pandemic a single-shot vaccine has a significant advantage, sidestepping a lot of the logistical issues involved in getting people to come back for their second dose.  The company plans to take up the question of one or two doses in its phase 1 trial.  Depending on those results, J&J plans to start large-scale, phase 3 testing with a single-shot regimen in the second half of September. Around the same time, the company will start a parallel phase 3 study testing a two-shot regimen of the vaccine, Stoffels said.  \u201cThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine is exciting because it\u2019s a single dose,\u201d White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator Deborah Birx said in an interview with Fox News.  Having one dose \u201cshow protection in monkeys like the other vaccines have shown with two doses does shorten the time period for development because your readout becomes 30 days quicker,\u201d she said.  J&J\u2019s vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26, or Ad26, to ferry coronavirus proteins into cells in the body, causing the body to mount an immune defense against the virus.  In the monkey study, scientists from J&J and Harvard\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center studied seven different potential vaccines in 32 animals and compared the results to 20 control animals who got placebo shots.  Six weeks later, all of the animals were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. All 20 animals that received the placebo developed high levels of virus in their lungs and nasal swabs.  In the best-performing candidate, which J&J selected for human testing, none of the animals had virus in their lungs and only one showed low levels of virus in nasal swabs. Lab tests showed they all had developed antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus after a single shot.  \u201cThis study shows that even just a single immunization with the Ad26 vaccine leads to neutralizing antibody responses and robust protection of monkeys against COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Beth Israel Deaconness who led the research in collaboration with J&J.  J&J shares were up nearly 2% at $149.93 before the market open on Thursday.","273":"NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.

The United States also has the option of purchasing an additional 200 million doses.  The company said it has doses ready for delivery upon emergency approval. It aims to deliver 1 billion doses in 2021 with production in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India.  In J&J\u2019s trial of nearly 44,000 volunteers conducted in eight countries, the level of protection against COVID-19 was 72% in the United States, 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa where variants are circulating.

Large-scale trials are set to start by the beginning of October and J&J aims to have results on the vaccine\u2019s efficacy between the end of this year and mid-2021, Johan Van Hoof, head of vaccines at Janssen, told Reuters on Tuesday in a telephone interview.  Earlier on Tuesday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia had become the first country to grant regulatory approval to a COVID-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing, and before large-scale trials had been conducted.  Van Hoof said that production of the vaccine had already begun despite the financial risks involved, to make sure it would be available as soon as possible should it prove effective against the new coronavirus.  Several million doses will be ready by the beginning of 2021, with a total capacity of 1 billion shots by the end of the year, he said. He added that the company was likely to favour a single-jab approach, although a final decision on whether a booster would be needed had not yet been made.  ETHICAL ISSUES  Outcomes of large-scale, or Phase III, trials will depend on the incidence of infections, Van Hoof said, with faster results expected with higher virus transmission.  That is why J&J is likely to conduct those trials in the United States and Latin America, the world\u2019s regions currently with the highest number of cases.  If infections drop significantly, J&J is also considering so-called challenge trials, in which volunteers are infected with the virus so that a vaccine candidate can be tested on them.  \u201cWe are looking into that possibility,\u201d Van Hoof said, noting though that such trials posed ethical issues that needed to be resolved before they could be conducted. For instance, an effective therapy against the disease should be available to minimise risks for volunteers exposed to the virus.  In May British drugmaker AstraZeneca AZN.L, which is developing a leading coronavirus vaccine with Oxford University, said it was too early to deliberately expose trial participants to the pathogen, but that may become an option if ongoing tests hit a snag.  Van Hoof said that preparations to stock the virus for possible challenge trials were already underway and J&J was part of ongoing discussions with universities and other bodies involved in these projects.  \u201cWe find it a very interesting idea,\u201d he said, adding however, that setting up facilities for such trials would perhaps take longer than testing vaccines on people who are already infected in the community - as long as transmission remained relatively high.","277":"FILE PHOTO: A vial and sryinge are seen in front of a displayed Johnson&Johnson logo in this illustration taken January 11, 2021.

More than 9,700 of those cases involve claims over ovarian cancer, recent filings in New Jersey federal court, where most of the cases are consolidated, showed.  The remaining plaintiffs allege asbestos in J&J\u2019s talc caused them to develop mesothelioma.  J&J in a statement on Wednesday said it was pleased with the jury\u2019s decision in the case of Allen.  \u201cWhile we deeply sympathize with anyone suffering from any form of cancer, the science and facts show that her disease was not caused by her use of our talcum-based products,\u201d the company said.  The California jury reached its decision following a roughly seven-week long jury trial, court records showed, but further details were not immediately available.  Lawyers for Allen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  J&J has been fighting talc cancer lawsuits for several years, but the litigation shifted in recent months to include allegations of asbestos contamination.  Plaintiffs now claim asbestos fibers in the products are causing both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.  J&J to date has been cleared of liability in three mesothelioma cases. It has lost two mesothelioma cases in New Jersey and California, with juries awarding a total of $142 million in damages. Both cases are under appeal.  Four additional mesothelioma cases resulted in a mistrial because jurors could not reach a verdict or because the plaintiff died.  In July, a Missouri jury hit J&J with a massive $4.69 billion verdict in the first trial alleging asbestos contamination has caused ovarian cancer in 22 women. That decision is also under appeal.","279":"BRUSSELS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. firm Johnson & Johnson is likely to apply for EU approval for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate in February, a top lawmaker said on Wednesday.  \u201cEU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides announced during our (EU lawmakers) group meeting this morning that the vaccine manufacturer Johnson & Johnson is likely to submit an application for approval to the EU for their vaccine in February,\u201d said Peter Liese, who represents health matters for the EU\u2019s centre-right group, the assembly\u2019s largest.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  J&J faces more than 16,000-talc related lawsuits nationwide, the majority of which are pending before U.S. District Judge Freda Wolfson in New Jersey. The lawsuits allege that the company\u2019s talc products have been contaminated with asbestos and can cause ovarian cancer.  The company had sought to bar all of the plaintiffs\u2019 experts from testifying, which would have effectively wiped out all the cases before Wolfson.  \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased,\u201d said Leigh O\u2019Dell, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. \u201cThe decision states, in a nutshell, that plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts are going to be able to testify that talcum powder can cause ovarian cancer.\u201d  J&J said in a statement that Monday\u2019s decision \u201cis not a determination by the court on the validity of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations.\u201d It added that all verdicts against the company in talc lawsuits that had gone through the appeals process have been overturned.  The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company denies that its talc causes cancer, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free.  The ruling by Wolfson will allow plaintiffs to present expert testimony that J&J\u2019s talc products can cause cancer based on epidemiological studies. They will be allowed to testify that the link could be caused by contamination with asbestos and heavy metals.  Wolfson also ruled that the plaintiffs\u2019 experts cannot testify that inhaling talc can travel to the ovaries if inhaled, though they may say that it can reach the ovaries when used vaginally.  In so-called multidistrict litigations like the one before Wolfson, in which thousands of lawsuits are consolidated, a handful of cases are designated for early \u201cbellwether\u201d trials, which can help determine the strength of each side\u2019s case and aid in settlement. Testimony in such cases typically relies heavily on experts.  Several lawsuits against J&J over talc in state courts around the country have already gone to trial, including one in St. Louis, Missouri, involving 22 plaintiffs that produced a record $4.69 billion talc verdict against J&J in July 2018. The company is appealing the verdict.  In addition to the civil litigation, J&J faces a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about its talc products\u2019 safety.","282":"Johnson & Johnson on Monday said it had agreed to pay $9.9 million to resolve a lawsuit by the state of Washington accusing the company of misrepresenting key information about the risks its pelvic mesh devices posed to women.

The approval of nasal spray esketamine marks the first new type of treatment for depression in more than 30 years and has raised hopes for its relatively fast action and ability to treat some otherwise unreachable patients.  Esketamine would be sold under the brand name Spravato and is a chemical mirror image of anesthetic ketamine, which is also abused as a recreational party drug and goes by the street nickname \u201cSpecial K\u201d. To prevent abuse, patients must take the drug in a doctor\u2019s office or medical facility and cannot take it home.  Currently available anti-depressants such as Eli Lilly and Co\u2019s Prozac work on neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, but most drugs take at least four weeks to show effect and fail to produce an adequate response in about 30 percent to 40 percent of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).  \u201cSpravato has the potential to change the treatment paradigm and offer new hope to the estimated one-third of people with major depressive disorder who have not responded to existing therapies,\u201d said Mathai Mammen, global head of J&J\u2019s Janssen Research & Development.  Spravato has been touted as an asset with blockbuster potential and is expected to improve investor sentiment toward the growth prospects of J&J\u2019s pharma unit Janssen, as its top-selling rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade faces increased competition from cheaper biosimilars.  The treatment carries a boxed warning - FDA\u2019s harshest - flagging the risk for sedation and difficulty with attention, judgment and thinking, abuse and misuse, and suicidal thoughts after administration of the drug.  Spravato is absorbed by the lining of the nasal passages and into the blood stream and will be used along with a newly prescribed oral antidepressant, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement here.  During clinical trials, Spravato was found to relieve depression symptoms within 24 hours in some patients, said Janssen spokesman Greg Panico.  The approval comes after an FDA advisory panel in February voted heavily in favor of the drug esketamine, saying its benefits outweighed the risks.  However, the panel members echoed concerns raised by FDA staffers regarding the increased risk of sedation, dissociation and higher blood pressure observed in the study.  The drug is also being tested in patients with depression who are at a high risk of committing suicide.  Recent research shows that depression involves deterioration of the quality and number of nerve cell connections in areas of the brain related to mood. J&J\u2019s drug helps restore these nerve cell connections in the brain, leading to an improvement in depression symptoms, according to the company. Over 300 million people globally live with major depressive disorders, and the incidence of attempted suicide in people with this condition is about 20-fold higher than that among those without the disorder.","286":"FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  CHICAGO (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Thursday it will start adding the price of its medicines to television commercials by next month, becoming the first drugmaker to heed a call by U.S. President Donald Trump for price transparency of drugs advertised directly to consumers on TV.  The healthcare conglomerate said it will include both the list price of a product - the price before any rebates or discounts to insurers or pharmacy benefit managers - as well as potential out-of-pocket costs that patients will pay.  The move, announced in a statement on J&J\u2019s website, won swift praise from U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Last May, Azar\u2019s office released a blueprint for reducing the cost of drug prices, which included a proposal to require disclosure of list prices in TV ads for drugs.  \u201cWe commend Johnson & Johnson for recognizing the value of informing consumers about list prices and for doing so voluntarily. We call on other manufacturers to follow their lead,\u201d Azar said in a statement.  Trump made lowering the cost of prescription drugs for U.S. consumers a central issue of the 2016 presidential campaign and emphasized it again in his State of the Union Address this week.  Ads for the blood thinner Xarelto, J&J\u2019s most widely prescribed medicine, will be the first television spot to include pricing information, the company said. The treatment used to prevent blood clots costs about $450 to $540 a month.  Congress has increased its scrutiny of U.S. drug pricing since Democrats took over control of the House of Representatives in January, while pressure is also coming from the Republican-led Senate.  Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, ranking member of the committee, on Monday invited executives from seven pharmaceutical companies, including J&J, to testify at a Feb. 26 hearing on rising drug prices.","287":"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Friday it is recalling around 33,000 bottles of baby powder in the United States after U.S. health regulators found trace amounts of asbestos in samples taken from a bottle purchased online.  J&J shares fell more than 6% to close at $127.70.  The move marks the first time the company has recalled its iconic baby powder for possible asbestos contamination, and the first time U.S. regulators have announced a finding of asbestos in the product. Asbestos is a known carcinogen that has been linked to deadly mesothelioma.  The recall is the latest blow to the more than 130-year-old U.S. healthcare conglomerate that is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including baby powder, opioids, medical devices and the antipsychotic Risperdal.  A jury last week ordered the company to pay $8 billion to a plaintiff in a case claiming J&J downplayed the risks of Risperdal. That award is not expected to stand, the company and legal experts have said.  J&J faces more than 15,000 lawsuits from consumers claiming its talc products, including Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder, caused their cancer.  On a conference call with reporters on Friday, Dr. Susan Nicholson, head of Women\u2019s Health in the company\u2019s medical safety organization, called the asbestos finding \u201cextremely unusual,\u201d adding that it was \u201cinconsistent with our testing to date.\u201d  The voluntary recall announced on Friday is limited to one lot of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, the company said. J&J in a news release said that testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as recently as a month ago found no asbestos in their talc.  The FDA said in a statement that the latest sampling took place during its testing for asbestos in talc-containing cosmetics that it began reporting this year. A second Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder sample from a different lot tested negative for asbestos, the agency said.  The FDA said it stands by the quality of its testing and results and recommended consumers stop using the product if it comes from the affected lot.  J&J said on the conference call that it received a report from the FDA on Oct. 17 alerting the company about the asbestos finding. It said it has started an investigation and is reviewing manufacturing records and collecting data on the distribution of the lot to determine where the product was shipped.  J&J added that it is working with the FDA to determine the integrity of the tested sample as well as the validity of test results.  THOROUGH INVESTIGATION NEEDED  The type of asbestos discovered by FDA testing has not been found in the mine where the company sources its talc, J&J\u2019s Nicholson said. She described it as an environmental contaminant most commonly found in building materials and industrial applications.  J&J said it was too early to confirm whether cross-contamination of the sample had caused a false positive, whether the sample was taken from a bottle with an intact seal or whether the it was prepared in a controlled environment. It added that it could not confirm whether the tested product was authentic or counterfeit.  \u201cIt is so critical that we perform a thorough investigation of the sample to determine the source of contamination,\u201d Nicholson said.  Since 2003, talc in Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys Talc America, a unit of Paris-based Imerys SA and a co-defendant in much of the talc litigation. Imerys and J&J said the Chinese talc is safe.  FILE PHOTO: A bottle of Johnson & Johnson's Baby Powder is seen in a photo illustration taken in New York, February 24, 2016. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/File Photo  J&J has known for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc, Reuters reported last year. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company\u2019s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. Company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it, while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public, Reuters found.  J&J has repeatedly said that its talc products are safe, and that decades of studies have shown them to be asbestos-free and that they do not cause cancer.  The FDA test indicated the presence of no greater than 0.00002% of chrysotile asbestos in the tested sample, J&J said.  The World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later.  Thousands of the lawsuits against J&J have been consolidated before a New Jersey federal judge, who is currently weighing company motions to disqualify plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses, including the head of an asbestos testing lab who has testified in earlier trials that he found the contaminant in J&J powders.  Leigh O\u2019Dell, one of the lead plaintiff attorneys, on Friday said the recall \u201cvindicates the position we\u2019ve been taking for months.\u201d  Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said in a research note that the recall could encourage additional lawsuits and prompt the company to pursue a broader settlement.  Jefferies healthcare strategist Jared Holz said J&J has already lost close to $10 billion in market value due to the talc issue over the past year.  He said further downside to J&J stock is likely to be limited because legal concerns over talc are well known and have already taken a toll on the share price. \u201cThis is one single bottle within one lot with barely a trace here,\u201d he said.  J&J said in February that it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission for documents related to the asbestos contamination allegations. A Bloomberg report, which Reuters has confirmed, said those inquiries include a criminal grand jury investigation into how forthright J&J has been in its statements about the safety of its powders.  While talc products make up less than 1% of J&J sales expected by analysts to reach $82 billion in 2019, the New Jersey-based healthcare-products maker considers its Baby Powder to be an essential facet of a carefully tended image as a caring company.","288":"Jan 29 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said its single-dose vaccine was 72% effective in preventing COVID-19 in the United States but a lower rate of 66% was observed globally in the large trial conducted across three continents and against multiple variants.

For now, most countries are still desperate to get their hands on doses, regardless of whether or not the vaccine is considered highly effective, moderately effective will do just fine for now.\u201d  Dr Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota:  \u201cIt is a needed weapon in fighting this pandemic, especially in a world with an insufficient supply of vaccine and especially given its one-dose format and ability to remain stable for long periods of time at refrigeration temps.\u201d  \u201cAt lower efficacy, we don\u2019t yet know about the durability of protection.\u201d  Mark Siedner, infectious disease clinician at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School:  \u201cWe\u2019re preliminarily thrilled. We want these vaccines to do two things. The most important of which is stop people from getting sick and this this vaccine almost very clearly appeared to do that pretty similarly to the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a one dose regimen. It has a lower price point, it\u2019s stable in standard refrigerators and when we\u2019re talking about global epidemic control I think these are precisely the words that if you really want to hear. It\u2019s going to be welcome news for the global COVID-19 response.\u201d  Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center:  \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get to 80 plus percent of people vaccinated in order to generate the herd immunity, this vaccine would certainly help us get there.\u201d  \u201cDown the road we\u2019re, having to prepare people already. They may have to get a booster dose of a new vaccine, at some point in the future. Because it\u2019s this virus that\u2019s playing the tune we\u2019re having to dance to.\u201d  Dr. Walid Gellad, a health policy associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh:  \u201cRight now, any protection and additional vaccine is great. The \u201cSouth Africa\u201d strain is still uncommon in the U.S. and obviously we would want to see higher efficacy, but the key is not only overall efficacy but specifically efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization, and death.  It\u2019s unlikely we\u2019re going to completely eliminate Covid anytime soon, but the key is to make it a minor nuisance instead of a deadly disease.  This is one shot in the arm and good efficacy.

South Korea said on Tuesday it signed deals to provide coronavirus vaccines for 44 million people next year, including from AstraZeneca Plc, Pfizer Inc, and Moderna Inc and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Janssen.  Airlines and governments round the globe are working on ways to establish cold chain delivery systems for vaccines, like Pfizer\u2019s, which requires storage at below minus 70 Celsius, and Moderna\u2019s, which needs to be kept at -20C.  A difficulty with vaccine transport is that airplanes can only carry a limited amount of dry ice - frozen carbon dioxide - as it turns into gas over time, displacing the breathable air in the cabin.  The transport ministry raised the limit of dry ice a plane can carry from 3,300 to up to 11,000 kilogrammes, which will allow a Boeing 747 cargo plane to carry 52 containers of vaccines, up from 15, Kim Sang-do, deputy minister for civil aviation, said on the sidelines of a forum.  To allow this, it will boost safety measures such as carbon dioxide emission inspection and installation of gas meters, the ministry said in a statement.  \u201cVaccine transport is difficult due to the expertise and the steady temperature necessary,\u201d Kim said, adding that the unbroken cold chain of temperature management could include a cold cargo facility the size of two soccer fields being built near the main international airport in Incheon.

The applications to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) came a day after Moderna sought emergency use for its shot in the United States and more than a week after Pfizer and BioNTech did the same.  U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German development partner BioNTech said their vaccine could be launched in the European Union as early as this month.  \u201cWe can start to deliver within a few hours (of an approval),\u201d said Sierk Poetting, head of operations and finance at BioNTech. \u201cWe have been stocking up.

It added its schedule may be subject to change as its evaluation proceeds.  The European Commission, the EU executive body, said it would likely give its final authorization for a vaccine\u2019s rollout days after a recommendation by the EMA.  An effective immunization is seen as the main weapon against the pandemic, which has claimed more than 1.4 million lives and ravaged economies across the globe.

CUSTOMISED GENETIC CODE  Their work validates that of several biotech experts, who for years have been labouring to prove a once-unorthodox idea: The human body can act as its own vaccine factory.  Both inoculations work by injecting people with customised genetic code that instructs human cells to make key virus proteins to induce an immune response.  Pfizer and BioNTech reported final trial results on Nov. 18 that showed their vaccine candidate, known as BNT162b2, was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19, with no major safety concerns.  Moderna Inc said on Monday that full results from a late-stage study showed its candidate, mRNA-1273, was 94.1% effective, also with no serious safety concerns.  Any clearance in the EU and United States for the vaccines will be \u201cconditional\u201d or for \u201cemergency use\u201d, meaning developers are obliged to continue trials and provide more trial results as they emerge.  The European filings complete so-called rolling reviews, initiated by the EMA on Oct. 6 in the case of Pfizer and on Nov. 16 for Moderna, aimed at speeding up the process by doing a real-time assessment of the data as it lands.  The EMA said on Tuesday it had started a rolling review of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine candidate after preliminary results showed it triggered production of antibodies and immune cells against the virus. The review will go on until enough evidence ss available for a formal marketing authorisation application, the regulator added.

FILE PHOTO: A logo is pictured outside a building of the World Health Organization (WHO) during an executive board meeting on update on the coronavirus outbreak, in Geneva, Switzerland, February 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Denis Balibouse\/File Photo  COVAX, a global scheme co-led by the WHO, wants to deliver at least 2 billion COVID-19 doses across the world this year, with at least 1.3 billion going to poorer countries.  But it has so far struggled to secure enough shots due to a shortage of funds, while wealthy nations have booked large volumes of vaccines for themselves.  In the race to deploy shots, regulatory approvals are key to confirming the effectiveness and safety of vaccines, and to boosting output. But some poorer countries rely mostly on WHO authorisations as they have limited regulatory capacity.  The WHO is therefore \u201cexpediting\u201d emergency approvals, according to a COVAX internal document seen by Reuters.  The COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) could be authorised by the WHO in January or February, the document says.  The same vaccine produced in South Korea by SK Bioscience could be approved by the U.N. agency in the second half of February, at the earliest, a provisional calendar published by the WHO on Wednesday shows.  As well as vaccines, regulators usually authorise their manufacturing processes in different plants.  SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla told Reuters last week he expected WHO approval \u201cin the next week or two\u201d.  AstraZeneca did not respond to requests for comment, while SK said it was not aware of the WHO\u2019s approval timeline.  The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Oxford University, has already been given emergency approval in Britain, while decisions in the European Union and the United States are close.  COVAX has supply contracts with AstraZeneca and SII for about 400 million doses and an option for many more hundreds of millions, although the timing of deliveries is uncertain.  OTHER WESTERN SHOTS  The WHO authorised the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech at the end of December.  WHO officials have said they are seeking a supply deal with the U.S. pharmaceutical giant, which has already committed hundreds of millions of doses this year to several wealthy nations.  COVAX had not initially included the Pfizer\/BioNTech shot in its shortlist for advance purchases.  Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment on whether a deal was close and whether it would involve only a limited number of doses this year.  The provisional approval calendar also shows the WHO is expected to approve Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, which is based on the same messenger RNA (mRNA) technology as Pfizer\u2019s, at the end of February.  Moderna, whose vaccine is already approved in many Western countries including in the United States and the European Union, had no immediate comment.  The vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson (J&J), which has a non-binding agreement to supply COVAX with 500 million doses over an unspecified timeframe, is expected to get WHO approval in May or June at the earliest, the WHO document says.  J&J has not yet published results of its vaccine\u2019s Phase III clinical trials, but the EU has said it expects the company to apply for approval as early as February.  A J&J spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.  CHINA AND RUSSIA  The WHO is also considering possible quick approvals for two Chinese vaccines, the provisional calendar shows.  Sinopharm and Sinovac have filed their applications with the WHO, which is reviewing them and could make decisions on both in March at the earliest, it says.  Neither vaccine was shortlisted by the WHO for possible advance purchase deals. WHO approval does not automatically lead to purchases by COVAX. It could also facilitate the rollout in poorer countries that acquire the vaccines directly.  Sinopharm has filed applications for two COVID-19 vaccines, but the possible March approval concerns only the one developed by its Beijing-based affiliate, Beijing Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd (BIBP), which has already been widely used for inoculations in China.  Sinovac has yet to release global results of its Phase III trials, but its vaccine has been approved for emergency use in countries including Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey.  Sinopharm and Sinovac did not respond to requests for comment.  There is no provisional timetable yet for the possible approval of Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine, despite its developers having filed the relevant documentation, the timetable shows.  The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the main financial backer of Sputnik V, did not respond to a request for comment.","305":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and its talc suppliers on Wednesday were hit with a $21.7 million jury verdict in a lawsuit by a woman who said she developed cancer after being exposed to asbestos in the company's Baby Powder.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The verdict by a Los Angeles jury came down in the case of 68-year-old Joanne Anderson, who was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a form of cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure, and marked the second trial loss for J&J over similar allegations.  Of the $21.7 million the jury awarded in compensatory damages, J&J was assigned 67 percent, with the rest distributed among other defendants.  J&J has vehemently denied that its talc products contain asbestos or cause cancer, citing decades of testing by independent laboratories and scientists. But plaintiffs claim that asbestos and talc, which are closely linked minerals, are intermingled in the mining process, making it impossible to remove the carcinogenic substance.  Anderson and her husband in 2017 had sued J&J, a unit of Imerys SA IMTP.PA, Cyprus Amax Minerals, a unit of Brenntag BNRGn.DE, Honeywell International HON.N and other local talc suppliers, but it was not immediately clear which of those companies were subject to the remaining damages award.  Damages could still grow as the jury debates whether to award punitive damages, Anderson\u2019s lawyer, Chris Panatier, said, declining to comment further.  \u201cWhile we are disappointed with this decision, the jury has further deliberations to conduct in this trial and we will reserve additional comment until the case is fully completed,\u201d J&J said in a statement.  J&J has also been battling some 6,000 cases claiming its baby powder caused ovarian cancer, but the talc litigation has taken a new focus in recent months with plaintiffs claiming the widely used product causes mesothelioma due to alleged asbestos contamination.  Wednesday\u2019s verdict marks the second trial loss for J&J over allegations that its talc-based products contain asbestos.  A New Jersey state court jury in April ordered J&J and its talc supplier, a unit of Imerys SA IMTP.PA, to pay $117 million to a man who alleged he developed mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure from J&J Baby Powder. An appeal is pending.  A California jury in November last year cleared J&J of liability in another mesothelioma lawsuit.

They filed their brief late Wednesday.  The request could amount to $3.3 billion, based on a $48 billion settlement proposal that five companies have been negotiating with various state attorneys general.  The drug companies noted that the attorneys would receive more money from the settlement than even some of the states they represent. Dozens of state attorneys general also opposed the request for the fee to the plaintiffs executive committee that is litigating thousands of lawsuits by towns, counties and tribal governments.  The lawsuits, consolidated before Polster, accuse the companies of fueling a nationwide opioid crisis blamed for 400,000 U.S. overdose deaths since 1999.  Many local governments hired private attorneys and will have to carve out of any money received for a separate legal fee, which in some cases will be paid to the same attorneys who sit on the plaintiffs executive committee, or PEC.  \u201cThe scope of that demand is staggering,\u201d the companies said in Wednesday\u2019s joint filing.

In court filings, PEC lawyers described the fee request as \u201cmodest\u201d given the complex litigation. Such a fee, to compensate for lawyers\u2019 time and expenses, is a feature of complex nationwide litigation.  The fee request has also met opposition from state attorneys general, who brought their own opioid cases that are not before Polster.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Risperdal in 1993 to treat schizophrenia and bipolar mania in adults, and in 2006 for irritability associated with autism in children.  Plaintiffs suing over the drug have said Johnson & Johnson concealed the link between Risperdal and excessive growth of female breast tissue in boys, known as gynecomastia.  While doctors may prescribe many drugs as they see fit, including for off-label uses, Murray said Johnson & Johnson should have warned his doctors about Risperdal\u2019s side effects.  Johnson & Johnson said in October it faced lawsuits by 13,600 people over Risperdal.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  After less than a day of deliberations, the jury in New Brunswick, New Jersey rejected claims by Rosalind Henry and her husband, who had alleged that Henry\u2019s mesothelioma, a cancer associated with asbestos exposure, was caused by the company\u2019s talc products.  J&J is facing some 10,600 liability lawsuits across the United States over its talc products, most involving claims that they caused ovarian cancer, and that the company knew of and concealed risks associated with the products.  The company, which is based just a few miles from the courtroom where the latest case took place, said it was pleased with the unanimous jury verdict.  \u201cWe have deep sympathy for anyone diagnosed with any form of cancer and appreciate that people are looking for answers. However, Johnson\u2019s baby powder is not the cause of this disease,\u201d the company said in a statement. It said decades of scientific testing by academic institutions and regulators have shown its talc to be safe and free of asbestos.  A lawyer for Henry did not immediately return a request for comment. During trial, Henry\u2019s lawyers said J&J had known for decades about asbestos fibers in its talc, but hid the evidence from regulators and consumers.  J&J has been fighting talc cancer lawsuits for several years, but the litigation shifted in recent months to include allegations of asbestos contamination.  Plaintiffs now claim asbestos fibers in the products are causing both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.  In April, J&J lost the first trial over such allegations when a jury in New Jersey awarded $117 million to a man suffering from mesothelioma and his wife.  It lost another trial in May, when a California jury awarded $25.7 million to a woman diagnosed with mesothelioma. Both decisions are under appeal.  Since then, the company has had four mistrials in similar cases because jurors could not reach a verdict or because the plaintiff died.  In July, a Missouri jury hit J&J with a massive $4.69 billion verdict in the first trial alleging asbestos contamination has caused ovarian cancer in 22 women.

The list price of the drug, known chemically as erdafitinib, will range between $10,080 to $22,680 for a 28-day supply, depending of the dose, J&J said.  Balversa is the first approved drug in a class known as FGFR inhibitors that targets growth factor receptors involved in cell growth and division.  The drug is approved for use in patients whose cancer has progressed during or after chemotherapy and have specific genetic alterations known as FGFR3 or FGFR2. Patients will be selected for therapy with Balversa using an FDA-approved companion diagnostic device that will identify the genetic mutations, the agency said.  Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, with the FGFR alterations present in about one in five patients.  \u201cWe\u2019re in an era of more personalized or precision medicine, and the ability to target cancer treatment to a patient\u2019s specific genetic mutation or biomarker is becoming the standard,\u201d Richard Pazdur, head of the FDA\u2019s oncology products division, said in a statement.

The approval was based on a small 87-patient trial in which about a third of subjects experienced tumor shrinkage. The median duration before disease progression was 5.4 months.  Common side effects of the drug include high phosphate levels, mouth sores and fatigue. The drug may cause serious eye problems, including inflamed eyes, the FDA said.","317":"BOSTON (Reuters) - A Johnson & Johnson unit will pay the U.S. government $360 million to resolve an investigation into its financial support of a charity that helped Medicare patients cover out-of-pocket drug costs, the Justice Department said on Thursday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The settlement with Actelion Pharmaceuticals US Inc, which became a subsidiary of J&J following a 2017 acquisition, was the largest so far to result from an industry-wide probe into drugmakers\u2019 support of patient assistance charities.  The government said Actelion from 2014 to 2015 used a charity as a conduit to improperly pay the co-pay obligations of thousands of Medicare patients using its pulmonary artery hypertension treatments Tracleer, Ventavis, Veletri and Opsumit.  That charity, Caring Voice Coalition (CVC), has stopped providing aid after the government in 2017 revoked its approval to do so because of concerns drugmakers had improper influence over it.  Actelion did not admit wrongdoing. Caroline Pavis, a company spokeswoman, in a statement said the conduct pre-dated New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J\u2019s acquisition of Actelion and that it was committed to following the law.  Richmond, Virginia-based CVC said it cannot comment on \u201congoing legal matters.\u201d  Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in the Medicare government healthcare program for the elderly. But companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent.  Amid increased attention on rising drug prices in the United States, there has been concern that donations from drugmakers to patient-assistance groups may be contributing to price inflation.  A probe led by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts has led to allegations that several drugmakers used these charitable foundations as a means to pay Medicare patients\u2019 co-pays in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.  In Actelion\u2019s case, the government said it routinely obtained data from CVC regarding the extent that patients it helped used its drugs. Actelion then used that information to budget for future payments to the charity.  CVC was at the center of an earlier, $210 million settlement by United Therapeutics Corp in December 2017, which resolved claims the company improperly used the charity to cover co-payments.  Several other drugmakers have, since 2015, disclosed receiving subpoenas related to the investigation. Pfizer Inc in May resolved similar allegations involving a different charity for nearly $23.85 million.  Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc and Lundbeck earlier this year disclosed they had reached agreements to resolve similar claims for $57 million and $52.6 million, respectively.","318":"A federal judge has ruled that a $35 million jury award to an Indiana woman who said she suffered injuries due to a pelvic mesh device manufactured by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Ethicon unit must be reduced by $15 million.

Last week, Johnson & Johnson said it asked U.S. health regulators to authorize its single-dose COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, and added it will apply to European authorities in the coming weeks.  The drugmaker\u2019s application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) followed its Jan. 29 report in which it said the vaccine had a 66% overall efficacy at preventing moderate-to-severe disease.  Earlier on Tuesday, South Africa\u2019s joint lead investigator for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial said that a government regulator was processing an application for the vaccine to be granted emergency use authorisation.

FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a \"Coronavirus COVID-19 Vaccine\" sticker and a medical syringe in front of the displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken, October 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  The laboratory study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is another worry for the country hardest-hit by the pandemic on the African continent after it placed AstraZeneca vaccinations on hold earlier this month.  Although its implications on the real-world efficacy of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine are not yet clear, the study comes after clinical trial data on the AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Novavax vaccines showed reduced efficacy against the more contagious 501Y.V2 variant, first identified late last year.  South Africa has been counting on the Pfizer shot, developed with German partner BioNTech, to step up its vaccination programme after administering the first J&J doses on Wednesday.  It is considering swapping or selling its AstraZeneca doses, after a small local trial, where participants were on average 31 years old, showed the vaccine offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness caused by the 501Y.V2 variant.  Officials are more confident about the J&J shot because it was shown to be effective against severe illness in the local leg of a large global trial.  The study published on Wednesday took into account all key mutations of the 501Y.V2 variant. A paper published in late January assessed the impact of only three key mutations of the variant.  Scientists say that because the new study\u2019s findings come from a laboratory, it is not easy to extrapolate what they might mean in the real world.  Peter English, a consultant in communicable disease control, said it was \u201cfar from proven\u201d that the Pfizer vaccine would be less effective against the 501Y.V2 variant. He said cellular immunity - as well as antibodies - was important in protecting against the virus and that scientists did not know the level of neutralising antibodies needed for immunity.  \u201cOur scientists will be meeting to discuss it (the study) and they will advise the minister,\u201d health ministry spokesman Popo Maja said.  Barry Schoub, chair of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on vaccines, said the committee would discuss the study alongside information on other vaccines.  Asked to comment on the findings, he said: \u201cThe Pfizer vaccine is enormously effective at 95%, so even if there is quite a significant reduction there still will be quite a bit of remnant efficacy left.  \u201cIt is very likely that it will protect to a reasonable extent, certainly against severe illness and mild to moderate to some extent,\u201d he said.  \u201cSTRONG ENOUGH\u201d  Richard Mihigo, an immunisation official at the World Health Organization\u2019s Africa office, told a news conference the antibody response to the variant in the Pfizer study was \u201cstrong enough\u201d.  Linda-Gail Bekker, co-lead investigator of the South African arm of J&J\u2019s global trial, said she would recommend rolling out the Pfizer vaccine but monitoring it in the same way as the J&J shot, which is being administered in an \u201cimplementation study\u201d targeting up to 500,000 health workers to further test it.  Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Wednesday South Africa was expecting 500,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine initially and about 7 million doses by June.  A spokesman for regulator SAHPRA said Pfizer\u2019s registration application was under review and declined further comment.  South Africa, with nearly 1.5 million cases and about 48,500 deaths, has recorded almost half the COVID-19 fatalities and over a third of confirmed infections in Africa. It lagged richer Western nations in launching its immunisation campaign.

The Johnson & Johnson logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The acceleration should allow J&J to take part in the massive clinical trials program planned by the U.S. government, which aims to have an effective vaccine by year end.  J&J shares rose nearly 2% to $148.69.  Last March, J&J signed deals with the U.S. government to create enough manufacturing capacity to produce more than 1 billion doses of its vaccine through 2021, even before it has evidence that it works.  There are currently no U.S. approved treatments or vaccines for the virus. A vaccine is seen as essential to ending the pandemic that has infected more than 7.2 million people and killed over 412,000 globally, while battering economies worldwide.  J&J initially expected safety trials to start in September. Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels told Reuters the company has been working closely with its U.S. government partners to accelerate that timeline.  \u201cBased on the strength of the preclinical data we have seen so far and interactions with the regulatory authorities, we have been able to further accelerate the clinical development,\u201d Stoffels said in a statement on Wednesday.  J&J\u2019s study will test the vaccine for safety and early signs of efficacy in 1,045 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years, and in those aged 65 and older. The trial will take place in the United States and Belgium.  The company is also in talks with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(NIAID) to start larger, late-stage trials ahead of schedule, depending on results of the early studies and regulatory approval.  The United States is planning to test a handful of coronavirus vaccine candidates in trials that will enroll up to 30,000 subjects with the aim of getting an answer on efficacy as quickly as possible. National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told Reuters that companies will need to complete their safety trials by the end of summer to be included in those studies.  Stoffels said last week that J&J hopes to have results of its vaccine efficacy trials in the first quarter of 2021. He added that the company is \u201cworking hard to bring it back to the end of the year.\u201d  A lot will depend on how much virus is circulating at that time, he said.  \u201cIf you have an incidence of 1% a year versus 4% a year, it\u2019s totally different. And that\u2019s where these trials are so unpredictable,\u201d he said referring to the percentage of new cases occurring in the population at the time.  The company plans to test the vaccine in high-transmission regions within the United States. If the incidence is low, \u201cwe will complement that with international sites to make sure that we reach enough endpoints quickly to prove the vaccine works,\u201d Stoffels said.  Moderna Inc, which is working in close partnership with NIAID, has started testing its vaccine candidate in a 600-subject mid-stage trial. The company expects to begin late-stage trials in July.  Moderna\u2019s vaccine uses messenger RNA technology, an approach that has yet to produce any approved vaccines. J&J is utilizing the same technology used to make its Ebola vaccine, which won European regulatory approval late last month.  There are about 10 coronavirus vaccines in human testing. Experts have said a safe and effective vaccine could take at least 12 to 18 months from the start of development, which would shave several years off the typical vaccine development timeline.

Erleada is expected to compete with Pfizer\u2019s Xtandi, which is also a rival to Zytiga.  Earlier this month, data from a study testing Xtandi showed that use of the drug in early stage prostate cancer on top of standard hormone therapy reduced the risk of the disease spreading or death by 71 percent compared with hormone therapy alone.

J&J shares fell more than 2% following news of the pause and safety review. Rival AstraZeneca Plc's AZN.L U.S. trial for its coronavirus vaccine candidate - which uses a similar technology - has remained on hold for more than a month after a participant in the company's UK trial fell ill.  J&J, whose vaccine effort is among the high profile attempts to fight the coronavirus pandemic, said on Monday the illness was being reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring board as well as by its own clinical and safety team.  The data board, which is also reviewing AstraZeneca\u2019s U.S. trial, is required to submit its findings to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration before the study can be restarted.  Mathai Mammen, head of research & development at J&J\u2019s drugs business, said the company informed the safety board about the ill trial participant on Sunday. The board has asked for more information, he said, adding that the company is collecting information to answer its questions.  \u201cIt will be a few days at minimum for the right set of information to be gathered and evaluated,\u201d Mammen said during a conference call to discuss the company\u2019s quarterly results.  He said because the study is blinded, the company did not yet know if the ill person had been given the vaccine or a placebo. Mammen added that J&J remains on track to complete recruitment for its 60,000-person trial in the next two to three months.  EVIDENCE OF \u2018INTEGRITY\u2019  The company said such pauses are not unusual in large trials.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  It noted that the voluntary \u201cstudy pause\u201d in giving doses of the vaccine candidate to trial participants was different from a \u201cregulatory hold\u201d imposed by health authorities.  J&J has said it expects to have enough data to apply for U.S. regulatory clearance by the end of the year. Pfizer Inc PFE.N and Moderna Inc MRNA.O have said they expect to be able to apply for FDA clearance for their vaccine candidates even sooner.  Former FDA chief Scott Gottlieb said on Twitter that the oversight of safety boards for COVID-19 vaccine trials is evidence of the \u201cintegrity, rigor, and careful nature\u201d of the vaccine trial process.  Health experts have voiced concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump could put pressure on the FDA and drugmakers to rush an unsafe vaccine to market to bolster his re-election prospect. He has repeatedly said a vaccine could be available prior to the Nov. 3 election.  AstraZeneca last month paused late-stage trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine developed with the University of Oxford due to a serious unexplained illness in a British study participant. While AstraZeneca\u2019s trials in Britain, Brazil, South Africa and India have since resumed, its U.S. trial remains on hold.  The J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines both use modified, harmless - although different - versions of adenoviruses to deliver genetic instructions to human cells in order to spur an immune response to the target virus, in this case the novel coronavirus.  They are both also part of the U.S. government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed program to support vaccine development. J&J on Sept. 22 became the fourth Warp Speed participant to enter the final stage of human vaccine testing.  \u201cThis could be a second case of adenoviral vaccine to spur safety concerns,\u201d said Bryan Garnier analyst Olga Smolentseva.  The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines employ an entirely different technology.  AstraZeneca and medical experts say trial suspensions to look into the cause of a participant\u2019s illness are not uncommon.  \u201cEverybody is on the alert because of what happened with AstraZeneca,\u201d Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said by email, adding it could take a week to gather information.  \u201cThis is likely to be a neurological event,\u201d he said. Last month, J&J said its vaccine candidate produced a strong immune response in an earlier stage clinical trial. Results from the paused pivotal trial had been expected by the end of this year or early 2021.  Stat News reported here the pause on Monday, citing a document sent to outside researchers. The document said a \"pausing rule\" had been met, the online system used to enroll patients in the study had been closed and the data and safety monitoring board would be convened.","344":"April 30 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson:  * ACTELION SUBMITS SUPPLEMENTAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION TO U.S. FDA SEEKING APPROVAL OF OPSUMIT\u00ae (MACITENTAN) FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC THROMBOEMBOLIC PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (CTEPH)  * ACTELION PHARMACEUTICALS SAYS SUBMITS SUPPLEMENTAL NDA TO FDA FOR APPROVAL OF OPSUMIT (MACITENTAN) FOR TREATING CHRONIC THROMBOEMBOLIC PULMONARY HYPERTENSION Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","345":"April 11 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson:  * ANNOUNCED ACUVUE OASYS WITH TRANSITIONS LIGHT INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY CONTACT LENS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","346":"FILE PHOTO: Vials with a sticker reading, \"COVID-19 \/ Coronavirus vaccine \/ Injection only\" and a medical syringe are seen in front of a displayed Johnson & Johnson logo in this illustration taken October 31, 2020.

J&J\u2019s study, named Ensemble, is being conducted by its unit Janssen, the drugmaker said in a statement.

The company had earlier this month announced cuts in enrollment for the vaccine trial from its original plan for 60,000, as higher rates of COVID-19 infections amid a worsening pandemic should generate the data it needs with fewer study subjects.  The Ensemble trial was paused for over a week in October after a patient developed an \u201cunexplained illness\u201d during the study.

In a hearing announcement, the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy said that its efforts to persuade Gorsky to testify included \u201crepeated attempts to accommodate the company\u201d over nearly a month.  But J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said that the subcommittee rejected the company\u2019s offers to send a talc testing expert or a J&J executive in charge of consumer products. The panel will hear from experts on the health ramifications of talc powders and cosmetics, and on methods for detecting cancer-causing asbestos in such products.  Gorsky \u201cis not, as we have repeatedly told the Subcommittee, an expert in the stated subject of the hearing,\u201d Knewitz said.  \u201cWe have respectfully declined the invitation for our CEO to testify,\u201d Knewitz said.  Gorsky has played a lead role in J&J\u2019s efforts to reassure consumers and investors that its talc powders are safe and asbestos free. It was Gorsky who issued a statement vouching for the safety of the products last year after a jury issued a $4.69 billion verdict for 22 women who sued over allegations their ovarian cancers were caused by J&J powders.  Gorsky appeared on CNBC\u2019s \"Mad Money with Jim Cramer\" and in a video posted on J&J\u2019s website to rebut a December 2018 Reuters report here that the company knew for decades about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its talc and powders.  \u201cSince tests for asbestos in talc were first developed, J&J\u2019s Baby Powder has never contained asbestos,\u201d Gorsky said in the video.  In October, Gorsky testified in a deposition here in a lawsuit filed by an Indiana man, saying, \"We unequivocally believe that our talc and our baby powder does not contain asbestos.\" J&J faces more than 16,000 similar lawsuits.  Concerns over asbestos in talc cosmetics have grown in recent months as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that the carcinogen had been found in several products, including a bottle of Baby Powder.  J&J said it recalled 33,000 bottles of Baby Powder \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d Later, J&J said labs it hired found no asbestos - other than some contamination it blamed on an air conditioner - in samples from the same Baby Powder bottle and its production lot.  The FDA has said it stands by its finding.  Chief executives of companies embroiled in controversies routinely comply with lawmakers\u2019 invitations to testify.  In recent months, the chief executives of Boeing and Facebook have appeared before congressional committees to answer questions about how their companies were safeguarding consumers.  Charles M.

The country, which has recorded the most coronavirus infections in Africa and more than 46,000 deaths, had planned to start offering healthcare workers the AstraZeneca jabs soon but put that plan on hold on Sunday.  A government factsheet published on Monday said the J&J vaccine would be offered from mid-February. A senior health official said J&J had agreed to speed up deliveries so the first doses would become available around the end of the week.  \u201cOur vaccine rollout plan has not changed, except that we will begin with the Johnson & Johnson instead of the AstraZeneca vaccine,\u201d the factsheet said.  J&J said it was in advanced discussions with South Africa about \u201cpotential additional collaborations\u201d to combat COVID-19. \u201cWe hope to be able to share more details in the coming days,\u201d it said.  Preliminary trial data showing the AstraZeneca shot does not significantly reduce the risk of mild-to-moderate illness caused by the more contagious 501Y.V2 variant first identified late last year was a disappointment not just to South Africa, but to the continent as a whole.  The 501Y.V2 variant is believed to have spread to nine other African countries, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiological report last week.  The AstraZeneca vaccine is seen as one of the best suited to weak African health systems as it can be stored at refrigerator temperatures, rather than the ultra-cold temperatures needed for shots from Pfizer\/BioNTech .  Global vaccine distribution scheme COVAX plans to start sending millions of AstraZeneca doses to African countries this month.  GLOBAL ROLE  The trial by researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg did not assess whether the AstraZeneca vaccine protected against severe COVID-19.  Shabir Madhi, the trial\u2019s lead investigator, told Reuters the AstraZeneca vaccine still had a major role to play in Africa and globally, and that it probably protected against severe cases.  The government is holding talks with scientists on how to proceed.  Malawi\u2019s information minister said the country would move ahead with the vaccine when it becomes available, unless the 501Y.V2 variant became dominant there.  A Ugandan health ministry spokesman said the government would seek guidance from the WHO, and a Nigerian health official said the country would stick to plans to use the AstraZeneca shot.  Professor Salim Abdool Karim, an adviser to the South Africa government, said the AstraZeneca vaccine would in future be rolled out in a \u201cstepped manner\u201d to assess its ability to prevent severe illness.  AstraZeneca, which developed the vaccine with Oxford University, says it has already started adapting it against the 501Y.V2 variant.  South African health ministry Deputy Director-General Anban Pillay told state broadcaster SABC that the J&J vaccine was a good fit.

J&J is in the final phase of its clinical trials and is likely to announce results by the end of January, Nicolaou added.  The South African health ministry said late Thursday that negotiations on sourcing a vaccine are at an advanced stage with J&J. It said it will announce the developments soon.  Johnson & Johnson, in an emailed reply to Reuters, said it is committed to \u201ccontinuing engagement with the South African government\u201d on the vaccine. But did not give details on the status of the negotiations.  The government has been criticised by scientists and healthcare workers for moving too slowly to procure COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate South Africans.  Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Thursday that South Africa plans to get its first vaccines in February and could vaccinate up to 40 million people over a year to reach herd immunity.  But the government has not signed any big bilateral deals with any of the vaccine manufacturers, although it said the country would get 1.5 million vaccines from the Serum Institute of India (SII).  The government is also sourcing vaccines from the COVAX Facility, a global distribution scheme under which South Africa will start getting vaccines by the second quarter of 2021 for 10% of its population of 58 million.  Nicolaou said he was not privy to the status of the negotiations, but the government had requested that Aspen \u201cimpress upon\u201d J&J to set aside some vaccines.

Shares of the healthcare conglomerate fell nearly 2% to $146.62 after it reported a rare miss on quarterly revenue, as sales of cancer drug Imbruvica and psoriasis treatment Stelara came in below lofty Wall Street estimates.  J&J\u2019s pharmaceuticals unit, which makes up half of the company\u2019s overall sales, has powered much of its recent growth.  However, generic competition for medicines such as prostate cancer drug Zytiga, coupled with pressure to hold down prescription drug price increases in the United States, has weighed on revenue.  Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said the company still expects sales growth to accelerate in 2020, but it will \u201cprobably not be as robust as we would have thought this time last year.\u201d  He said J&J did not take as big a hit from generic and biosimilar competition in 2019 as feared, and that the company hoped its off-patent branded products could maintain market share into 2020.  J&J expects full-year 2020 adjusted earnings of $8.95 to $9.10 per share, with a midpoint below current analysts\u2019 average estimates at the top of the range.  Important newer drugs posted double-digit sales gains in the fourth quarter but missed analysts\u2019 forecasts.  Stelara rose 17.7% to $1.70 billion, short of Credit Suisse\u2019s estimate of $1.79 billion, while Imbruvica sales jumped 24.5% to $875 million, but still came up short of the brokerage\u2019s estimate of $907 million.  Pharmaceutical sales rose 3.5% to $10.55 billion in the fourth quarter, but failed to reach Wall Street estimates of $10.63 billion, according Refinitiv data.  Overall sales rose 1.7% to $20.75 billion, below the average analyst estimate of $20.80 billion, marking the company\u2019s first revenue miss in at least eight quarters.  The company said it will not actively participate in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration hearing early next month to discuss testing methods for talc.  \u201cWe certainly welcome any discussion around the safety and efficacy of the product... I can say that our current internal testing methods exceed that of current FDA standards for cosmetic talc,\u201d Wolk said.

In the trial of nearly 44,000 volunteers, the level of protection against moderate and severe COVID-19 varied from 72% in the United States, to 66% in Latin America and just 57% in South Africa, from where a worrying variant has spread.  The data showed that the vaccine\u2019s effect on the South Africa variant was diminished compared to the unaltered virus, but infectious disease and public health experts said it can still help contain the virus spread and prevent deaths.  Midstage trial data from Novavax on Thursday also documented lower effectiveness in South Africa.  Rival shots from Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna were both around 95% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in pivotal trials when given in two doses.  Those trials were conducted mainly in the United States and before the emergence of new variants. These mean that the world is racing against time and with limited supplies to vaccinate as many people as possible, and quickly, to prevent virus surges.  COVID-19 is rising in 37 countries and infections have surpassed 101 million globally.  Top U.S. infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci said the world needs to vaccinate quickly to try to get ahead of these changes in the virus.  \u201cIt\u2019s really a wake up call for us to be nimble and to be able to adjust as this virus will continue for certain to evolve,\u201d Fauci said.  J&J\u2019s main goal was the prevention of moderate to severe COVID-19, and the vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization across all geographies and against multiple variants 28 days after immunization.  That \u201cwill potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of COVID-19,\u201d Paul Stoffels, J&J\u2019s chief scientific officer, said.  SEEKING APPROVAL  J&J plans to seek emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration next week and will soon follow up with the European Union and the rest of the world.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  It has said it plans to deliver 1 billion doses of the vaccine, which it will make in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India, in 2021.  Public health officials are counting on it to increase much-needed supply and simplify immunization in the United States, which has a deal to buy 100 million doses of J&J\u2019s vaccine and an option for an additional 200 million.  J&J said the vaccine would be ready immediately upon emergency approval, but Stoffels declined to say how many doses.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  \u201cThe key is not only overall efficacy but specifically efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization, and death,\u201d said Walid Gellad, a health policy associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh.  J&J\u2019s vaccine uses a common cold virus to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells and trigger an immune response, whereas the Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines employ a new technology called messenger RNA.  Unlike these vaccines, J&J\u2019s does not require a second shot weeks after the first or need to be kept frozen, making it a strong candidate for use in parts of the world where transportation and cold storage present problems.  \u201cMost countries are still desperate to get their hands on doses, regardless of whether or not the vaccine is considered highly effective. Moderately effective will do just fine for now,\u201d Michael Breen, Director of Infectious Diseases and Ophthalmology at research firm GlobalData, said.  \u2018OVERWHELMED\u2019  Several studies have emerged this month showing that a South African variant has mutated in areas of the virus that are key targets of vaccines, reducing their efficacy.  \u201cWhat we are learning is there is different efficacy in different parts of the world,\u201d Stoffels told Reuters.  In a sub-study of 6,000 volunteers in South Africa, Stoffels said, the J&J vaccine was 89% effective at preventing severe disease. In the South Africa portion of the trial, 95% of cases were infections with the South African variant.  \u201cI am overwhelmed by the fact that this vaccine protected against severe disease even in South Africa,\u201d said Glenda Gray, the joint lead investigator of the South African vaccine trial.  In the J&J trial, which was conducted in eight countries, 44% of participants were from the United States, 41% from Central and South America and 15% from South Africa. Just over a third of the volunteers were over 60.","361":"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N on Tuesday said it expects its medical device business to begin recovering in the fourth quarter as elective medical procedures delayed by the coronavirus pandemic start to resume.  The U.S. healthcare conglomerate lowered its full-year 2020 forecast due to the hit to that business, with procedures like hip and knee replacements on hold. The division accounts for nearly 30% of total sales.  However, investors appeared to take heart that J&J did not simply withdraw its 2020 forecasts over coronavirus uncertainty as the pandemic causes massive business disruptions around the world. It also raised the quarterly dividend to $1.01 per share, and its shares rose 4.4% to $145.87.  J&J\u2019s 2020 adjusted earnings forecast of $7.50 to $7.90 per share - down from its prior view of $8.95 to $9.10 - assumes any return of the coronavirus outbreak in the fall will look much different than the current global health crisis.  \u201cIf the virus does return, the world should be much better prepared to test, identify and isolate it. There may also be therapeutic options available,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said on a conference call.  Wolk said he expected elective procedures and doctor visits to largely resume in the second half of the year, with the business seeing a lingering impact but starting to stabilize in the third quarter.  Drugmakers and medical researchers are racing to develop treatments and vaccines for the novel coronavirus, which has infected some 2 million people globally and killed over 123,000.  J&J plans to start human trials of its vaccine candidate by September. It signed a vaccine deal with the U.S. government to jointly invest $1 billion and hopes to be able to manufacture more than 1 billion doses.  J&J said it is developing the vaccine on a \u201cnot-for-profit\u201d basis.  \u201cBeing part of the solution to conquer the pandemic is good for all businesses, not just the business of Johnson & Johnson,\u201d Wolk told Reuters in a phone interview.  The company was not looking to recoup research and development costs and plans to price the vaccine to offset costs related to its manufacturing and distribution, Wolk said.  J&J, the first major U.S. drugmaker to report earnings since the outbreak, said medical device sales in the first quarter fell 8.2% to $5.93 billion, with products used in high-margin orthopedic procedures and vision correction hit particularly hard.

Johnson & Johnson fell 3.56% as one of the biggest weights on both the Dow and S&P500 after the drugmaker said its single-dose vaccine was 72% effective in preventing COVID-19 in the United States, with a lower rate of 66% observed globally.  The results compare to the high bar set by two authorized vaccines from Pfizer Inc\/BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc, which were around 95% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in key trials when given in two doses. Moderna shares climbed 8.53% while Pfizer shares edged up 0.11%.  Worries of a short squeeze that began earlier in the week resurfaced after an army of retail investors returned to trade shares in stocks such as GameStop Corp and Koss Corp, which shot higher after brokers including Robinhood eased some of the restrictions they had placed on trading.  \u201cThe overall picture is that if there is any bad news that suggests or indicates there could be a longer hibernation period for us to be indoors and not consuming or spending that tends to set the market back and a lot of people sit on the sidelines, particularly with that news,\u201d said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs in New York.  \u201cAnd then what is going on with (Gamestop) and all that stuff, people are a little afraid to trade.\u201d  The surge in volatility has led to a huge increase in volume, totaling over 20 billion shares in each of the past two sessions across U.S. exchanges for the most active trading days on record going back to 2014, according to Refinitiv data.

All three main indexes suffered their biggest weekly fall since the end of October, as the Dow lost 3.28%, the S&P fell 3.31% and the Nasdaq declined 3.49%. For the month, the Dow dipped 2.04%, the S&P shed 1.12% and the Nasdaq gained 1.42%.  Both the S&P and Dow closed below their 50-day moving average, seen as a technical support level.  Market participants have speculated that volatility caused by the short squeezes have led to investor favorites including Apple Inc coming under pressure as hedge funds sell to cover billions of dollars in losses.  Apple shares declined 3.74% while Microsoft fell 2.92%.  Still, while concerns about rising COVID-19 cases and bumpy vaccine rollouts kept investors leery about a pullback and an increase in volatility in the near-term, the start to quarterly earnings has eased some concern about stretched stock valuations.  Of the 184 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings through Friday morning, 84.2% have topped analyst expectations, well above the 75.5% beat rate for the past four quarters, according to Refinitiv data.  Honeywell International lost 3.68% after it posted a 13% fall in quarterly profit.  The first known U.S. cases of the South African COVID-19 variant, found to be partly resistant to current vaccines and antibody treatments, was detected in South Carolina on Thursday.  Data showed U.S. labor costs rose more than expected in the fourth quarter amid a jump in wages, supporting views that inflation could accelerate this year, while another report showed U.S. consumer spending fell for a second straight month in December.

J&J, which is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, said last week it was recalling around 33,000 bottles of baby powder in the United States after U.S. health regulators found trace amounts of asbestos, a known carcinogen, in samples taken from a bottle purchased online.  The move marked the first time J&J recalled its iconic baby powder for possible asbestos contamination, and the first time U.S. regulators announced a finding of asbestos in the product.  Last week\u2019s recall was the latest blow to the more than 130-year-old U.S. healthcare conglomerate that is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including baby powder, opioids, medical devices and the antipsychotic Risperdal.  Target has removed all bottles of the product from its stores and Target.com following the recall, a spokeswoman said in an email on Friday.  CVS Health Corp said on Thursday it would remove the bottles from its online store as well, out of caution and to prevent customer confusion. The pharmacy chain said all other sizes of the talc would remain on its shelves.  \u201cIt\u2019s not important at all in terms of the dollar figure to either CVS or J&J. What it tells you is that retailers are being extra cautious with how they are dealing with J&J\u2019s voluntary recall,\u201d Jefferies healthcare analyst Jared Holz said.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/File Photo  All product returned to J&J through the recall process \u2013 whether the product is from the impacted lot or not \u2013 is removed from the marketplace permanently, the company said.  Rite Aid had informed its stores to pull all 22-ounce bottles of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder from shelves on Oct. 18 and store them in a secure location, company spokesman Chris Savarese said.  \u201cAdditionally, we\u2019ve applied a point of sale system block for this product to prevent it from being sold.\u201d  Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, has also removed and blocked all potentially impacted baby powder, a company spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.  J&J\u2019s voluntary recall was limited to one lot of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, J&J said last week. The company added that testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as recently as a month ago found no asbestos in their talc.  Commenting on CVS\u2019s move, J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said, \u201cIt\u2019s temporary ... They are doing it storewide because they don\u2019t have the resources to go through at the store level and check all the SKUs (stock keeping units), check all the lot numbers.\u201d  Other retailers are also expected to remove the product from their shelves as they want to avoid liability, said Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of private equity firm Patriarch Organization.  \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see Amazon and other online retailers do the same,\u201d he added.  J&J has known for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc, Reuters reported last year. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company\u2019s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.  Company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it, while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public, Reuters found.  J&J has repeatedly said that its talc products are safe, and that decades of studies have shown them to be asbestos-free and that they do not cause cancer.","377":"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada reached an agreement in principle on Monday with both Novavax Inc NVAX.O and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N for millions of doses of their experimental coronavirus vaccines, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.

Trudeau also said the government will invest C$126 million ($96.7 million) over two years to build a biomanufacturing facility at the Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre in Montreal capable of producing up to 2 million doses of a vaccine per month by next year.  Last week, Canada's National Research Council said it had ended its partnership on a coronavirus vaccine with China's CanSino Biologics 6185.HK because the company lacked the authority to ship the vaccine.  Separately, Canada extended to the end of October a program to provide loans of up to C$40,000, a quarter of which is forgivable, to small businesses struggling amid the pandemic. It had been due to expire on Monday.  Novavax said it expects to finalize an advance purchase agreement to supply doses of the vaccine, beginning as early as the second quarter of next year.  Novavax has agreed to supply up to 76 million doses of its experimental vaccine, while Johnson & Johnson will supply up to 38 million doses of its vaccine candidate.  Both agreements are subject to the vaccines obtaining licenses from Health Canada.  Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

Joanne Anderson, 68, was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a form of cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure. The case marked the second trial loss for J&J over similar allegations.  J&J has denied that its talc products contain asbestos or cause cancer, citing decades of testing by independent laboratories and scientists. But plaintiffs claim asbestos and talc, which are closely linked minerals, are intermingled in the mining process, making it impossible to remove the carcinogenic substance.  Of Wednesday\u2019s $21.7 million in compensatory damages, J&J was assigned 67 percent of the liability, Anderson\u2019s lawyer, Chris Panatier, said.  In addition to J&J, Anderson and her husband last year sued a unit of Imerys SA, Cyprus Amax Minerals, a unit of Brenntag, Honeywell International and other talc suppliers. It was not immediately clear whether any companies besides J&J were subject to the verdict.  The Imerys unit, Imerys Talc America, was previously dismissed from the lawsuit, a spokesman said.  Panatier on Thursday did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  J&J in a statement said it was disappointed with the decision and would begin the appeals process. \u201cWe will continue to defend the safety of our product because it does not contain asbestos or cause mesothelioma,\u201d the company said.  J&J is battling some 9,000 cases claiming its talc products cause ovarian cancer, but the talc litigants have recently focused on claims based on alleged asbestos contamination.  A New Jersey state court jury in April ordered J&J and Imerys Talc America to pay $117 million to a man who alleged he developed mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure from J&J Baby Powder.  An appeal is pending.  A California jury in November last year cleared J&J of liability in another mesothelioma lawsuit.

The move would be the first arranged by the European Union executive since it was mandated last week by the 27 EU national governments to use an emergency fund with more than 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) available to reach advance purchase or call-option deals with up to six vaccine makers.  The Commission\u2019s deal with the U.S. firm Johnson & Johnson is \u201cin the pipeline\u201d, a top health official from an EU member state said, asking to remain anonymous as was mentioning confidential discussions about vaccines between the EU executive and EU governments.  A second EU source said the Commission had a call with Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday over the possible agreement on its potential vaccine.  A Commission spokesman had no comment. Johnson & Johnson was not immediately available for comment outside U.S. business hours.  It was unclear whether any deal would involve an advance purchase of the vaccine in testing, or an option to buy it.  Johnson & Johnson plans next month to start human clinical trials for its experimental vaccine against the highly contagious coronavirus, which has infected more than 8.36 million people worldwide, with 447,985 deaths.  Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands said last week they had acquired 400 million potential vaccine doses, in principle available to all member states, from British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which is developing a COVID-19 shot in conjunction with Oxford University.  AstraZeneca signed a similar deal in May with the United States.  DEAL AS SOON AS NEXT WEEK?  The health official from an EU state said the EU deal with Johnson & Johnson could be announced as early as next week, but cautioned that it might take a little longer to finalise, and there were still chances it might not be struck at all.  EU decision-making procedures pose a sticking point for the potential deal, with member states still in talks over the establishment of a steering board for vaccine negotiations with drugmakers, officials told Reuters.  They said that under a draft plan devised by the EU Commission, which is still to be approved by EU governments, a green light from just four member states would be enough to start formal EU talks with a drugmaker.  But, underlining the urgency of securing a vaccine for the EU\u2019s 450 million population, the Commission had already begun talks with Johnson & Johnson even before the steering board has been agreed.  By buying vaccines under development, the EU risks acquiring shots that may eventually prove unsuccessful against COVID-19.  But the risk is justified by the need to secure enough doses for the EU population in the global race for an effective vaccine, EU officials say.

Researchers had been left \u201cfurious\u201d that they weren\u2019t given any prior warning and had to let down hundreds of people already scheduled to participate, he said.  \u201cAt first they contact you, say they want all this, you get geared up and then overnight they tell you \u2018that\u2019s it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou understand the need to be more flexible... but it is hard for the research community in a study like this when the rules of the game change so quickly.\u201d  Peru, Chile, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia had all offered to participate in the trial, hoping that would give them preferential access to J&J\u2019s vaccine in the global race to stockpile doses. J&J told Reuters in September that those hosting trials would have priority for vaccine supply.  Now some in government circles and the public health community fear those deals could be compromised. And local researchers have been left wondering whether they will be fully compensated for their investment in incomplete trials.  J&J has not provided details on where the cap in numbers would impact most. The company did not comment on the status of supply deals or on compensation arrangements for researchers.  The drugmaker expects an initial analysis of the data by late January. If the trial proves successful, the company plans to seek U.S. authorization in February.  SEEKING SUPPLY  To date, none of the six countries in Latin America participating in the trial has finalized a vaccine supply agreement with J&J, even though they still do not have enough doses from other vaccine makers to inoculate all of their citizens. Health officials in all six countries said that negotiations were still in progress.  Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, who has extensive disease research experience in Latin America, said ensuring both rich and poor countries had good access to vaccines was a \u201ckey social justice issue for the world.\u201d  \u201cCountries in Latin America, as they are establishing trial sites, need to pressure for these deals when they are negotiating with the industry. But also it\u2019s on the companies,\u201d he said.  Ko cited the approach of AstraZeneca Plc to helping less wealthy nations produce and distribute its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, developed with Oxford University.  AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine is viewed as one of the best hopes for many developing countries because of its cheaper price and ability to be transported at normal fridge temperatures.  J&J turned to Latin America when infection rates there spiked, as a way to accelerate testing of the vaccine and gauge its effectiveness in diverse populations. The drugmaker shared its plans for the region with Reuters in September, saying it aimed to enroll 20,000 participants in the six countries by November.  The J&J vaccine is easier to transport and store and is administered in a single shot, unlike vaccines from front-runners Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, which are delivered in two doses.  J&J has signed an agreement in principle to provide the COVAX vaccine program with up to 500 million doses of its vaccine through 2022 for distribution to lower income countries.  \u201cThis vaccine would be a game changer because of that single dose, not just for Latin America but for Asia, South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and much of the world,\u201d said Ko. \u201cTwo doses is exponentially more difficult to administer. I would think countries would jump on this if a safe and effective one-dose vaccine comes onboard.\u201d  Brazil has signed non-binding letters of intent to purchase vaccines from four companies including J&J, with health officials indicating a preference for the J&J single-dose shot.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Mexico\u2019s Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said earlier this month at a news conference that hosting the Janssen trial would give the country priority access to the vaccine. Foreign secretary Marcelo Ebrard said last week Mexico could order 22 million doses under a memorandum of understanding.  The Mexican government declined to comment on the halting of trial recruitment and the likelihood now of a priority vaccine supply deal.  A Peruvian government source told Reuters that new deals could be announced in the coming days, but declined to comment on which companies they could involve.  The source said that there were constant surprises in the fast-moving negotiations taking place between governments and pharmaceutical companies around the world in the race to lock in deals, with intense and regular back-and-forth around price, quantity, delivery times and contractual conditions.  \u201cThings change so fast that I could tell you something now and tomorrow it will be outdated,\u201d he said.  FAMILY AFFAIR  During a conference call that Janssen - J&J\u2019s pharmaceuticals division - convened with scientists from 100 Latin American trial sites on Dec. 9, local researchers, who had been working at full speed to help the company meet its ambitious goals, voiced their anger at the sudden announcement they should now wrap up their operations when their target volunteer numbers were not yet met and they had hundreds of people scheduled to be screened and vaccinated, according to two participants.  J&J in the statement issued on Friday expressed \u201cits thanks to all participants, trial sites and health care professionals involved in the ENSEMBLE study.\u201d It did not comment on the angry reaction over the conference call.  In all, the Latin American sites appear to have enrolled about 16,000 people, according to a Reuters tally of figures reported by trial leaders and governments.  Any shortfall would be meaningful for individual research sites, who are paid based on the number of people they recruit. Reuters could not determine the range of what researchers are paid, which varies depending on a number of factors, including their specific locations, third-party partners and target size of trials.  The urgency to sign people up quickly was evident at a site in Colina, Chile, late November, where a Reuters journalist was among the dozens of volunteers who moved along the queue in a narrow waiting room.  Most of those volunteering were medical workers, the worst-hit by the pandemic, and their families. Trial staff also signed up their own families and friends to help make their numbers, they told Reuters.  The start of trials in Chile, Peru and Mexico were delayed by several weeks, held up by factors like regulatory scrutiny, technical glitches and a scramble to get supplies.  In Brazil, the effort began without a hitch in October, with people from all walks of life taking part, said a researcher.  \u201cThere were thousands who volunteered. People are very enthusiastic to help and put up with long waits,\u201d said Eduardo Vasconcellos, trial leader at the L2iP clinical research institute in Brasilia.  Alejandra Camino, a trial investigator at privately-run DIM health clinics in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, said that, although the abrupt end to enrollment was not ideal, it was important to remain flexible in the fight against COVID-19.  \u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment because if you set it up and found a venue, your operation is now going to be out of pocket,\u201d she said of her colleagues\u2019 work on their trials. \u201cBut we are talking about a pandemic.\u201d","388":"Aug 20 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson aims to test its experimental coronavirus vaccine in up to 60,000 volunteers in a late-stage trial scheduled to start in September, according bit.ly\/3iWRuic to a U.S. government database of clinical trials.  Shares of the company rose marginally on Thursday, paring their earlier losses, after the Wall Street Journal first reported the news.  Rival coronavirus vaccine makers such as Moderna Inc and Pfizer are targeting recruiting up to 30,000 volunteers for their late-stage studies.","389":"CHICAGO, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Wednesday kicked off a final 60,000-person trial of a single-shot COVID-19 vaccine that potentially would simplify distribution of millions of doses compared with leading rivals using two doses.  The company expects results of the Phase III trial by year end or early next year, Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J\u2019s chief scientific officer, said in a joint press conference with officials from the National Institutes of Health and the Trump administration.  Rival vaccines from Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca all require two shots separated by several weeks, which make them much more difficult to administer.  \u201cThe benefits of a single-shot vaccine are potentially profound in terms of mass immunization campaigns and global pandemic control,\u201d Dr. Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher who helped design J&J\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, said in a telephone interview.  Stoffels said J&J would publish a detailed study protocol for its phase 3 trial Wednesday on the company\u2019s website, joining the three other vaccine makers that have made these study plans available in recent weeks after calls for increased transparency in the trials.  Stoffels said J&J started the phase 3 trial after seeing positive results in its phase 1\/2 trial in the United States and Belgium. The company plans to release those results imminently.  Stoffels said the safety and level of protection in the study were on par with what was seen in the company\u2019s animal studies, and said the results showed a single dose could offer sufficient protection \u201cfor a long time.\u201d  J&J\u2019s late-stage trial will use as many as 215 sites in the United States, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The company plans to manufacture as many as 1 billion doses in 2021, and more after that, Stoffels said.  The goal of the trial is to test whether the vaccine can prevent moderate to severe COVID-19 after a single dose, but it will also look to see if the vaccine can prevent serious disease requiring medical intervention and whether it can prevent milder cases of the virus.  Stoffels predicts it will take six weeks to two months to enroll the trial, and said the company hopes to get an answer on whether the vaccine works \u201caround the end of the year or early next year.\u201d  It is not clear how fast the company could get regulatory approval, but J&J plans to manufacture doses before approval, so it could start distribution quickly.  The trial will be overseen by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that will review vaccine safety and effectiveness. In the press conference, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said all three of the vaccines being organized and supported by the federal government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed - J&J\u2019s, Moderna\u2019s and AstraZeneca\u2019s - share a common DSMB. Pfizer is running its own trial and has a separate DSMB, Collins said.  J&J\u2019s trial is designed to test for a vaccine that is 60%effective. In the study protocol, that could be determined after 154 people became infected with the virus. Stoffels said the company will start counting cases of COVID-19 infections within the study population 15 days after individuals are vaccinated.  The DSMB will take its first look at the vaccine\u2019s efficacy after 20 people have become infected.  Collins said the DSMB does not include any federal employees and is made up of \u201cvery highly experienced\u201d scientists and statistical experts.  \u201cUntil they are convinced that there\u2019s something there that looks promising, nothing is unblinded and sent to the FDA. So everybody should feel pretty reassured,\u201d Collins said. His comments follow concerns government scientists may be pressured to rush the vaccine testing process to boost U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election bid.

J&J faces more than 16,000-talc related lawsuits nationwide, the majority of which are pending before U.S. District Judge Freda Wolfson in New Jersey. The lawsuits allege that the company\u2019s talc products have been contaminated with asbestos and can cause ovarian cancer.  J&J said in a statement that Monday\u2019s decision \u201cis not a determination by the court on the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations.\u201d It added that all verdicts against the company in talc lawsuits that had gone through the appeals process have been overturned.  The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company denies that its talc causes cancer, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free.  The ruling by Wolfson will allow plaintiffs to present expert testimony that J&J\u2019s talc products can cause cancer based on epidemiological studies. They will be allowed to testify that the link could be caused by contamination with asbestos and heavy metals.  Wolfson also ruled that the plaintiffs\u2019 experts cannot testify that inhaling talc can travel to the ovaries if inhaled, though they may say that it can reach the ovaries when used vaginally.

The latest example of that truism came Friday in litigation in federal court in Trenton, where a trust led by retired Harvard law professor Hal Scott is trying to establish for the first time that corporate bylaws can impose mandatory arbitration on shareholders. The litigation, as I\u2019ve told you before, has been counterintuitive from its beginning in March. Scott\u2019s trust is a shareholder of Johnson & Johnson, yet the trust is suing to force J&J to allow it to propose a mandatory arbitration provision to cut off all shareholders\u2019 rights to sue for securities law violations.  J&J, meanwhile, contends that mandatory shareholder arbitration is illegal under state and federal law so it has assumed the weird posture of defending shareholders\u2019 right to file securities class actions. Noting that anomaly, two big state pension funds, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System and the Colorado Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Association, moved last month to intervene in the litigation to assure that U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp of Trenton isn\u2019t depending on J&J alone to represent shareholders\u2019 interests.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  On Friday, Johnson & Johnson and the pension funds filed separate motions to dismiss the suit by Scott\u2019s client, the Doris Behr 2012 Irrevocable Trust. The two briefs assert overlapping but not identical arguments for why Judge Shipp should end the case now. Judge Shipp has not yet ruled on the funds\u2019 motion to intervene, which may still be opposed by the trust. But the dismissal briefs show, if nothing else, that the pension funds, which own a combined 10 millions shares of J&J, deserve to be heard in a critical test of their right to sue for securities violations.  Harvard professor Scott said in an email that he is not commenting on the litigation.  The crux of arguments by both J&J and the pension funds is that corporate bylaws govern only a corporation\u2019s internal affairs and cannot be used to restrict shareholders\u2019 external rights under federal securities laws. Both briefs reminded Judge Shipp that the Attorney General of New Jersey, where J&J is headquartered, already made that very point to the Securities and Exchange Commission last January, when the SEC was weighing J&J\u2019s request for permission to exclude the Behr trust\u2019s mandatory arbitration proposal from the proxy materials sent to J&J shareholders.  The New Jersey AG, as the briefs explained, sent the SEC a letter opining that the proposal would be illegal under New Jersey\u2019s corporate law because corporate bylaws cover only internal corporate affairs. The state AG, Gurbir Grewal, cited, among other precedent, a December 2018 opinion from Vice-Chancellor Travis Laster of Delaware Chancery court in Sciabacucchi v. Salzberg, which examined the distinction between internal corporate affairs governed by bylaws and external affairs outside of their case in a case challenging the legality of forum selection clauses. The SEC considered the New Jersey AG\u2019s opinion sufficiently weighty to make it the basis of the commission\u2019s decision in February to bless J&J\u2019s exclusion of the trust\u2019s mandatory arbitration proposal.  The company and the pension fund argued in Friday\u2019s filing that there\u2019s no doubt AG Grewal correctly interpreted the scope of corporate bylaws, citing case law and commentary dating all the back to Sir William Blackstone. \u201cBylaws are expressly limited to those matters that relate to a \u2026 corporation\u2019s internal affairs, or those affairs relating to the rights and duties of the corporation, its officers and directors and its shareholders,\u201d wrote J&J\u2019s lawyers at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom. Moreover, both briefs pointed out, when New Jersey\u2019s legislature recently amended state corporate law to allow corporations to amend their bylaws to select a forum for certain internal affairs suits by shareholders, lawmakers left federal securities litigation off of the list.  The trust, represented by Walter Zimolong of the Zimolong firm, has argued that under U.S. Supreme Court precedent on the Federal Arbitration Act, most recently in 2018\u2019s Epic Systems v. Lewis, the FAA preempts state laws barring arbitration. Both the J&J and pension fund briefs refuted that assertion. I\u2019m summarizing nuanced and multifaceted arguments, but, in essence, the briefs contend that the FAA preempts only state laws that disfavor arbitration provisions. Because New Jersey corporate law applies generally and doesn\u2019t even mention arbitration, state law does not disfavor arbitration and therefore, according to J&J and the pension funds, is not preempted by the FAA.  The company and the pension funds also argued that corporate bylaws are not a contract between a company and its shareholders \u2013 but the contention received considerably more weight in the funds\u2019 brief than in the company\u2019s. I mentioned above that the dismissal briefs underscore the importance of giving the pension funds a say in litigation that could have deep repercussions for shareholders\u2019 rights. The funds\u2019 analysis of whether bylaws should be considered an enforceable contract shows why.  The funds\u2019 lawyers from Gupta Wessler, Pomerantz and Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman acknowledged that courts have construed bylaws to imply shareholder assent to their terms, notably in 2013\u2019s Boilermakers v. Chevron, in which Delaware Chancery Court okayed forum selection clauses for shareholder litigation against corporate board members. Such decisions have been based on the premise that when shareholders buy stock, they\u2019re on notice that the company\u2019s board has unilateral power to change the bylaws, and that those bylaws are binding.  But that precedent, according to the pension funds, has looked at the compact between shareholders and corporations as a matter of corporate law \u2013 not contract law. As the Supreme Court has interpreted the FAA, arbitration provisions are governed by contract, which means, according to the pension funds, that both companies and shareholders must agree to mandatory arbitration. Under that reasoning, the funds said, shareholder arbitration cannot be imposed by a unilateral corporate bylaw. Shareholder might not even know if a corporation decides to amend its bylaws to impose arbitration of securities claims. \u201cThis falls well short of the consent required to manifest agreement to an arbitration agreement,\u201d the pension funds said.  In the J&J case, of course, the Behr trust isn\u2019t asking for J&J unilaterally to change its bylaws to impose arbitration but for the company to allow shareholders to vote on the trusts\u2019 proposal to mandate arbitration. In fact, as I\u2019ve explained, J&J explicitly opposes changing its bylaws, arguing that it would be illegal for the company to require shareholders to arbitrate.  But the pension funds have an interest beyond the J&J case in establishing principles that will shut down shareholder arbitration proposals by companies that, unlike J&J, want to preclude securities class actions. J&J doesn\u2019t have to worry that some other corporation might try to impose mandatory shareholder arbitration by changing its bylaws. CalPERS and the Colorado pension fund do.  It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how the Behr trust responds to the tag-team attack on its pro-arbitration arguments. Its brief is due on June 28.","396":"Oct 23 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Wednesday lowered its previously reported profit for the third quarter to $1.8 billion from $4.8 billion to account for a proposed opioid settlement payment.

(Read the Reuters investigation reut.rs\/2rAz2TO)  J&J has fought back, saying its talc is safe and has never contained asbestos or any carcinogens.  The trial was the first in which plaintiffs claimed that asbestos fibers in J&J\u2019s talc caused ovarian cancer. It relied on unsealed internal company documents that the plaintiffs allege detail J&J\u2019s knowledge of asbestos contamination since at least the 1970s.  St. Louis Circuit Court Judge Rex Burlison in the ruling on Wednesday denied a J&J request to toss the verdict, saying the jury\u2019s decision and the large award of punitive damages was justified.  The judge said: \u201csubstantial evidence was adduced at trial of particularly reprehensible conduct on the part of defendants, including that defendants knew of the presence of asbestos in products that they knowingly targeted for sale to mothers and babies, knew of the damage their products caused, and misrepresented the safety of these products for decades.\u201d  Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report that the firm knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos could be found in the product.  The company\u2019s stock has dropped more than 13 percent since Friday, wiping out more than $45 billion in J&J\u2019s market value.  Shares on Wednesday were up about 0.4 percent at $128.17.  J&J in a statement said the failed motion was merely a formal step required before appealing the verdict.  \u201cThe same judge has denied similar motions on prior verdicts in his court that were ultimately overturned by the appellate courts. We are confident this verdict will also be overturned on appeal,\u201d J&J said.  The St. Louis jury in July awarded $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages.  Mark Lanier, the women\u2019s lawyer during trial, in a statement said plaintiffs were pleased with Burlison\u2019s decision.  DECADES-LONG USE  The women and their families said decades-long use of baby powder and other cosmetic talc products caused their illness. They allege the company knew its talc was contaminated with asbestos since at least the 1970s but failed to warn consumers about the risks.  While plaintiffs in the long-running litigation in the past had claimed talc itself causes ovarian cancer, plaintiff lawyers in recent months shifted their claims to allege asbestos in the talc causes mesothelioma, a cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure, and ovarian cancer.  J&J denies that its talc products ever contained asbestos and says decades of studies and regulatory assessments show its talc to be safe.  Missouri\u2019s appeals court has overturned two prior ovarian cancer talc verdicts against J&J on technical legal grounds, saying the decisions could not stand following a 2017 U.S. Supreme Court decision limiting where companies can be sued for personal injuries.  The company in its September motion made a similar argument, telling Burlison that the women, the majority of whom were from out-of-state, had no right to sue in Missouri.  J&J also said Lanier during the trial \u201csubstituted proof and evidence with misleading and inflammatory graphics,\u201d including an image depicting J&J pushing a woman off a cliff into ovarian cancer.  But Burlison in his Wednesday ruling said the cases rightly belonged in Missouri court due to J&J\u2019s connection to the state.  More than 9,700 talc lawsuits, the vast majority of those J&J faces, allege asbestos-laced cosmetic talc caused ovarian cancer, while a smaller number claim its use led to mesothelioma.  J&J has won a total of four jury trials, involving both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma claims. A California trial court judge in October 2017 threw out a $417 million ovarian cancer verdict against the company, saying there had been insufficient evidence to support the award.  Juries in four additional mesothelioma trials could not reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials.","398":"(Reuters) - A California jury on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $4 million in punitive damages to a woman who said she developed cancer after being exposed to asbestos in the company\u2019s baby powder, pushing the total damages award in the case to $25.7 million.  FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake - RC1870D27370  The decision in Los Angeles Superior Court comes on top of $21.7 million in compensatory damages that the same jury awarded to the woman and her husband on Wednesday.  Joanne Anderson, 68, was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a form of cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure. The case marked the second trial loss for J&J over similar allegations.  J&J has denied that its talc products contain asbestos or cause cancer, citing decades of testing by independent laboratories and scientists. But plaintiffs claim asbestos and talc, which are closely linked minerals, are intermingled in the mining process, making it impossible to remove the carcinogenic substance.  Of Wednesday\u2019s $21.7 million in compensatory damages, J&J was assigned 67 percent of the liability, Anderson\u2019s lawyer, Chris Panatier, said.  In addition to J&J, Anderson and her husband last year sued a unit of Imerys SA, Cyprus Amax Minerals, a unit of Brenntag, Honeywell International and other talc suppliers. It was not immediately clear whether any companies besides J&J were subject to the verdict.  The Imerys unit, Imerys Talc America, was previously dismissed from the lawsuit, a spokesman said.  Panatier on Thursday did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  J&J in a statement said it was disappointed with the decision and would begin the appeals process. \u201cWe will continue to defend the safety of our product because it does not contain asbestos or cause mesothelioma,\u201d the company said.  J&J is battling some 9,000 cases claiming its talc products cause ovarian cancer, but the talc litigants have recently focused on claims based on alleged asbestos contamination.  A New Jersey state court jury in April ordered J&J and Imerys Talc America to pay $117 million to a man who alleged he developed mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure from J&J Baby Powder.  An appeal is pending.  A California jury in November last year cleared J&J of liability in another mesothelioma lawsuit.

That proposal also called for the drug distributors McKesson Corp MCK.N, Cardinal Health CAH.N and AmerisourceBergen ABC.N to pay a combined $18 billion, but the framework met resistance from some states and local governments.  Negotiations have been ongoing since then, and the dollar amounts have been shifting. J&J in a statement said the additional $1 billion reflected continued negotiations and said additional terms are being finalized.  Paul Hanly, a lead attorney for local governments pursuing federal lawsuits against opioid manufacturers and distributors, said in a statement the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers were \u201cvery pleased\u201d with J&J\u2019s agreement to resolve the cases.  \u201cWe are hopeful other companies defending the numerous litigations will see the wisdom of this step forward,\u201d he said.  Representatives for the distributors and several state attorneys general did not respond to requests for comment.  More than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed nationally largely by states, counties and municipalities seeking to hold drug companies responsible for the U.S. opioid addiction epidemic.  The lawsuits generally accuse drugmakers including J&J of deceptively marketing opioids and distributors of ignoring red flags indicating the painkillers were being diverted for improper uses.  The companies including J&J deny wrongdoing. J&J is separately appealing a $465 million judgment the state of Oklahoma won against it in the first case to go to trial in the litigation.","402":"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson will stop selling its talc Baby Powder in the United States and Canada, it announced on Tuesday, saying demand had fallen in the wake of what it called \u201cmisinformation\u201d about the product\u2019s safety amid a barrage of legal challenges.  J&J faces more than 19,000 lawsuits from consumers and their survivors claiming its talc products caused cancer due to contamination with asbestos, a known carcinogen. Many are pending before a U.S. district judge in New Jersey.  \u201cI wish my mother could be here to see this day,\u201d said Crystal Deckard, whose mother Darlene Coker alleged Baby Powder caused her mesothelioma. She dropped the suit filed in 1999 after losing her fight to compel J&J to divulge internal records. Coker died of the cancer in 2009.  In its statement, J&J said it \u201cremains steadfastly confident in the safety of talc-based Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder,\u201d citing \u201cdecades of scientific studies.\u201d  J&J has faced intense scrutiny of the safety of its baby powder following an investigative report by Reuters here in 2018 that found the company knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc.  Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. (here)  The Reuters article prompted a stock selloff that erased about $40 billion from J&J\u2019s market value in one day and created a public relations crisis as the healthcare conglomerate faced widespread questions about the possible health effects of one of its most well-known products.  J&J has also been the target of a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about its talc products\u2019 safety, an investigation by 41 states into its baby powder sales, which it disclosed in April, and an investigation into health risks of asbestos in talc-containing consumer products by a Congressional subcommittee.  U.S. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, who led the Congressional inquiry, described J&J\u2019s decision to stop selling talc baby powder as \u201ca major victory for public health\u201d.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cMy Subcommittee\u2019s 14-month investigation revealed that Johnson & Johnson knew for decades that its product contains asbestos,\u201d he said.  In response to evidence of asbestos contamination presented in media reports, in the court room and on Capitol Hill, J&J has repeatedly said its talc products are safe, and do not cause cancer.  The company said on Tuesday that its decision to discontinue talc-based Baby Powder in North America was not connected to any of those investigations.  FAMILY-FRIENDLY IMAGE  Apart from the baby powder controversy the company, one of the most trusted brands in America, more recently has faced a series of legal and reputational challenges.  J&J has said it has been named as a defendant, along with other drugmakers, in more than 2,900 lawsuits alleging the companies improperly promoted addictive opioids.  In August, an Oklahoma judge rendered the first verdict in that litigation, ordering J&J to pay $572.1 million to the state for its part in fueling an opioid epidemic by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers.  J&J is appealing the Oklahoma judge\u2019s ruling and has denied it caused the opioid crisis.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The company said on Tuesday said it had stopped shipping talc baby powder when the COVID-19 crisis led to limits on shopping and manufacturing, and that now it would wind down North American sales.  \u201cDemand for talc-based Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder in North America has been declining due in large part to changes in consumer habits and fueled by misinformation around the safety of the product and a constant barrage of litigation advertising,\u201d it said in a statement.  Sold continuously since 1894, Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder now accounts for only about 0.5% of its U.S. consumer health business, the company said. But it remains a symbol of the company\u2019s family-friendly image.  An internal J&J marketing presentation from 1999 refers to the baby products division, with Baby Powder at the core, as J&J\u2019s \u201c#1 Asset,\u201d grounded in \u201cdeep, personal trust\u201d and a 2003 internal memo described it as a \u201csacred cow,\u201d Reuters reported.  Christie Nordhielm, a professor of marketing at Georgetown, said it appears J&J made its decision to withdraw from the market while consumers were preoccupied with the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice time to quietly do it,\u201d she said, adding \u201cit will minimize the reputational hit.\u201d  Shares of J&J were up 0.35% at $149.31 on Wednesday morning after the disclosure.  \u201cWe will continue to vigorously defend the product, its safety, and the unfounded allegations against it and the Company in the courtroom,\u201d Johnson & Johnson said. \u201cAll verdicts against the company that have been through the appeals process have been overturned.\u201d  \u2018STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION\u2019  Krystal Kim, one of 22 women with ovarian cancer whose case in St. Louis resulted in a 2018 jury verdict of $4.69 billion against J&J, said the decision to discontinue the products was \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d J&J has appealed that verdict.  Nevertheless, J&J\u2019s legal challenges likely will continue, some lawyers said.  In April, a New Jersey judge ruled that thousands of plaintiffs who allege J&J\u2019s talc products caused cancer can go forward with their claims, but face limits on what expert testimony would be allowed in trials.  \u201cJust taking it off the shelf today doesn\u2019t end the litigation by a long shot,\u201d said Loyola Law Professor Adam Zimmerman.  Asbestos is known to cause cancer that emerges decades after exposure. Cases involving asbestos-containing products removed from the marketplace long ago \u201ccontinue to be litigated very actively to this day,\u201d Zimmerman said.  Alexandra Lahav, a law professor at the University of Connecticut, said J&J\u2019s decision could help the company reduce the amount of punitive damages by jurors in future trials, however, as those awards are frequently driven by jurors\u2019 desire to punish a company\u2019s ongoing conduct.  J&J said it will continue to sell cornstarch-based baby powder in North America, and will sell both its talc and cornstarch-based products in other markets around the world.","403":"(Reuters) - Wall Street is trying to figure out whether the U.S. insurance industry will bear any costs from a record $4.69 billion judgment against Johnson & Johnson awarded to customers and their families who claimed that asbestos-contaminated talc caused ovarian cancer.  FILE PHOTO: Bottles of Johnson & Johnson baby powder line a drugstore shelf in New York October 15, 2015. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Analysts have flagged talc litigation as a financial risk for insurers, including Travelers Companies Inc, Chubb Ltd and The Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.  On company earnings calls in recent days, they peppered executives with questions about where exposure might lie. Many of the policies were written decades ago, and some liability may have been offloaded to reinsurers, making it hard to tell who might be on the hook for payments.  \u201cI wanted to get a sense as to whether this is going to turn into a bigger deal and catch us by surprise,\u201d said Buckingham Research Group analyst Amit Kumar, who asked about the issue during W.R. Berkley Corp\u2019s call last week. \u201cThe J&J news prompted us to revisit this topic.\u201d  J&J has repeatedly denied that its talc products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos or cause cancer.  Insurance executives have not given definitive answers, citing uncertainty about how litigation will play out or what role reinsurance might play. Policies that may cover asbestos liability were underwritten at least as far back as the 1970s.  \u201cIn J&J\u2019s case, we would not be surprised if the plaintiffs\u2019 bar found a way to trigger coverage under its old liability policies, which we think could lead to additional exposure for insurers,\u201d Barclays analyst Jay Gelb wrote in a research note on Tuesday.  Travelers, Chubb and The Hartford may have exposure, Gelb said.  Representatives for Chubb, Travelers, the Hartford and W.R. Berkely declined to provide additional comments beyond their executives\u2019 remarks during the calls.  Asked whether the J&J judgment is launching a new era of risk for insurers, Chubb Chief Executive Evan Greenberg said he is not concerned. He noted that asbestos litigation against different industries crops up every few years.  \u201cIt could have been Congoleum manufacturers who made floor tiles,\u201d Greenberg said last week. \u201cThis gets a headline because it\u2019s baby powder.\u201d  The $4.69 billion verdict by a Missouri on July 12 is the largest judgment against J&J to date over decades-long allegations that its talc-based products cause cancer. [L1N1U81WS]  The New Jersey-based healthcare conglomerate has said it believes the verdict will not stand on appeal.  \u201cWe are confident that there are multiple grounds for reversal of this jury verdict and that, ultimately, the case will be reversed,\u201d J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said earlier this month.  The company has had previous success overturning large verdicts in cases alleging harm from its products.  J&J, which faces 9,000 cases nationwide over talc, stopped buying product liability coverage in 2005 because it was expensive and not widely available, according to a regulatory filing. Instead, it has a self-insurance program through a subsidiary, Middlesex Assurance Company Ltd, according to a filing and court documents.  J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz did not respond to requests for comment on its insurance coverage.  It is unclear how much of a role reinsurance will play for insurers or J&J.  The Hartford entered a reinsurance pact with Berkshire Hathaway Inc\u2019s National Indemnity Company in 2016 for asbestos and environmental claims. But the terms excluded coverage for \u201calleged connections between talc and ovarian cancer,\u201d Hartford Chief Financial Officer Beth Bombara said during a conference call on Friday.  The Hartford spokesman Matthew Sturdevant declined further comment. Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s vice chairman for insurance operations, Ajit Jain, declined to comment.  Other insurance executives said they have been monitoring talc litigation for years and will continue to do so.  \u201cThe general theme is to let the process play out,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan said in an interview.

She alleged that her decades-long use of J&J talc-based products for feminine hygiene caused her cancer, and that the company had failed to warn consumers about the risks.  J&J denied the allegations, saying decades of testing have shown its cosmetic talc-based products to be safe.  The healthcare conglomerate is battling some 9,000 cases claiming its talc-based products cause ovarian cancer and, in some cases, mesothelioma, a rare cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure, amid allegations the products were contaminated with asbestos fibers. J&J has said its talc products do not contain asbestos or cause any form of cancer.  The unanimous three-judge panel of the Missouri Court of Appeals in the Eastern District, in overturning the verdict, did not rule on the merits of the allegations.  The judges instead said the verdict could not stand following a 2017 U.S. Supreme Court decision that limits where companies can be sued for personal injuries.  The high court ruled that state courts cannot hear claims against companies that are not based in the state or when the alleged injuries did not occur there.  J&J is based in New Jersey and Ristesund exclusively purchased and used the company\u2019s talc products in South Dakota and Minnesota, according to court records.  J&J, in a statement, said it was extremely pleased with the court\u2019s decision to recognize that the trial should have never occurred.  Ristesund\u2019s case was one of more than 60 related talc lawsuits consolidated in Missouri state court, where juries have a reputation for issuing high-paying verdicts. But only one of those cases involved a woman from Missouri, leading many of the cases to be tossed on jurisdictional grounds.  During the appeals process, Ristesund asked the court for permission to present additional evidence tying J&J to Missouri. The judges on Friday rejected her request, saying she had ample opportunity to present such evidence over the past two years.","407":"JOHANNESBURG, Feb 10 (Reuters) - South Africa\u2019s health minister said on Wednesday that the country would vaccinate health workers with Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine in the form of an \u201cimplementation study\u201d in partnership with the Medical Research Council.  \u201cThis will provide valuable information about the pandemic in the post-vaccination community and thus, ensure early identification of breakthrough infections should they occur amongst vaccinated health workers,\u201d Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said.

South Africa\u2019s rand and Russia\u2019s rouble led gains across currencies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).  But gains were limited, as the prospect of higher U.S. fiscal spending could push up treasury yields and drive money away from emerging market debt and currencies.  The dollar retreated as investors showed more doubts about the pace of an economic recovery in the United States.  \u201cThe globally low interest rate environment supports EM currencies. Rising inflation expectations in the U.S. and rising U.S. yields on the other hand are negative,\u201d You-Na Park-Heger, foreign exchange and emerging market analyst at Commerzbank wrote.  \u201cThere is not just uncertainty as to whether the package entails risks of overheating but also as to how the Fed would react ... whereas high inflation puts pressure on the dollar the Fed\u2019s proactive measures would support the dollar.\u201d  Emerging market stocks, which stand to benefit the most from increased global liquidity, rose 0.3% and were trading just below a record high. Most EMEA stocks also gained.  Stocks have by far gained the most from a risk-driven rally this year, even outperforming their developed world peers on expectations that steady vaccination campaigns and stimulus will enable a strong economic recovery this year.  The rouble was set to rise for a fifth consecutive day, hitting an more than two-week high on a spike in oil prices. Investors were also pricing in a possible interest rate hike by the central bank this Friday.  Reuters reported that Russian authorities were considering a new social spending package worth at least $6.7 billion to address discontent over falling living standards before an autumn election.  But concerns about political unrest in the country, caused by the jailing of a prominent Kremlin critic, kept gains in the rouble subdued. Russian stocks fell slightly.  Turkey\u2019s lira dropped 0.8% from a six-month high as investors paused a recent buying streak.

Lawyers for three men and one woman who sued J&J subpoenaed Gorsky in a trial playing out in a state courtroom in New Brunswick, New Jersey near the company\u2019s headquarters.  All four have mesothelioma, a rare and incurable cancer that they said was caused by their exposure to asbestos in Baby Powder applied when they were diapered as infants.  During an earlier phase of the trial, the jury held J&J liable for the plaintiffs\u2019 cancers and awarded them $37.2 million in compensation. Now their lawyers are seeking to persuade a second jury that J&J\u2019s behavior was so reckless that punitive damages are warranted.  J&J fought the subpoena of Gorsky, arguing that he had no first-hand knowledge about the safety of its powders and that the case involves corporate conduct that occurred long before he joined the company in 2012. Compelling his testimony, J&J said in a motion, would set a precedent that could result in other chief executives being hauled to court and \u201cwould serve no purpose other than to harass Mr. Gorsky and divert him from his executive responsibilities.\u201d  Last week, the New Jersey Supreme Court turned down the company\u2019s request to suspend the subpoena, clearing the way for Gorsky to be called to testify.  The stakes are high. J&J faces more than 16,000 lawsuits. They assert that J&J sold powders contaminated with asbestos, a known carcinogen, and failed to warn users. J&J also faces a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about the products\u2019 safety.  In October, J&J disclosed that a contract lab for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had found asbestos in a bottle of Baby Powder produced in 2018.

Less than two weeks later, J&J announced those tests had found no contamination, other than some asbestos it attributed to an air conditioner in the lab.

The results come merely a month after BeiGene scored a win with Brukinsa\u2019s approval to treat patients with mantle cell lymphoma, who have received at least one prior therapy.

REUTERS\/Stringer  U.S.-listed shares of BeiGene fell 5.2% to $166.9 in early trading on Monday.  The latest trial compared the drugs in 229 patients with Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s Macroglobulinemia (WM), a rare, slow-growing blood cell cancer characterized by an excess of abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow.  Brukinsa did not achieve the comparative study\u2019s main goals of showing greater reduction in cancer signs compared with Imbruvica and in reducing at least 90% of production of an antibody that overproduced in patients with WM.  However, it did show greater improvements in safety and tolerability, BeiGene said.  There is sufficient data from the comparative study to have a discussion with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for Brukinsa\u2019s approval in WM, the company said and added that it was too early to talk about regulatory filing.  \u201cIt is unlikely that we would do other trials, I think that there\u2019s potential that with longer follow up this trial in and of itself could suffice,\u201d Eric Hendrick, chief adviser at BeiGene, told Reuters.  Despite Monday\u2019s failure, the trial data suggests Brukinsa has a differentiated safety profile, with fewer patients discontinuing treatment due to side effects, SVB Leerink analyst Andrew Berens said.  Four patients on Brukinsa discontinued the treatment due to adverse events and there was one death, while the group receiving Imbruvica witnessed nine discontinuations from side effects and four deaths, BeiGene said.  Like Imbruvica, Brukinsa belongs to a class of drugs called Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors. It also competes against AstraZeneca Plc\u2019s Calquence, another BTK inhibitor.  BeiGene likely faces an uphill commercial battle versus Imbruvica and Calquence without positive head-to-head data, Guggenheim analyst Michael Schmidt said.  Brukinsa is currently priced at $12,935 for a 30-day supply, roughly at parity with Imbruvica and slightly below Calquence.  The company said it does not believe the trial results cause it to rethink its strategy around Brukinsa\u2019s pricing.

J&J said it did not anticipate a shortage of Tylenol, a commonly used drug for headache and fever, even though the drug \u201cmay have temporarily run out of stock at one location\u201d.  Fears around shortages of some drugs emerged after the coronavirus outbreak wreaked havoc on supply chains and were amplified last week after India, the world\u2019s main supplier of generic drugs, restricted the export of some ingredients as well as medicines including paracetamol, known as Tylenol in the United States.  J&J also said it was taking all possible measures to maximize the availability of its consumer products.  The coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China last year, has spread to more than 100 countries and killed more than 5,000 people worldwide, sparking a rush for everyday items ranging from toilet paper to packaged foods.  Pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and supermarket chain Kroger Co on Thursday placed purchase limits to stabilize inventory.  Kroger placed a limit on the number of cold, flu and sanitary products per order, while Walgreens said it was limiting disinfectant wipes and cleaners, face masks, hand sanitizers, thermometers and gloves to four each per customer.  The company also said majority of its global medical device manufacturing was running at or near normal capacity, and that it does not expect the outbreak to cause any disruptions to its supply of medicines.  J&J said it had business continuity plans in place across its global supply chain network, including maintaining inventory at distribution centers away from high-risk areas and said it was monitoring demand and supply levels.","418":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is on track to roll out its single-shot coronavirus vaccine in March, and expects to have clear data on how effective it is by the end of this month or early February, the U.S. healthcare company\u2019s chief scientific officer said.  FILE PHOTO: Paul Stoffels, Chief Scientific Officer of Johnson & Johnson attends the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland January 22, 2016. REUTERS\/Ruben Sprich  Dr. Paul Stoffels in an interview on Tuesday also said J&J expects to meet its stated target of delivering 1 billion doses of its vaccine by the end of this year as the company ramps up production.  Stoffels said it was premature to say how many doses would be available in March, presuming the company receives emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The New York Times reported earlier on Wednesday that J&J was experiencing manufacturing delays that would reduce the number of doses on hand initially.  \u201cWe are aiming for 1 billion doses in 2021. If it is a single dose, that means 1 billion people. But it will be in a ramp-up throughout the year,\u201d Stoffels said.  Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine is being produced in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India with the help of contract manufacturers in order to build capacity.  \u201cIt\u2019s a few weeks too early to be giving final numbers on what we can launch in the first couple months,\u201d he said.  EXPECTATION FOR HIGH EFFICACY  Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser for the U.S. Operation Warp Speed vaccine development program, said on Wednesday the vaccine could show efficacy at or above 80%.  That would be below the efficacy of about 95% achieved in trials of already authorized vaccines from Pfizer Inc with BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc, but well above the 50% benchmark for approval set by regulators.  It also has the advantage of being a single-shot vaccine, which means it can protect more people faster, and without the cold storage requirements of the other vaccines.  Stoffels said the company set an efficacy target at 60%, but internally has been shooting for at least 70% to 80%.  \u201cWe are very confident that the vaccine will be much higher than 60%,\u201d he said, adding that the \u201caim is for the highest levels, hopefully closing in on what Moderna and Pfizer are doing.\u201d  Interim results from the company\u2019s Phase I\/II study, published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, have helped boost that confidence.  The study showed that 90% of 805 volunteers aged 18 to 55 developed protective antibodies 29 days after a single dose, and that increased to 100% by day 57. The study is ongoing, but the protection has lasted 71 days so far.  Similar data in participants over age 65 will be available in late January.  The study also evaluated the effect of two doses of the vaccine given 56 days apart, and found the booster led to more than double the level in neutralizing antibodies against the virus.  Side effects such as fever, muscle aches and injection site pain, were tolerable and resolved quickly.  Stoffels said the interim data, combined with monkey studies published in the summer showing strong protection against disease and transmission after a single dose, increased his confidence in the vaccine.  \u201cThe likelihood that we can now translate this into humans in our Phase III study hopefully is very high,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ll see in a few weeks.\u201d  Although J&J\u2019s clinical trial protocols allowed for an early look at the data after 20 people became infected by the novel coronavirus, the company intends to deliver data on at least 154 confirmed cases - the target needed to fully assess the vaccine\u2019s efficacy - when it releases results. That should come in the last week of January or the first week of February, Stoffels said.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires at least two months of safety data on half of the study participants to ensure no unexpected side effects crop up. The company crossed that two-month threshold earlier this month.  \u201cThat point came so close to the final analysis that we decided not to do an interim analysis,\u201d Stoffels said.  J&J plans to seek emergency use authorization from the FDA based on the study of the vaccine as a single shot, Stoffels said. If results of ongoing studies suggest people would fare better with a second booster shot, Stoffels said J&J would file separately for a booster dose authorization.","419":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Trade Commission issued civil subpoenas to Johnson and Johnson in June as part of an investigation into whether contracting practices for its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, violated antitrust laws, the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday.

(bit.ly\/2ZkZGze)  J&J said that the FTC had issued a \u201ccivil investigative demand,\u201d or CID, the equivalent of a subpoena to determine if the contracting practices were legal.  Pfizer Inc filed a lawsuit against J&J in 2017, saying its rival\u2019s contracts with health insurers for blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, were anticompetitive and aimed at blocking sales of Pfizer\u2019s biosimilar called Inflectra.  Pfizer said in the lawsuit that J&J had contracted with many insurers to give discounts in exchange for giving preference to Remicade, and to only pay for Inflectra in cases where Remicade proved to be ineffective. Inflectra was approved in 2016 while Remicade went on the market in 1998.  Remicade is an infused treatment for chronic autoimmune disorders and costs about $4,000 per dose, or $26,000 a year, Pfizer said in the lawsuit.  J&J has denied any wrongdoing and is fighting the Pfizer lawsuit.  Pfizer said in a statement that it had received a CID in June.  \u201cAs Pfizer\u2019s complaint alleges, J&J\u2019s unlawful conduct is designed to prevent Inflectra from being able to compete on its primary point of differentiation \u2013 price. Today, Inflectra has an average selling price (ASP) that is more than 22% lower than Remicade,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cDespite these facts, J&J has not lost substantial volume or share of sales \u2013 counter to what should occur in a competitive market.\u201d  Biosimilars are intended to be lower-cost alternatives to expensive biotech medicines. But since they are made from living cells and it is not possible to make an exact copy of the branded medicine, they are not automatically substituted for the existing branded drug the way a generic drug would be.  The drugs treat ailments like rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis.","420":"(Reuters) - A second South Carolina jury on Thursday failed to reach a verdict in the retrial of a case by a woman whose family said her long-term use of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s baby powder led to her death from asbestos-related cancer.

In May, a deadlocked jury at the Darlington County Court of Common Pleas in Charleston failed to reach a verdict in the first trial.  J&J, which denies the allegations, to date has lost two trials and won three in the litigation over whether Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder causes mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure. Jury trials in another four mesothelioma cases have resulted in mistrials because jurors could not agree on a verdict or because the plaintiff died.  J&J, faced with some 11,700 U.S. talc lawsuits, in a statement on Thursday said it believed the mistrials, as well as the verdicts clearing it of liability reflected the \u201cdiligent review\u201d by juries in the cases.  \u201cWe look forward to a new trial to present our defence, which rests on decades of independent, non-litigation-driven scientific evaluations, none of which have found that Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder contains asbestos,\u201d the company said.  Christopher Swett, a lawyer for Boyd-Bostic\u2019s family, in a statement said plaintiffs were disappointed with Thursday\u2019s result. Swett said the trial court judge had urged the parties to consider a settlement, but that J&J \u201crefuses to be reasonable and take responsibility.\u201d  The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company in the past has said that it was not considering to settle talc cases and currently is appealing all jury verdicts against it.

The remaining plaintiffs allege asbestos in J&J\u2019s talc caused them to develop mesothelioma.  J&J has been fighting talc cancer lawsuits for several years, but the litigation shifted in recent months to include allegations of asbestos contamination.  In July, a Missouri jury hit J&J with a massive $4.69 billion (\u00a33.6 billion) verdict in the first trial alleging asbestos contamination has caused ovarian cancer in 22 women.

Luxury beauty company Chanel has removed talc from a loose face powder and dropped a talc body powder because of negative perceptions around the mineral, court documents reviewed by Reuters show.  Revlon Inc removed talc from its body products, and L\u2019Oreal SA is exploring alternatives for the mineral, those companies told Reuters.  The moves come amid a reappraisal of talc in body powders and cosmetics by consumers, regulators and manufacturers. Talc - which is sometimes found in the same rock as asbestos, a potent carcinogen - is used in thousands of cosmetic and personal care products to absorb moisture, prevent caking and add softness.  Thousands of cancer lawsuits, some dating back to 2013, have been filed against body-powder market leader Johnson & Johnson . Allegations that asbestos contamination caused plaintiffs\u2019 cancers began in 2017. Other makers of talc powders also face suits, including Revlon, Chanel and Avon, securities filings and court records show.  Scrutiny of talc products intensified after a 2018 Reuters investigation here reported that J&J knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc and powders. The company has disputed Reuters\u2019 report and maintains its powders are safe and asbestos free.  J&J announced last month that it would stop selling talc Baby Powder in the United States and Canada, attributing the decision to declining sales and negative publicity.  In March, a Chanel representative disclosed in a court deposition that in 2017 the company had stopped making a talc-based body powder, scented with its iconic No. 5 fragrance that it had made since 1924. The deposition was taken in a 2018 case filed in a Los Angeles court. In it, a California woman alleges she got mesothelioma, in part from asbestos-tainted Chanel and J&J powders she used for decades.  Asbestos is the only well established cause of mesothelioma, an incurable rare cancer of the lining of the lungs and other organs.  Chanel representative Amy Wyatt said in the deposition that Chanel was sued for the first time over its talc powder in 2016 and she denied Chanel powders contained asbestos.  \u201cWe know that it was a safe product,\u201d Wyatt said in the deposition. But \u201cwe determined from public perception to remove it from the market.\u201d  Wyatt said Chanel had also removed talc from its loose face powder, but she was not sure when the new formulation would be on the market. She did not say what the talc was replaced with.  Chanel told Reuters that it routinely updates its products \u201cto ensure we continue to meet our customers\u2019 changing needs and expectations,\u201d a spokeswoman said in an email.  Chanel, which continues to use talc in other products including pressed powder, blush and eye shadow, said all the talc it uses is \u201cselected according to strict purity criteria, fully complies with current global regulations, and is safe under standard conditions of cosmetic use.\u201d  The privately held company did not respond to questions about the deposition or litigation.  A Revlon spokesman told Reuters the company removed talc from its body products. He declined to say when or why; he also declined to comment on litigation.  L\u2019Oreal said it is looking for a talc replacement but has not found anything that works as well.  \u201cWell known partial alternatives exist, and we continue to explore and seriously consider performant alternatives,\u201d a spokeswoman told Reuters in an email. \u201cBut none meet the same performance for our products.\u201d  L\u2019Oreal - like other companies - requires its suppliers to certify annually that its talc is asbestos-free, and it does in-house testing, she said.  \u201cWe have not detected any trace of asbestos in any of our raw materials containing more than 20% talcum powder,\u201d L\u2019Oreal\u2019s spokeswoman said.  Other personal care companies have also stopped selling talc powder. Germany\u2019s Beiersdorf said it switched to corn starch in its Nivea baby powder in 2018. Bausch Health changed the formula of its Shower to Shower powder in 2018 \u201cto keep the product in line with market trends and customer preferences,\u201d and not because of safety concerns, a spokeswoman said.  Bausch, which last sold talc powder in February 2019, has been named in 165 lawsuits; 12 are pending, securities filings show.  Avon, which declined to comment, said in a securities filing that 128 lawsuits were pending against it over talc products.  Sanofi, maker of Gold Bond powder, told Reuters it stood by the safety of its talc powder and was \u201cvigorously\u201d contesting talc lawsuits against it.  \u201cSanofi will continue to evaluate its product offerings in light of supply and consumer demand,\u201d a spokesman said.  Globally, consumers are expected to purchase 139,350 tonnes of talc this year, down 0.6 percent from last year, according to Euromonitor International.  Last year, during an analysis of 52 talc-containing cosmetic products, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found asbestos in nine products, including three sold by tween retailer Claire\u2019s and one bottle of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder. All products were voluntarily recalled.  A spokeswoman said Claire\u2019s had stopped using talc, and replaced it with mica in most of its products.  The FDA is analyzing 50 more samples this year and is considering establishing an asbestos testing standard. Canada\u2019s Health Ministry tentatively concluded in 2018 that talc itself may cause lung problems if inhaled, and ovarian cancer if used in the genital area. A final decision, expected next year, could lead to a ban or restriction on the use of talc in certain products in Canada.","431":"A New York state jury on Tuesday awarded $25 million to a woman who alleged that asbestos in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talcum-powder-based products caused her to develop cancer, while jurors in a similar case in South Carolina cleared the company of liability.  The two verdicts come as J&J fights some 14,200 talc-related lawsuits nationwide claiming its talc products, including Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder, can cause ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, a form of cancer linked to asbestos exposure.

FILE PHOTO: The company logo for Johnson & Johnson is displayed on a screen to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the company's listing at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 17, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Josue Bacaltchuk, vice president of medical affairs for Latin America for Janssen, J&J\u2019s Belgian unit developing the vaccine prototype, said countries hosting the trials would also likely get preferential access to vaccines once ready.  \u201cWe expect the majority in Brazil because it\u2019s the biggest country and also the one most affected by the pandemic so we expect a lot of people volunteering, but we expect also high numbers in Colombia and in Argentina,\u201d Bacaltchuk said.  \u201cIt\u2019s the intention of the company to prioritize the countries that contribute to the development of the vaccine and that will have patients participating in the trials, yes,\u201d he added in an interview with Reuters on Thursday.  J&J\u2019s vaccine is one of over a hundred worldwide being developed in response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected nearly 26.5 million people and led to some 869,323 deaths. Latin America has become the epicenter of the pandemic.  The drugmaker is carrying out tests in the United States and Belgium, and has added Chile, Argentina and Peru to a list of Latin American countries where it plans to conduct Phase III trials along with Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.  Its trials globally will include 60,000 volunteers.  The Latin American countries all have high infection numbers, making them attractive testing sites for vaccine developers since it is easier to obtain dependable trial results in areas with high rates of active transmission and infection.  Bacaltchuk said the decision to spread trials so widely was motivated in part by the challenge of securing sufficient volunteer numbers in a region crowded with other pharmaceutical companies conducting trials of their own prototypes.  \u201cI think this is a potential risk and that\u2019s why we are going to a number of centers that is higher than the other companies to cover geographies that are not covered by the other studies,\u201d he said.  He said the response from volunteers in the region has been \u201cquite positive\u201d which he hoped would continue.  \u201cThis is impacting everybody and it\u2019s going to continue to impact even after this is over, the consequences will continue so we need to try and stop it as early as possible,\u201d he said.","433":"(Reuters) - Shares of Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N fell 10 percent on Friday and were on track to post their biggest percentage drop in more than 16 years, after Reuters reported that the pharma major knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos lurked in its Baby Powder.  The decline in shares erased about $40 billion from the company\u2019s market capitalization, with investors worrying about the impact of the report as it faces thousands of talc-related lawsuits.  The stock was the biggest drag on the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and S&P 500 .SPX indexes and was among the most traded on U.S. exchanges. About 28 million shares exchanged hands by 1830 GMT, more than three times its 25-day moving average.  J&J was found to have known about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its products from as early as 1971, a Reuters examination of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents showed.  The report also said the company had commissioned and paid for studies conducted on its Baby Powder franchise and hired a ghostwriter to redraft the article that presented the findings in a journal.  In response to the report, the company said \u201cany suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.\u201d  \u201cThis is all a calculated attempt to distract from the fact that thousands of independent tests prove our talc does not contain asbestos or cause cancer,\u201d Ernie Knewitz, J&J\u2019s vice president of global media relations, wrote in an emailed response to the report.  The company also said Baby Powder was asbestos-free and added it would continue to defend the safety of its product.  At least two Wall Street analysts said the stock appeared to be oversold on the news.  FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  \u201cIn our opinion litigation overhangs are real, and we do not minimize the situation, but the stock pull back does seem over done to us,\u201d BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch said.  J&J, in 1976, had assured the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that no asbestos was \u201cdetected in any sample\u201d of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973 when at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc.  The company has been battling more than 10,000 cases claiming its Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products cause ovarian cancer. The products have also been linked with mesothelioma, a rare and deadly form of cancer that affects the delicate tissue that lines body cavities.  \u201cWe believe it is highly unlikely the company\u2019s exposure to this talc issue will even come close to the $40 billion in lost market cap today,\u201d J.P. Morgan analysts said.  They added that talc was not an issue that would resolve quickly for J&J and expect shares to trade at a lower multiple pending further clarity on the company\u2019s exposure to the issue.  While J&J has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, the products contributed to a mere 0.5 percent of its revenue of $76.5 billion last year. Talc cases make up fewer than 10 percent of all personal injury lawsuits pending against the company.  However, Baby Powder is considered essential to J&J\u2019s image as a caring company \u2013 a \u201csacred cow,\u201d as one 2003 internal email put it.  CFRA Research analyst Colin Sarcola said, \u201cWe see today\u2019s news potentially impacting sales of everything from baby shampoo to prosthetic hips.\u201d  \u201cGiven these elevated risks, we no longer feel JNJ shares are attractive at recent prices,\u201d Sarcola added.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson\u2019s blockbuster blood cancer drug Darzalex significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death in patients who have not been previously treated for multiple myeloma, late-stage study data showed on Tuesday.  The injection when used with standard of care drugs, Celgene Corp\u2019s Revlimid and dexamethasone, reduced the risk of the disease spreading or death by 44 percent at about 28 months in patients who are not eligible for stem cell transplant.  At 30 months, the cancer did not spread in 71 percent of patients who were administered the Darzalex combination therapy, compared with 56 percent of patients on the standard of care treatment, the company said.  The company plans to make its regulatory submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration next year for the treatment, which was first approved by the FDA in November 2015 as a monotherapy for multiple myeloma patients who had received at least three prior therapies.  \u201cThe median age for diagnosis is the 70s and this study involves patients who are over 65. So this study allows us to compare adding Darzalex to the standard of care in essentially the largest portion of patients with multiple myeloma, which are elderly patients,\u201d Mark Wildgust, the vice president of global medical affairs at J&J unit Janssen Oncology, told Reuters.  Darzalex, chemically known as daratumumab, had third quarter sales of $498 million and is expected to bring in $2.01 billion this year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that occurs when malignant plasma cells grow uncontrollably in the bone marrow.

The decision in Los Angeles Superior Court comes on top of $21.7 million in compensatory damages that the same jury awarded to the woman and her husband on Wednesday.  Joanne Anderson, 68, was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a form of cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure. The case marked the second trial loss for J&J over similar allegations.  J&J has denied that its talc products contain asbestos or cause cancer, citing decades of testing by independent laboratories and scientists. But plaintiffs claim asbestos and talc, which are closely linked minerals, are intermingled in the mining process, making it impossible to remove the carcinogenic substance.  Of Wednesday\u2019s $21.7 million in compensatory damages, J&J was assigned 67 percent of the liability, Anderson\u2019s lawyer, Chris Panatier, said.  The jury found that the remaining percentage came from Anderson being a bystander to her husband\u2019s work on asbestos-containing brakes.  In addition to J&J, Anderson and her husband last year sued a unit of Imerys SA, Cyprus Amax Minerals, a unit of Brenntag, Honeywell International and other talc suppliers. But all of those companies were dismissed from the lawsuit.  \u201cOur clients are hopeful that this verdict can further bring light to this unbelievable example of corporate misconduct,\u201d David Greenstone, a colleague of Panatier, said in a statement.  J&J in a statement said it was disappointed with the decision and would begin the appeals process. \u201cWe will continue to defend the safety of our product because it does not contain asbestos or cause mesothelioma,\u201d the company said.  J&J is battling some 9,000 cases claiming its talc products cause ovarian cancer, but the talc litigants have recently focused on claims based on alleged asbestos contamination.  A New Jersey state court jury in April ordered J&J and Imerys Talc America to pay $117 million to a man who alleged he developed mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure from J&J Baby Powder.  An appeal is pending.  A California jury in November last year cleared J&J of liability in another mesothelioma lawsuit.  The company and Imerys\u2019 U.S. unit, as well as a unit of U.S. drugstore chain Rite Aid, are also facing another mesothelioma trial in a South Carolina court.

FILE PHOTO: Bottles of Johnson & Johnson baby powder line a drugstore shelf in New York October 15, 2015. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  A total of 155 tests were conducted by two different third-party labs using four different testing methods on samples from the same bottle tested by the FDA\u2019s contracted lab, the company said.  The tests are the latest effort by J&J to prove the safety of its widely used consumer product after the test by the FDA prompted J&J to undertake a nationwide recall of one lot of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder in October.  The FDA was not immediately available for comment. However, in response to an October announcement from J&J that a smaller number of independent tests also found no asbestos, the regulatory agency said it stood by its findings.  The different test outcomes could have resulted from the fact that contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and there is no standard test for asbestos in talc, FDA officials told Reuters in October.  Tests conducted by the third-party labs showed asbestos was not present in the single bottle that the FDA\u2019s contracted lab had tested, nor was it present in retained samples of the finished lot from which the bottle was produced, the company said on Tuesday.  The company said its investigation concluded that the most probable root causes for the FDA\u2019s reported results were either test sample contamination or analyst error at the lab, or both.  In October, J&J recalled around 33,000 bottles of baby powder in the United States after the FDA said it had found trace amounts of asbestos in samples taken from a bottle purchased online.  The voluntary recall was limited to one lot of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, the company said at the time.  That move marked the first time the company recalled its baby powder for possible asbestos contamination, and the first time U.S. regulators have announced a finding of asbestos in the product. Asbestos is a known carcinogen that has been linked to deadly mesothelioma.  The recall was the latest blow to the more than 130-year-old U.S. healthcare conglomerate that is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including baby powder, opioids, medical devices and the antipsychotic Risperdal.

It was the CEO\u2019s first appearance in a jury trial over allegations that the company\u2019s Baby Powder causes cancer.  Asked by a plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer whether he read all documents linked to a Dec. 14, 2018, Reuters report, Gorsky replied, \u201cI did not read all the documents but I would rely on the experts in these fields.\u201d  Gorsky was subpoenaed by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers as a witness in a trial playing out in a courtroom near J&J headquarters. The plaintiffs, three men and one woman, all have mesothelioma, a rare and incurable cancer that they allege was caused by their exposure to asbestos in Baby Powder in infancy during their diapering.  During an earlier liability phase of the trial, a jury agreed with plaintiffs that the company\u2019s powders had caused their cancers and awarded $37.2 million in compensatory damages. Now plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are seeking to persuade a new jury that the company\u2019s behavior was so reckless that it should award additional punitive damages.  J&J fought the subpoena, arguing that its chief executive had no first-hand knowledge about the safety of its powders and that the case involves corporate conduct that occurred long before he joined the company in 2012. Compelling his testimony \u201cwould serve no purpose other than to harass Mr. Gorsky and divert him from his executive responsibilities,\u201d J&J said in a motion.  The New Jersey Supreme Court turned down the company\u2019s request to suspend the subpoena last week, clearing the way for plaintiffs\u2019 to call Gorsky.  The stakes are high. J&J faces more than 16,000 lawsuits alleging it sold powders contaminated with asbestos, a known carcinogen, and failed to warn users. It also faces a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about the products\u2019 safety.  In October, J&J disclosed that a contract lab for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had found asbestos in a bottle of Baby Powder produced in 2018. The company questioned the finding and commissioned tests on samples from the same bottle and talc from the same lot. Less than two weeks later, J&J announced those tests had found no contamination, other than some asbestos it attributed to an air conditioner in the lab.  J&J\u2019s share price has been sensitive to developments related to the litigation. In December 2018, a selloff wiped out $40 billion in market capitalization following a Reuters report that the company knew small amounts of asbestos had been found in its talc on occasion since 1971. J&J dismissed the Reuters\u2019 report as \u201can absurd conspiracy theory.\u201d To read the Reuters report, see:  Gorsky\u2019s journey to the witness stand can be traced to the lead role he played in company efforts to rebut the Reuters\u2019 report.

J&J became the fourth drugmaker to settle claims ahead of the Federal Court trial against multiple manufacturers and distributors in Cleveland scheduled for later this month. The case is considered a bellwether for more than 2,600 lawsuits by state and local governments that are pending nationally.  \u201cThe settlement allows the company to avoid the resource demands and uncertainty of a trial as it continues to seek meaningful progress in addressing the nation\u2019s opioid crisis,\u201d J&J said in a statement.  \u201cThe company recognizes the opioid crisis is a complex public health challenge and is working collaboratively to help communities and people in need,\u201d it added.  Opioids were involved in 400,000 overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  J&J which formerly marketed the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, said the settlement includes no admission of liability.  The company will pay $10 million to Cuyahoga and Summit counties, reimburse $5 million of their legal and other expenses and provide $5.4 million to non-profit organizations that run opioid-related programs in the counties.  Mallinckrodt Plc finalized a $24 million settlement with the same two counties on Monday. Endo International Plc and Allergan Plc also settled with the two counties in August to avoid going to trial.  The remaining defendants in the Oct. 21 federal trial include McKesson Corp, AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Henry Schein Inc.  OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP succumbed to pressure from the lawsuits and filed for bankruptcy protection in September.  Some plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have compared the opioid cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998.  Earlier in the year, an Oklahoma judge ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $572.1 million to the state for its part in fueling an opioid epidemic by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers.  Purdue Pharma and Teva had settled claims by Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general for $270 million and $85 million, respectively.","445":"A U.S. appeals court on Thursday said it lacked jurisdiction to consider reviving a whistleblower lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson of improperly marketing a hepatitis C drug, after the \u201cJane Doe\u201d plaintiff attempted to substitute in an entity she created in order to protect her anonymity.

FILE PHOTO: The Johnson and Johnson logo is seen at an office building in Singapore January 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Thomas White  The Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas jury\u2019s verdict in favor of Nicholas Murray came in the first case in which a Pennsylvania jury had been able to consider awarding punitive damages in one of thousands of Risperdal cases pending in the state.  \u201cThis jury, as have other juries in other litigations, once again imposed punitive damages on a corporation that valued profits over safety and profits over patients,\u201d Murray\u2019s lawyers, Tom Kline and Jason Itkin, said in a joint statement. \u201cJohnson & Johnson and (subsidiary) Janssen chose billions over children.\u201d  J&J said the award was \u201cgrossly disproportionate with the initial compensatory award in this case, and the company is confident it will be overturned.\u201d It added that the jury in the case had not been allowed to hear evidence of Risperdal\u2019s benefits.  Professor Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond School of Law said he expects the punitive damages to be lowered on appeal, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision which found that \u201cfew awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.\u201d  Tobias said the verdict was about sending a message.  \u201cA jury, if it\u2019s outrageous enough conduct, will award a big number and let the lawyers and judges work it out,\u201d he said.  Tobias added that the verdict could be a sign that J&J will face more large damages awards in other Risperdal cases.  \u201cThe kind of evidence in this trial may persuade another jury or judge to do something similar,\u201d he said.  Murray, like other male plaintiffs in the mass tort litigation over Risperdal, alleges that he developed breasts after being prescribed the medicine when he was a minor. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug in late 1993 for treating schizophrenia and episodes of bipolar mania in adults.  Plaintiffs claim that J&J failed to warn of the risk of gynecomastia, the development of enlarged breasts in males, associated with Risperdal, which they say the company marketed for unapproved uses with children.  In his lawsuit, Murray, now 26, alleged that he developed breasts after his doctors began prescribing him Risperdal off-label in 2003 after a psychologist diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder. Doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines as they see fit, while companies are only allowed to promote their drugs for approved uses.  A jury in 2015 awarded Murray $1.75 million after finding J&J was negligent in failing to warn of the risk of gynecomastia. A state appeals court upheld the verdict in February 2018 but reduced it to $680,000.  Plaintiffs in the mass tort litigation had been barred from seeking punitive damages since 2014, when a state court judge ruled that the law of New Jersey, which prohibits punitive damages and is J&J\u2019s home state, should be applied globally to the cases.  But a Pennsylvania Superior Court ruling in 2018 cleared the way for punitive damages awards, holding that the law of each plaintiff\u2019s state should instead apply.","447":"Vials with a sticker reading, \"COVID-19 \/ Coronavirus vaccine \/ Injection only\" and a medical syringe are seen in front of a displayed Johnson & Johnson logo in this illustration taken October 31, 2020.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.  Johnson & Johnson vaccine 66% effective in global trial  Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine was 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe COVID-19 in a late-stage global trial with nearly 44,000 volunteers that includes regions with worrisome variants of the virus, the company said on Friday. Protection levels 28 days after vaccination varied from 72% in the United States, to 66% in Latin America and just 57% in South Africa, where a potent new variant has become prevalent. Two-dose vaccines from Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna were around 95% effective in pivotal trials. But those were conducted before the highly transmissible new variants emerged. \"Right now, any protection and additional vaccine is great,\" said Walid Gellad, a health policy associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh who was not involved in the trial. \"The key is not only overall efficacy but specifically efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization, and death.\" In a news release, J&J said its vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization across all geographies and against multiple variants. The vaccine uses a common cold virus to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells and trigger an immune response. The company plans to seek emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration next week. (bit.ly\/3cmnnk1; reut.rs\/3opLsJe)  High antibody levels seen in newborns of COVID-19 survivors  A mother's COVID-19 antibodies can cross the placenta, potentially protecting her fetus from infection, researchers reported on Friday in JAMA Pediatrics. Several weeks after the mother's infection begins, antibody levels in umbilical cord blood \"can be as high as - or even higher - than the levels in maternal blood,\" said study leaders Dr. Karen Puopolo and Dr. Scott Hensley of the University of Pennsylvania. In their study, out of 83 women who had COVID-19 antibodies when they gave birth, 72 of their newborns also had antibodies but no evidence of direct infection. \"It is reassuring that maternal infection, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, results in sufficient antibody production for an efficient transplacental antibody transfer to newborns of infected mothers,\" said Dr. Flor Munoz of Baylor College of Medicine in an editorial published with the study. It is possible antibodies created via a vaccine could have the same effect, Munoz noted. Transfer of substances in the mother's blood to the fetus starts around 17 weeks of gestation, she said, which suggests that \"maternal vaccination starting in the early second trimester ... might be optimal to achieve the highest levels of antibodies in the newborn.\" (bit.ly\/3cn3kSM)  Skin problems can persist after COVID-19  Add bothersome skin conditions to the list of symptoms that can follow infection with the new coronavirus, a new report warns. Between April and October, an international registry established by dermatologists received reports of roughly 1,000 COVID-19 patients with itchy welts, rashes, scaly plaques, or pernio, an inflammation of the fingers and toes upon exposure to cold. In half of the cases, the skin problems lasted more than two weeks. That was more often true for patients with scaly plaques and pernio. Given that some of the patients had only mild COVID-19, the data suggest that inflammation from the disease may persist even among those who were not seriously ill, researchers said in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. \"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, appreciation for persistent morbidity beyond the acute phase of disease has increased,\" they said. \"To our knowledge, our data represent the largest dataset to date on persistent skin signs and symptoms of COVID-19.\" (bit.ly\/2McCwta)  Open tmsnrt.rs\/3c7R3Bl in an external browser for a Reuters graphic on vaccines in development.","450":"FILE PHOTO: Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda takes off his mask as he arrives for a European Union summit during the coronavirus lockdown in Brussels, Belgium, December 10, 2020. John Thys\/Pool via REUTERS  VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania\u2019s president said on Friday the country would receive enough COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate 70% of its population by early July, and that this would achieve herd immunity.  The ambitious supply schedule hinges on vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson being approved for use in the European Union, in addition to the Pfizer shot already being administered, President Gitanas Nauseda said.  \u201cWe received assurances from the European Commission president that Lithuania will be able to vaccinate 70% of population by early summer, because we will receive 4 million vaccines during the first and second quarters,\u201d Nauseda said.  \u201cThe challenge is about to change from vaccine shortages to setting up mass vaccinations, so that we use the time optimally and can fully reach collective immunity (by early July). This is the goal we can set for ourselves,\u201d he told reporters.  The World Health Organization has estimated that 60-70% of a population needs to be vaccinated to break transmission.  However, the concept of herd immunity comes with caveats and big demands of what vaccines might be capable of preventing, and some experts say such expectations are misplaced.  Experts point to various still unresolved factors - such as the rate of the spread of the COVID-19-causing virus, whether vaccines can stop transmission or just stop people getting ill, how many people in a population will accept a vaccine, and whether vaccines offer the same protection to everyone.  Nauseda said Lithuania, a Baltic republic of 2.8 million people, will need to vaccinate 10,000 per day by February and up to 35,000 people per day by April to reach the July target.  Between 1,000 and 4,000 people have received the vaccine daily this week, according to government data.","451":"April 23 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson:  * JOHNSON & JOHNSON ANNOUNCES COLLABORATION TO EXPAND MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES FOR ITS COVID-19 VACCINE CANDIDATE IN SUPPORT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S GOAL TO SUPPLY MORE THAN ONE BILLION VACCINE DOSES GLOBALLY  * J&J - COMPANY SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH EMERGENT BIOSOLUTIONS IN U.S. AS PART OF ITS INVESTMENT  * J&J - UNDER TERMS, JOHNSON & JOHNSON IS INVESTING TO EXPAND DRUG SUBSTANCE CAPACITY RELATED TO VACCINE CANDIDATE  * J&J - UNDER TERMS EMERGENT WILL PROVIDE DRUG SUBSTANCE MANUFACTURING SERVICES WITH ITS MOLECULE-TO-MARKET CDMO OFFERING, BEGINNING IN 2020  * J&J - EMERGENT WILL RESERVE OPERATIONS CAPACITY TO POTENTIALLY SUPPORT COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING OF J&J\u2019S COVID-19 VACCINE CANDIDATE BEGINNING IN 2021  * J&J - COMPANY HAS ALREADY BEGUN PREPARATIONS FOR CLINICAL VACCINE PRODUCTION AT ITS FACILITY IN LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS  * J&J - AIM OF INITIATING PHASE 1 HUMAN CLINICAL STUDIES OF ITS VACCINE CANDIDATE IN SEPTEMBER 2020  * J&J - WILL BEGIN PRODUCTION AT RISK AND IS COMMITTED TO BRINGING AN AFFORDABLE VACCINE TO PUBLIC ON A NOT-FOR-PROFIT BASIS FOR EMERGENCY PANDEMIC USE  * J&J - ALSO AIMING TO RAPIDLY SCALE UP VACCINE MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES GLOBALLY, INCLUDING INCREASING CAPACITY IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE U.S. Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","452":"FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017.

The NIH said on Friday it has selected three agents for the study - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N unit Janssen Research's Remicade, Bristol Myers Squibb's BMY.N Orencia and Abbvie Inc's ABBV.N experimental drug cenicriviroc.  The study will enroll up to 2,100 hospitalized adults with moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms in the United States and Latin America.  Immune-modulating therapies are medications that alter the way the immune system works. Severe infections are believed to be triggered by an over-reaction of the immune system, known as a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, and drugs that suppress certain elements of the immune system can play a role in arresting a rapid escalation of symptoms.  This can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure, among other life-threatening complications.  The NIH said its clinical trial - ACTIV-1 Immune Modulators (IM) - will last six months, and the agency will study if the therapeutics can restore balance by modulating that immune response.  All patients will be given Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O antiviral drug remdesivir - the current standard of care - and also be randomly assigned to receive a placebo or one of the immune modulators as an add-on treatment, the NIH said in a statement.

The blockbuster clot prevention drug could not be shown to reduce the rate of dangerous blood clots in a certain group of high-risk patients after discharge from hospital, the New England Journal of Medicine reported.  Participants in the so-called Mariner study had previously been admitted to hospital for a range of conditions that are associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism, such as heart failure, acute respiratory disease, ischemic stroke or infections.  Bayer reported 3.3 billion euros ($3.77 billion) in Xarelto revenues last year, mainly from stroke prevention in the elderly, and expects annual sales to rise above 5 billion euros.  A Bayer spokesman said that the latest results, also presented at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Munich, did not change its peak sales estimate or have any implications for other conditions that Xarelto is approved for.  It is a reversal of fortunes for Bayer, which in July won approval for additional Xarelto use in the potentially lucrative market for atherosclerosis patients.  Bayer has the marketing rights for the drug outside the United States while partner J&J sells Xarelto in the U.S., with Bayer being eligible for royalties on U.S. sales of 20-30 percent.","463":"NEW YORK (Reuters) -  The federal judge overseeing the multidistrict litigation over allegedly defective hip implants made by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s DePuy Orthopaedics unit has entered a $245 million final judgment for six plaintiffs in a case decided by a jury last November.

The decline in shares wiped off about $24 billion from the company\u2019s market capitalization and made the stock the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 indexes.  J&J was found to have known about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its products from as early as 1971, a Reuters examination of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents showed.  Reuters report also showed the company had commissioned and paid for studies conducted on its Baby Powder franchise and hired a ghostwriter to redraft the article that presented the findings in a journal.  J&J has been battling some 6,000 cases claiming its Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products cause ovarian cancer. The products have also been linked with mesothelioma, a rare and deadly form of cancer that affects the delicate tissue that lines body cavities.","468":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawsuit by 22 ovarian cancer patients against Johnson & Johnson went to trial on Wednesday in Missouri state court, marking the largest case the company has faced over allegations its talc-based products contain cancer-causing asbestos.  FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The women and their families suing in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis say decades-long use of J&J\u2019s Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products caused their disease. They allege the company knew its talc was contaminated with asbestos since at least the 1970s but failed to warn consumers about the risks.  J&J denies both that its talc products cause cancer and that they ever contained asbestos.  J&J is battling some 9,000 cases brought by users of its Baby Powder and Shower to Shower talc products, the latter of which was sold to Valeant Pharmaceuticals [VAPI.UL] in 2012.  The majority of those lawsuits claim talc caused ovarian cancer in women who used it for feminine hygiene. A smaller number of cases allege talc contaminated by asbestos in the mining process caused mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure.  The cases that went to trial on Wednesday effectively combine those claims by alleging the women\u2019s ovarian cancer was caused by asbestos in J&J talc products.  J&J lawyer Peter Bicks told the jury on Wednesday that the causes for ovarian cancer are often unknown, according to an online broadcast of the trial by Courtroom View Network.  He said gene mutations and a family history of cancer played an important role and that asbestos was not known to cause ovarian cancer.  Bicks added that testing done by independent laboratories, universities, government agencies, talc suppliers and J&J itself has shown that there is no asbestos in the company\u2019s talc.  But plaintiff\u2019s lawyer Mark Lanier said asbestos and talc, which are closely linked minerals, are intermingled in the mining process, making it impossible to remove the carcinogenic substance. Lanier said there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that talc caused his clients\u2019 ovarian cancer.  \u201cThis case is as simple as asbestos breathed in or put inside of you,\u201d Lanier told the jury.  J&J has lost two talc mesothelioma jury trials in the past weeks. Those cases are currently under appeal.  Juries in California and Missouri have also issued verdicts in ovarian cancer cases totaling more than $720 million in damages. Those decisions have either been tossed out or are still under appeal.","469":"Feb 12 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson:  * France\u2019s vaccines chief Alain Fischer told France Info radio that he hoped the Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine would be available in April  * Fischer also said that, providing there are no bad surprises, France should be able to uphold, even increase, the current rhythm of around daily 150,000 COVID vaccinations.

But for shareholder arbitration advocates, the news wasn\u2019t all bad: The SEC seems to have backed away from its longstanding position that shareholder arbitration runs afoul of federal securities laws, leaving open an avenue for future investor arbitration proposals.  Technically, Clayton simply announced his support for a recommendation from the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporate Finance that the SEC decline to bring an enforcement action against Johnson & Johnson if the company refuses to allow shareholders to vote on a mandatory arbitration proposal by a J&J investor. Harvard emeritus law professor Hal Scott, who serves as trustee of the Doris Behr 2012 Irrevocable Trust, notified J&J in November of the trust\u2019s proposal that the company allow shareholders to vote at their annual meeting in April to amend J&J\u2019s bylaws to require investors to arbitrate any disputes with the company as individuals. (Yes, it may seem counterintuitive that a shareholder wants to force a corporation to allow fellow shareholders to vote to give up their right to sue, but such is the nature of shareholder proposals.)  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  Johnson & Johnson, represented by Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom, sent a letter to the SEC in December, asking for the SEC\u2019s blessing to exclude the trust\u2019s proposal from shareholder proxy materials. J&J\u2019s argument in that December letter was that mandatory shareholder arbitration violates the anti-waiver provisions of federal securities laws, which preclude delegation of enforcement to arbitrators. Skadden pointed out that in 2012, when the SEC was reviewing mandatory arbitration proposals pushed by Michigan law professor Adam Pritchard on behalf of  shareholders at Pfizer and Gannett, SEC staff agreed that such proposals could \u201ccause the company to violate the federal securities laws.\u201d In those cases, the SEC allowed Pfizer and Gannett to exclude the shareholder proposals from a vote based on the potential federal securities law conflict, so, according to Skadden, it should do the same for J&J.  Scott replied that since 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly endorsed arbitration as an alternative forum for the vindication of rights conferred by federal law, most recently in 2018\u2019s Epic Systems v. Lewis. The Epic decision, Scott argued, stands for the proposition that oversight by federal agencies, whether the SEC in the case of mandatory shareholder arbitration or the National Labor Relations Board in the Epic case, is no bar to resolving disputes by arbitration.  In January, the back-and-forth between Scott and J&J in letters to the SEC shifted from federal securities law to state corporate law. (The letters are included in Monday\u2019s public filing by the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporate Finance.) Last December, as you may recall, Vice-Chancellor Travis Laster of Delaware Chancery Court ruled, in a case considered a harbinger of a prospective test of the legality of mandatory arbitration, that Delaware corporate law does not allow companies to select the forum for the resolution of external claims by shareholders, including claims under federal securities law. After Laster\u2019s decision in Sciabacucchi v. Salzberg, Johnson & Johnson, which is incorporated in New Jersey, obtained an opinion from counsel at Lowenstein Sandler that New Jersey law would also preclude mandatory shareholder arbitration.  The attorney general of New Jersey, Gurbir Grewal, subsequently sent the SEC a Jan. 29 letter advising that the J&J shareholder proposal would violate state law. The New Jersey AG cited Delaware\u2019s Sciabacucchi ruling, explaining that New Jersey courts often look to Delaware for guidance. \u201cThe proposal\u2019s provisions on mandatory arbitration of federal securities law claims are not ones which New Jersey law permits to be set forth in the bylaws of a business corporation,\u201d the AG letter said. \u201cThese provisions would not address the internal concerns of Johnson & Johnson, but rather would seek to regulate external relationships of the company that are governed by federal law. Accordingly, the proposed bylaw amendment would violate New Jersey corporate law.\u201d  The New Jersey AG\u2019s opinion carried the day for the SEC\u2019s corporate finance staff. The SEC\u2019s no-action letter to Johnson & Johnson said it regarded the AG\u2019s letter as \u201ca legally authoritative statement that we are not in a position to question,\u201d and that, in light of the AG\u2019s position, the SEC would not recommend an enforcement action if J&J excluded the mandatory arbitration proposal from a shareholder vote.  The SEC said it was not expressing a view on whether the New Jersey AG was right or wrong, suggesting that if J&J or Hal Scott wanted a definitive determination on the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration under New Jersey law, they should go to court.  The SEC letter ducked the federal-law question that had dominated early arguments by both Scott and J&J. \u201cWe are also not expressing a view as to whether the proposal, if implemented, would cause the company to violate federal law,\u201d the letter said. \u201cChairman Clayton has stated that questions regarding the federal legality or regulatory implications of mandatory arbitration provisions relating to claims arising under the federal securities laws should be addressed by the Commission in a measured and deliberative manner.\u201d  Clayton\u2019s announcement emphasized that the Corporate Finance division\u2019s no-action recommendation was based on the New Jersey AG\u2019s interpretation of state law \u2013 and also warned, once again, that no one should expect quick answers from the SEC on the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration under federal securities laws. \u201cSince 2012, when this issue was last presented to staff in the Division of Corporation Finance in the context of a shareholder proposal, federal case law regarding mandatory arbitration has continued to evolve,\u201d the SEC chair wrote. \u201cFurther, I am not aware of any circumstances where the Commission has weighed in on the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration in the context of federal securities law. In light of the unsettled and complex nature of this issue, as well as its importance, I agree with the approach taken by the staff to not address the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration in the context of federal securities laws in this matter, and would expect our staff to take a similar approach if the issue were to arise again.\u201d  So why do Hal Scott and Adam Pritchard say the SEC\u2019s handling of the J&J case represents some progress for shareholder arbitration proponents?  Because the SEC did not contend mandatory shareholder arbitration is illegal as a matter of federal law, which was the basis of the 2012 no-action letters to Pfizer and Gannett. \u201cThe SEC has reversed its position,\u201d Scott told me in an interview Wednesday. \u201cThe most significant thing about this letter is that the SEC didn\u2019t say the proposal would be illegal under federal law.\u201d  Added Pritchard: \u201cThey\u2019ve backed away from an obviously frivolous position.\u201d  Scott said he plans to appeal the SEC staff\u2019s recommendation to the commissioners. He said he doesn\u2019t expect to win, but believes that the SEC\u2019s framing of its recommendation as a matter of state law leaves room for him to argue that the commission must confront the federal law issue because federal securities laws preempt state law. In the past, Scott said, the SEC has said it would not issue no-action letters based on ambiguous state law \u2013 a rule, he said, that should certainly apply in these circumstances.  At the very least, Scott said, the SEC\u2019s no-action letter leaves open the prospect of mandatory shareholder arbitration for corporations based in states whose corporate codes would permit it. (I should point out that Vice-Chancellor Laster\u2019s Sciabacucchi ruling is on appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court so we can\u2019t be sure even what Delaware\u2019s final word will be on corporations picking a forum for federal securities claims.) I asked Scott whether he\u2019s working on more shareholder proposals calling for mandatory arbitration, perhaps in a state with an AG who won\u2019t put up a fight. He declined to say.  The SEC declined to provide a statement responding to comments from Scott and Pritchard, and J&J counsel Marc Gerber of Skadden declined to comment through a firm spokeswoman.  But I did talk to Paul Bland of Public Justice, whose group has been a stalwart opponent of shareholder arbitration, about whether we should read the SEC\u2019s handling of the J&J case as a sign that the commission will no longer rely on its previous view of mandatory arbitration and federal securities law.  \u201cI don\u2019t see anything in the staff letter or the chairman\u2019s statement that says the Federal Arbitration Act overrides federal securities law,\u201d Bland told me. He said it makes sense that the SEC didn\u2019t address that question because it didn\u2019t need to. The New Jersey AG\u2019s letter made the case an easy call for the SEC, Bland said: \u201cThe SEC dodged a thorny legal issue and went with an answer that was much more straightforward.\u201d  I asked Bland whether he\u2019s frustrated that the SEC has assiduously avoided reaching a conclusion, as the debate over mandatory shareholder arbitration has intensified, about whether the FAA trumps federal securities laws. Arbitration proponent Pritchard told me, for instance, that he thinks SEC Chair Clayton is putting off a reckoning on that question because he doesn\u2019t want to face Congressional criticism. (In fairness, Clayton has said repeatedly that when the issue is ripe, the entire commission will reach a decision on shareholder arbitration as a matter of federal law, rather than leaving the matter in the hands of Corporate Finance staffers; his implication in the J&J case was that the New Jersey AG\u2019s opinion obviated the need for a final decision as a matter of federal securities law.)  Bland told me he can\u2019t criticize Clayton at all. \u201cI feel like the chairman did investors a huge service,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a huge victory for shareholders.\u201d","471":"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N raised its full-year earnings forecast on Tuesday as it reported higher third-quarter sales of psoriasis treatment Stelara and cancer drug Imbruvica while attempting to alleviate investor concerns over mounting legal challenges.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Shares of the U.S. healthcare conglomerate, which also has huge medical devices and consumer products units, rose 2% to $133.70, contributing to a strong early performance on Wall Street overall on Tuesday.  J&J shares have been under pressure this year, widely underperforming the S&P healthcare sector .SPXHC, as the company faces more than 13,000 lawsuits tied to antipsychotic drug Risperdal as well as a range of potentially costly lawsuits involving its baby powder, opioids, medical devices and other products.  J&J did not report litigation expenses for the third quarter. Its legal costs over the first nine months remained at $832 million, as was reported at the end of the second quarter. It did not respond to a Reuters request for additional details on legal costs.  The company is the first major drugmaker to report quarterly earnings and its upbeat outlook and results could be a positive sign for the sector.  SVB Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy said the quarterly results should be viewed positively by investors, but cautioned that the ongoing litigation overhang could limit any boost share boost.  The company reiterated that it does not expect last week\u2019s outsized jury award of $8 billion in punitive damages J&J was ordered to pay a man in a Risperdal product liability case to stand.  \u201cWe will appeal the amount and you can expect that to come down should precedent hold,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk on a conference call.  Bernstein analyst Lee Hambright was encouraged by J&J reassurances on its legal strategy. \u201cI think they are fighting from a position of strength on talc and on opioids.\u201d  \u201cThey both emphasized on the strength of their case but also projected a sense of pragmatism to settle where it\u2019s the right thing to do for all stakeholders,\u201d Hambright added.  J&J\u2019s pharmaceuticals business has in recent years cushioned the impact of relatively slow growth in its medical device and consumer units. Much of the growth has come from newer treatments such as Stelara, which reported near 30% growth in sales to about $1.7 billion. Sales leukemia treatment Imbruvica rose about 31% to $921 million in the quarter.  The company said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share in the range $8.62 to $8.67, up from its prior forecast of $8.53 to $8.63. Analysts were expecting $8.60 per share.  Excluding items, the company earned $2.12 per share, beating analysts\u2019 average expectations by 11 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Total sales rose 1.9% to $20.73 billion, above the average analysts\u2019 estimate of $20.07 billion.  Pharmaceutical unit sales rose 5.1% to $10.88 billion, above analysts estimates of $10.28 billion.","472":"(Reuters) - The U.S. government has cut deals with Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and Moderna Inc MRNA.O and said it is in talks with at least two other companies to prepare them to produce massive quantities of coronavirus vaccines even before safe and effective ones become available.  There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines specifically for COVID-19, the respiratory disease that has killed more than 35,000 people and infected over 745,000 globally in just a few months.  No vaccine is expected to be ready for use until at least 2021, as they must still be widely tested in humans before being administered to hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people to prevent infection.  On Monday, J&J announced a $1 billion deal with the U.S. government to create enough manufacturing capacity to make more than 1 billion doses of a vaccine, and its shares closed up 8% at $133.01.  It has chosen a candidate but will not begin testing it in people until September.  Moderna, which this month began very early tests of its vaccine candidate in people, also signed a deal with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  The arrangements are part of the federal government\u2019s effort to encourage drugmakers to be able to produce massive amounts of COVID-19 vaccines even before any are proven to work.  The J&J effort will be funded in part by about $420 million from BARDA. The agency told Reuters it also plans to spend an unnamed amount to ramp up manufacturing for Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine candidate.  Moderna shares rose 1.4% to $30.48.  BARDA ultimately plans to support five or six experimental vaccine candidates, with the hopes of having two or three successful ones, BARDA director Rick Bright said in a phone interview.  Experts have estimated it could be 12 to 18 months before a safe and effective vaccine wins regulatory approval.  \u201cGovernment and industry is working in unprecedented ways,\u201d Bright said. The hope is to work \u201cas quickly as possible and manufacture enough of it for us and the rest of the world in a very short timeframe.\u201d  The agency plans to take over manufacturing of Moderna\u2019s vaccine candidate to enable the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech to focus on testing it in larger trials.  BARDA hopes to speed up the back end of the vaccine manufacturing process, which involves ensuring that they are made and packaged according to standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  \u2018A LOT OF RISK INVOLVED\u2019  There are dozens of coronavirus vaccines in development, according to the World Health Organization. But it is still not clear that people develop lasting immunity to this virus, or what it will take for a vaccine to be protective.  \u201cWhat you need to do is take an assessment of what the most likely candidates are and invest at risk in those,\u201d said Seth Berkley, chief executive of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The earlier you make that decision, the more likely you are to have manufacturing in place, but the less confident you are about whether the vaccine will work, Berkley said.  Typically, decisions on whether to move forward with a vaccine are made after safety trials and preliminary efficacy trials have been completed.  J&J said it will begin human testing in September, with an eye toward having a vaccine ready under an emergency use authorization in early 2021.  J&J Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Paul Stoffels told Reuters the company had to start ramping up manufacturing capacity now, even before it has a signal that its experimental vaccine candidate works.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cThat is the only option for us to get it on time,\u201d Stoffels said of the early 2021 target. J&J hopes to have data proving its vaccine works by the end of this year.  J&J has a manufacturing plant in the Netherlands that can make up to 300 million doses of vaccine, Stoffels said, but that \u201cabsolutely will not be sufficient for the world.\u201d  The company is also scouting for manufacturing plants in other parts of Europe and Asia capable of making the type of vaccine the company is working on.  Stoffels said J&J\u2019s vaccine will be based on the same technology used to make its Ebola vaccine, which has been widely used in people. The company believes it will prove safe.  In lab studies, it has produced strong neutralizing antibodies to the virus - the type needed to make a successful vaccine.  In addition to the investments in J&J and Moderna, Bright said his agency is in talks with at least two other large vaccine makers, but declined to make them public.  BARDA is interested in working with a broad range of vaccine technologies and with companies that have proven track records, Bright said.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of risk involved in making a new vaccine, a lot of risk in going quickly,\u201d Bright said. \u201cWherever possible, we need to understand and mitigate that risk.\u201d","473":"FILE PHOTO: Logo and flags of Bayer AG are pictured outside a plant of the German pharmaceutical and chemical maker in Wuppertal, Germany August 9, 2019.

Opioids were involved in almost 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  J&J countered in its own brief that while opioid abuse is a real problem, its painkillers, Duragesic and Nucynta, were a tiny fraction of all opioids prescribed in Oklahoma. It also said its marketing claims had scientific support.  New Jersey-based J&J\u2019s lawyers also wrote that the state\u2019s case rested on \u201cradical theories\u201d unmoored from more than a century of court cases interpreting the state\u2019s public nuisance law, which it said only applies to property disputes.  But the state\u2019s lawyers said applying the state\u2019s public nuisance statute to the epidemic was not an unprecedented expansion of the law.  \u201cWhile this opioid crisis is unprecedented, this exercise of the State\u2019s power is not,\u201d the state\u2019s lawyers wrote.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Johnson & Johnson vaccine advancing through clinical trials  An experimental COVID-19 vaccine from Johnson & Johnson produced protective antibodies against the novel coronavirus in 90% of 805 volunteers by 29 days, and that increased to 100% by day 57, according to data from an ongoing mid-stage study. Side effects such as fever, muscle aches and injection site pain resolved quickly, researchers reported on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. To be approved by regulators, the J&J vaccine must show efficacy as reflected by a lower risk of infections and severe disease in study participants who receive it compared to those who do not. Efficacy data from a large late-stage trial on the vaccine is due by February. Experts expect the vaccine to show efficacy at or above 80%, which would exceed the 50% benchmark for regulatory approval but trail the roughly 95% achieved in trials of already-authorized vaccines from Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc with BioNTech SE. The J&J vaccine requires just a single dose, and it does not have the cold storage requirements of the other vaccines.

(bit.ly\/2LpBhHm)  COVID-19 gives some immunity, and reinfections seen as rare  COVID-19 survivors are highly likely to have some immune protection against the virus for at least five months, and reinfections in recovered patients are rare, with only 44 cases found among 6,614 previously infected people, according to researchers leading a large ongoing study of healthcare workers in Britain. But when people do get COVID-19 a second time, they often have no symptoms, and so they may still be able to carry the coronavirus in their nose and throat and unwittingly pass it on, the researchers wrote in a report published on Wednesday by Public Health England (PHE) ahead of peer review. Experts have said people who contracted COVID-19 in the pandemic's first wave may now be vulnerable to infection again. \"We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total and we do not yet know how long protection lasts,\" said study leader Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE in London. \"If you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections. But there is still a risk you could acquire an infection and transmit (it) to others.\" (bit.ly\/3ihkuBZ; reut.rs\/3ieWorA)  Coronavirus targets cells\u2019 energy engines  Researchers have discovered an important line of attack used by the novel coronavirus: it targets an infected cell's mitochondria. These tiny organelles not only generate the energy that powers a cell's biochemical reactions, but they also play important roles in immune function. \"We knew that when the virus attacks cells, bad things happen - but we didn't know why,\" said Dr. Pinchas Cohen of the University of Southern California, whose team published its findings this month in the journal Scientific Reports. \"Now we can say, when the virus attacks cells, it damages the mitochondria.\" In test tube experiments, the researchers found that the virus caused \"dramatic changes and impairment\" in the genes that regulate mitochondrial function, Cohen told Reuters. The implication, Cohen said, is that energy production in the cells and so-called innate immunity - the body's first line of defense against germs - are then impaired. Another implication is that having healthy mitochondria would help people combat the virus if they do become infected. \"We know that a healthy diet and healthy lifestyle promote mitochondrial health,\" Cohen said, whereas mitochondrial function deteriorates with age and with many chronic conditions including diabetes and heart disease. In the future, Cohen added, researchers may develop COVID-19 interventions to help improve mitochondrial health.

These \"multivalent\" nanobodies - containing multiple nanobody building blocks - \"are substantially better in neutralizing viruses\" and preventing them from breaking into cells, study leaders Florian Schmidt and Paul-Albert K\u00f6nig of the University of Bonn told Reuters. The fused nanobodies \"help each other so that the outcome is better than just the sum of the two responses.\" The nanobody constructs can target multiple sites on the coronavirus, making it harder for the pathogen to develop mutations that render treatment ineffective, according to a report published on Tuesday in the journal Science. While the researchers saw plenty of mutations that allowed the coronavirus to \"escape\" the effect of a single nanobody, \"we did not find any escape mutants that were able to replicate in the presence of those nanobodies that target two different surfaces at the same time,\" Schmidt and K\u00f6nig said. A spin-off company of the University of Bonn, called DiosCURE, expects to start testing the combined nanobody molecules in people later this year.

Research will focus on the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus, the brain-damaging Nipah virus, and the Lassa virus, which causes haemorrghagic fever, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said.  Both J&J\u2019s Janssen Vaccines unit and specialists at Oxford\u2019s Jenner Institute were involved in the development of vaccines against Ebola during the 2014 West Africa outbreak.  The hope is that some of that experience will speed up work against new emerging infectious diseases, CEPI\u2019s chief executive officer Richard Hatchett said in a statement.  MERS first emerged in humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to infect more than 2,200 people in dozens of countries. The vast majority of the cases - around 1,800 of them - have been in Saudi Arabia.  MERS is related to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus and kills one in three of those it infects.  Oxford has started early-stage development of a potential MERS vaccine. In collaboration with Janssen, it will receive $14.6 million from CEPI to fund manufacturing of a batch for second-phase testing, with an option to provide extra funds for possible stockpiling if the results look promising.  CEPI will also provide funding of up to $2.1 million for early-stage development of a Lassa vaccine and up to $2.0 million to explore Nipah vaccine potential.  Both Lassa and Nipah viruses cause small but frequent outbreaks of disease in Asia and Africa, and experts say they have shown the capacity to spread across borders and become fast-growing and potential deadly epidemics.  Hatchett said the deal showed the coalition\u2019s aim: \u201cTo drive development of vaccines to protect humanity against threats posed by emerging infectious diseases and to bring together the expertise of academia and the public and private sectors\u201d.  CEPI, set up in January 2017, was designed to avoid the kind of slow response seen in the West African 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, which killed more than 11,300 people before an effective vaccine was developed.

Due to declining Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the debt underwriting process centered around an absolute debt amount rather than the more typical factor in leveraged lending, a debt-to-Ebitda multiple, sources said.  The Ebitda figure that will be used to market the deal has not been solidified. The metric ranges between US$450m and US$600m depending on whether it\u2019s calculated on a last 12-months\u2019, full-year 2017\/2018, or trough basis, one of the sources said.  Leverage would be 3.9 times and 2.9 times at the low and high end of that range, respectively.  The timing of the syndication of the debt is also fluid, as the closing process is likely to be protracted due to regulatory concerns and the new owner may seek to avoid paying ticking fees, the sources said.

Some trial participants showed serious elevations of liver enzymes and the company concluded that the benefit-risk ratio offered by the drug, atabecestat, no longer supported its development, said Janssen, a unit of Johnson and Johnson.  Atabecestat belongs to a class of experimental Alzheimer\u2019s drugs called BACE inhibitors that block an enzyme involved in the production of a protein that creates brain plaques, which are considered a major cause for the disease.  Analysts expect the successful development of a treatment for the disease, which affects about 5.7 million Americans, to virtually guarantee multi-billion dollar annual sales.  However, several drugmakers, including Pfizer Inc, Merck and Co Inc, have been forced to abandon trials over lack of effectiveness or safety concerns.  Eli Lilly & Co and AstraZeneca Plc are testing their BACE inhibitor, lanabecestat, in late-stage trials and are due to report results next year.

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson\u2019s greed led the drugmaker to use deceptive marketing to create an oversupply of painkillers that fueled the U.S. opioid epidemic, the state of Oklahoma alleged at the start of the first trial to result from lawsuits over the drug crisis.  Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, who filed the multibillion-dollar case, argued in a state court in the city of Norman that J&J should be forced to pay for helping cause the \u201cworst manmade public health crisis in our state\u2019s history.\u201d  His case is the first to reach trial from around 2,000 lawsuits filed by state and local governments seeking to hold pharmaceutical companies responsible for a drug epidemic the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says led to a record 47,600 opioid-related overdose deaths in 2017.  The non-jury trial came after Oklahoma resolved claims against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP in March for $270 million and against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd on Sunday for $85 million, leaving only J&J as a defendant.  Brad Beckworth, a lawyer for the state, told Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman that New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J, along with Purdue and Teva, used misleading marketing beginning in the 1990s to push doctors to prescribe more opioids.  Beckworth said J&J, which sold the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, marketed the opioids as \u201csafe and effective for everyday pain\u201d while downplaying their addictive qualities, helping create a drug oversupply.  He said J&J was motivated to boost prescriptions not only because it sold opioid painkillers, but because it also grew and imported raw materials opioid manufacturers like Purdue used.  \u201cIf you have an oversupply, people will die,\u201d Beckworth said.  J&J lawyer Larry Ottway countered that its products made up a small share of opioids prescribed in Oklahoma and carried U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved labels that warned of the addictive risks.  \u201cYou have to examine the details because facts are stubborn things,\u201d he said.  He also argued Oklahoma was seeking to \u201cstretch\u201d the bounds of a public nuisance statute in order to force it to pay up to $17.5 billion to help the state address the epidemic for the next 30 years.  The case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in other opioid lawsuits, particularly the 1,850 cases consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio, who has been pushing for a settlement ahead of an October trial.  Some plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have compared the cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Justice Gerald Lebovits of the state supreme court in Manhattan reduced the payout from the $325 million a jury awarded Donna Olson, 67, and Robert Olson, 65, in May 2019 following a 14-week trial.  While upholding the jury\u2019s liability finding, Lebovits wrote on Nov. 11 that the damages were too high, and the Olsons could either accept $120 million or have a new trial on damages.  The judge approved the lowered payout on Wednesday, court records show. It includes $15 million of compensatory damages and $105 million of punitive damages, down from an original $25 million and $300 million, respectively.  Johnson & Johnson said it will appeal the verdict, citing \u201csignificant legal and evidentiary errors\u201d at the trial.  \u201cWe deeply sympathize with anyone suffering from cancer, which is why the facts are so important,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe remain confident that our talc is safe, asbestos free, and does not cause cancer.\u201d  Jerome Block, a lawyer for the Olsons, said they were satisfied with the result and confident it would stand.

Johnson & Johnson has faced intense scrutiny of its baby powder\u2019s safety following a 2018 Reuters investigative report that found it knew for decades about asbestos in its talc.  Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.

However, the 541 local governments that opted out included Florida\u2019s Palm Beach County and counties in West Virginia, according to attorneys, raising the prospect that companies could face expensive trials even if they settled with the class. The two regions are among the hardest hit by the crisis, which has contributed to more than 400,000 deaths since 1997.  Officials from Houston\u2019s Harris County, one of the largest U.S. counties, have said it would opt out, meaning they would pursue their own lawsuit and not receive funds from a nationwide settlement.  The court filing did not identify opt-outs.  U.S. Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, who has been overseeing 2,600 consolidated opioid lawsuits, is pushing hard for a settlement to help get funds to those most in need in a timely fashion. He approved the novel \u201cnegotiation class\u201d as a way to reassure companies that any deal to resolve the lawsuits would bind remaining governments and prevent them from filing a case.  The lawsuits generally allege that drugmakers improperly marketed opioids while distributors and pharmacy chains failed to stop suspicious orders. The defendants deny the allegations.  Typical class actions allow members to opt out after a settlement has been reached, but the negotiation class fixes the members first. Any settlement must be approved by 75% of the class.  Lawyers said towns and counties less affected by the crisis had little reason to opt out, while areas ravaged by opioids, like West Virginia, had more incentive to pursue and control their own lawsuit.  The number of opt-outs represented around 20% of those that have already sued and could be significant if it included large cities, according to Elizabeth Burch, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law.  \u201cIf I\u2019m trying to negotiate with a town of 80, that\u2019s very different from Houston,\u201d she said.

Sales in J&J\u2019s medical device unit have been recovering since turnaround efforts began in 2016, and the company now expects that unit to achieve above-market growth in 2020.  Auris was founded by surgical robotics pioneer Frederic Moll, who also co-founded Intuitive Surgical. Moll will join J&J after its acquisition closes, the company said, but did not disclose what role he would play.  J&J\u2019s shares were up marginally at $134.24 in midday trade, while Intuitive Surgical fell as much as 2.5 percent to $526.36 as analysts said Auris could become a formidable competitor given J&J\u2019s commercial scale.  Auris\u2019s flagship product is a robot used by surgeons via a controller to direct a scope through a patient\u2019s body with cameras.  The device, called Monarch, was approved by U.S. regulators last year for diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopic procedures, where an instrument is inserted into the nose or mouth.  Auris initially focused on lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.  J&J said the acquisition would complement its purchase last year of Orthotaxy, a privately held developer of software-enabled robotic technology for surgery.  J&J\u2019s Ethicon unit, which will absorb Auris, has a partnership with Alphabet Inc\u2019s Verily Life Sciences, under which the companies formed a surgery-focused company called Verb Surgical Inc in 2015.  \u201cInvestors have been yearning for an acquisition for JNJ\u2019s MedTech and while this entity may not have been top of mind, it complements JNJ\u2019s Ethicon franchise and its respiratory health focus,\u201d BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch said.  J&J\u2019s agreement also includes additional payments to Auris of $2.35 billion, based upon Auris hitting certain milestones, which J&J did not specify.","518":"MUNICH (Reuters) - German generic drug maker Stada STAGn.DE is buying the rights to anti-dandruff shampoo Nizoral from Johnson & Johnson's JNJ.N Janssen Pharmaceutica and could announce further product acquisitions soon, its interim chief executive told Reuters.

It was to eventually employ at least 1,500 people and help bring development to a rural area near Hyderabad in southern India.  FILE PHOTO: Johnson & Johnson manufacturing plant is pictured in Penjerla on the outskirts of Hyderabad, India April 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Zeba Siddiqui  Yet, three years after the U.S. healthcare company completed construction of production facilities for cosmetics and baby products on the 47-acre site, they stand idle.  Two sources familiar with J&J\u2019s operations in India and one state government official told Reuters production at the plant, at Penjerla in Telangana state, never began because of a slowing in the growth in demand for the products.  One of them said that demand didn\u2019t rise as expected because of two shock policy moves by Prime Minister Narendra Modi: a late 2016 ban on then circulating high-value currency notes, and the nationwide introduction of a goods and services tax (GST) in 2017.  J&J spokespeople in its Mumbai operations in India and at its global headquarters in New Brunswick, New Jersey, declined to respond to a list of questions from Reuters.  Modi\u2019s office did not respond to a call and an email with questions.  Aimed at rooting out corruption and streamlining the tax system, the double whammy of \u2018demonetization\u2019 and GST \u2013 were two of Modi\u2019s signature policy moves. But instead of encouraging economic activity as intended, they did the opposite, at least in 2016-2018, by sapping consumer demand, according to some economists.  Many businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, complained publicly \u2013 some in their financial statements - that they suffered a drop off in orders. The suspended J&J project stands as one of the most vivid examples of the impact on the broader investment picture.  In the first month after demonetization, some business surveys showed that sales of products such as shampoos and soap fell more than 20 percent.  Lack of jobs growth and a farm-income crisis because of low crop prices have hurt Modi in the current general election, according to several political strategists.  Still, Modi and his ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party are expected by many of the strategists to be in a position to get a second term \u2013 probably with support of some other parties - when votes are counted on Thursday, partly because of his strong stance on national security issues.  BIG INVESTMENTS, GREAT EXPECTATIONS  A range of Modi\u2019s business policies, such as capping prices of medical devices, forcing tech companies to store more data locally and stricter e-commerce regulations have in the past two years hurt plans of American multinationals such as J&J, Mastercard, Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart.  The groundbreaking of the J&J facility in Penjerla, its third in the country, was carried out with much fanfare in 2014, attended by Telangana state\u2019s Chief Minister Chandrashekar Rao, who hailed the foreign investment as a big win for local communities. A document dated April 2017 that lists products the company planned to make at the facility, submitted to the Telangana government and reviewed by Reuters, names baby oil, baby shampoo, baby lotion, baby hair oil, face wash and creams.  Shaukat Ali, running a tea shop under a bamboo stall on barren land outside the plant, said local workers check in routinely for possible vacancies at the J&J site, but nothing has come up in years.  At the local pollution control board office, the member secretary Satyanarayana Reddy said the J&J plant had all the required approvals and he was not sure why it hadn\u2019t started production.  \u201cIt is unusual for such a big plant to stay idle for so long,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is no problem from our side.\u201d  Chandrasekhar Babu, an additional director at the Telangana industries department, said a J&J company official told him the plant hadn\u2019t started due to lack of demand.  GST and demonetization were two key reasons the plan didn\u2019t kick off, one of the sources said, adding that lack of consumer demand since then dented company\u2019s plans.  The second source familiar with J&J\u2019s plans said the company miscalculated Indian market demand.  On a recent visit by a Reuters reporter to the J&J plant, plush, furnished conference rooms and cubicles sat inactive; M. Sairam, who said he was the site manager, told Reuters production areas with machines were idle too.  PLANNED FURTHER EXPANSION  Local officials had hoped the initial J&J plant would be only the beginning. After the groundbreaking in 2014, Pradeep Chandra, who was Telangana\u2019s special chief secretary of industries, told Business Today magazine that \u201cbased on the extent of land (J&J) have acquired we believe that they are looking at much larger expansion here.\u201d  Local media reports at the time said the J&J facility would employ some 1,500 people.  A J&J official, who was not identified by name, was reported subsequently in December 2016 in India\u2019s Business Standard assaying that the $85 million plant would be operational by 2018 after it had overcome procedural delays. The official was quoted as saying the company had earmarked an additional $100 million for expansion.  Vikas Srivastava, the managing director of J&J Consumer(India), who was at the 2014 groundbreaking, did not respond to calls for comment.  Reuters also talked to two workers outside a sprawling Procter & Gamble facility making detergents and diapers, which is next to the J&J plant. They said they were part of the P&G plant\u2019s production team and the plant had been running below capacity.  A P&G spokesperson denied that, saying the plant was \u201coperating at full capacity in line with our business plans\u201d. \u201cIndia is a priority market for P&G globally and in recent quarters, P&G\u2019s business in India has registered strong double-digit growth consistently,\u201d the company said.  The weak rural economy, where most Indians work, has also hurt growth in sales of basic items such as detergents and shampoo in the past year.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd, an industry bellwether that would compete with the likes of J&J and P&G in some categories, said its volume growth shrank to 7 percent in the quarter ended March 31, down from double-digit growth in the previous five quarters.  The company warned that the daily consumer goods segment in India was \u201crecession resistant ... not recession proof.\u201d","525":"Feb 27 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson and other drug companies facing thousands of lawsuits over their role in the opioid epidemic have warned that settlement talks will be \u201cseverely\u201d jeopardized if plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are allowed to assess a fee payment worth billions of dollars.  Major distributors such as McKesson Corp and drugmakers including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd joined in the request that U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, Ohio, reject a request by a committee of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers for a 7% fee assessed against any settlements. They filed their brief late Wednesday.  The request could amount to $3.3 billion, based on a $48 billion settlement proposal disclosed in October that five companies have been negotiating with various state attorneys general.  The drug companies noted that the attorneys would receive more money from the settlement than even some of the states they represent. Dozens of state attorneys general also opposed the fee request.  The fee would be paid to the so-called plaintiffs executive committee that is litigating thousands of lawsuits by towns, counties and tribal governments that have been consolidated before Polster.  The lawsuits accuse the companies of fueling a nationwide opioid crisis that been blamed for 400,000 U.S. overdose deaths since 1999.  Many local governments hired private attorneys and will have to carve out of any money received for a separate legal fee, which in some cases will be paid to the same attorneys who sit on the plaintiffs executive committee, or PEC.  \u201cThe scope of that demand is staggering,\u201d the companies said in Wednesday\u2019s joint filing. They said the 7% assessment would \u201cgive the PEC more money than any city or county in the country, and more than many states.\u201d  Paul Hanly, a member of the PEC, did not respond to a request for comment.  In court filings, PEC lawyers described the fee request as \u201cmodest\u201d given the complex litigation. Such a fee, to compensate for lawyers\u2019 time and expenses, is a feature of complex nationwide litigation.  The fee request has also met opposition from state attorneys general, who brought their own opioid cases that are not before Polster.  In a letter to Polster on Monday, attorneys general from 36 states said plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers were wrongly seeking to tax any settlements the states achieve and that the fee request if approved could \u201cirreparably\u201d disrupt global settlement talks.  \u201cEveryone understands these attorneys have done a lot of work,\u201d New Hampshire Associate Attorney General James Boffetti said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean they get a disproportionate windfall.\u201d  The parties are under pressure to resolve the lawsuits before the start of a March 20 trial in New York.

J&J shares fell nearly 3 percent Monday, closing at $129.14 in New York Stock Exchange trading. That drop was on top of the 10 percent plunge that wiped out about $40 billion of the company's market capitalization following the Reuters report here Friday. J&J also announced Monday that it would be repurchasing up to $5 billion of its common stock.  Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, on Friday sent a letter to the head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration calling on the agency to investigate the findings in the Reuters report to determine whether J&J misled regulators and whether its Baby Powder products threaten public health and safety.  J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky, in his first interview since the Reuters article was published, was scheduled to appear on CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money\u201d with host Jim Cramer on Monday night. J&J knew for decades about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its products dating back to as early as 1971, a Reuters examination of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents showed. In response to the report, J&J said on Friday that \u201cany suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.\u201d  A Monday full-page ad from J&J -- headlined \u201cScience. Not sensationalism.\u201d -- ran in newspapers including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The ad asserted that J&J has scientific evidence its talc is safe and beneficial to use. \u201cIf we had any reasons to believe our talc was unsafe, it would be off our shelves,\u201d the ad said.  J&J rebutted Reuters\u2019 report in a lengthy written critique of the article and a video from Gorsky. In the written critique, posted on the company\u2019s website here, J&J said Reuters omitted information it supplied to the news organization that demonstrated the healthcare conglomerate\u2019s Baby Powder is safe and does not cause cancer; that J&J\u2019s baby powder has repeatedly been tested and found to be asbestos-free; and that the company has cooperated with the U.S. FDA and other regulators around the world to provide information requested over decades.  \u201cSince tests for asbestos in talc were first developed, J&J\u2019s Baby Powder has never contained asbestos,\u201d Gorsky said in the video here. He added that regulators \u201chave always found our talc to be asbestos-free.\u201d  A Reuters spokeswoman on Monday said the agency \u201cstands by its reporting.\u201d  Reuters\u2019 investigation found that while most tests in past decades found no asbestos in J&J talc and talc products, tests on Baby Powder conducted by scientists at Mount Sinai Medical Center in 1971 and Rutgers University in 1991, as well as by labs for plaintiffs in cancer lawsuits, found small amounts of asbestos. In 1972, a University of Minnesota scientist found what he called \u201cincontrovertible asbestos\u201d in a sample of Shower to Shower. Other tests by J&J\u2019s own contract labs and others periodically found small amounts of asbestos in talc from mines that supplied the mineral for Baby Powder and other cosmetic products into the early 2000s.  The company did not report to the FDA three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 that found asbestos in the company\u2019s talc.  The Reuters story drew no conclusions about whether talc itself causes ovarian cancer. Asbestos, however, is a carcinogen. The World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer has listed asbestos-contaminated talc as a carcinogen since 1987. Reuters also found that J&J tested only a fraction of the talc powder it sold. The company never adopted a method for increasing the sensitivity of its tests that was recommended to the company by consultants in 1973 and in a published report in a peer-review scientific journal in 1991.  The ad J&J ran in newspapers Monday also pointed to an online talc fact page the company created with \u201cindependent studies from leading universities, research from medical journals and third-party opinions.\u201d  That website has changed since early December, according to a Reuters review of online archives.  The website, for instance, no longer contains a section headlined \u201cConclusions from Global Authorities\u201d that as recently as Dec. 5 listed organizations including the U.S. FDA, the European Union and Health Canada as among entities that have \u201creviewed and analyzed all available data and concluded that the evidence is insufficient to link talc use to cancer.\u201d  On Dec. 14, the day Reuters published its report, that section of the website had been removed. It is not clear exactly when the online page changed.  The Canadian government released a draft report this month that found a \u201cconsistent and statistically significant positive association\u201d between talc exposure and ovarian cancer. The draft report also said that talc meets criteria to be deemed toxic.  A J&J spokeswoman said the company removed the website section after the Canadian government issued the draft report. \u201cWe chose to be conservative while that draft is under review,\u201d the spokeswoman said.  While J&J has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, the products contributed less than 0.5 percent of J&J\u2019s $76.5 billion in revenue last year.","527":"Feb 5 (Reuters) - The Biden administration said on Friday it was invoking the Defense Production Act to help Pfizer Inc ramp up COVID-19 vaccine production and that \u201cevery option\u201d was on the table to produce more Johnson & Johnson vaccine should it be authorized.

In August, J&J signed a $1 billion contract with the U.S. government to supply up to 100 million doses by mid-2021.  Approval for J&J\u2019s vaccine could help speed up the vaccination effort in the United States as it likely requires a single dose unlike the two currently approved vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, which are to be administered in two-dose series weeks apart.

Genmab, which specialises in the development of antibody therapeutics for cancer treatment, currently receives royalties from Janssen, a Johnson & Johnson company, for sales of its blockbuster Darzalex drug for treatment of multiple myeloma.  The Danish firm said late on Tuesday that a New York arbitration court will determine whether it is entitled to part of Janssen's royalty payments to Halozyme HALO.O which supplies the enzyme technology for Darzalex injections.  Janssen started reducing royalty payments to Genmab in the second quarter, the Danish firm said.  The arbitration will also decide the duration of Darzalex royalty payments to Genmab, whether they should expire around 2030, when most of the Genmab patents expire, or in 2035 when Janssen\u2019s patents for Darzalex injections expire.  Most analysts assume Genmab will receive royalty payments until 2035. If the arbitration court rules against Genmab on the duration of Darzalex royalties, it would reduce the biotech firm\u2019s market value by a quarter, according to analysts at Jefferies.  \u201cWhile Genmab intends to vigorously protect its rights under the agreement, the outcome of any arbitration proceeding, as well as its duration, is inherently uncertain,\u201d Genmab said.

Gorsky \u201cis not, as we have repeatedly told the Subcommittee, an expert in the stated subject of the hearing,\u201d Knewitz said. \u201cWe have respectfully declined the invitation for our CEO to testify.\u201d  Knewitz said that the composition of the hearing, which includes two experts who have testified for plaintiffs against J&J, also factored into the company\u2019s decision.  Gorsky has played a lead role in J&J\u2019s efforts to reassure consumers and investors that its talc powders are safe and asbestos free. Last year, he issued a statement vouching for the safety of the products after a jury issued a $4.69 billion verdict in favor of 22 women who sued over allegations their ovarian cancers were caused by J&J powders.  Gorsky appeared on CNBC's \"Mad Money with Jim Cramer\" and in a video posted on J&J's website to rebut a December 2018 Reuters report here that the company knew for decades about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its talc and powders.  \u201cSince tests for asbestos in talc were first developed, J&J\u2019s Baby Powder has never contained asbestos,\u201d Gorsky said in the video.  In October, Gorsky testified in a deposition here in a lawsuit filed by an Indiana man, saying, \"We unequivocally believe that our talc and our baby powder does not contain asbestos.\" J&J faces more than 16,000 similar lawsuits.  Concerns over asbestos in talc cosmetics have grown in recent months as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that the carcinogen had been found in several products, including a bottle of Baby Powder.  J&J said it recalled 33,000 bottles of Baby Powder \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d Later, J&J said labs it hired found no asbestos - other than some contamination it blamed on an air conditioner - in samples from the same Baby Powder bottle and its production lot.  The FDA has said it stands by its finding.  Chief executives of companies embroiled in controversies routinely comply with lawmakers\u2019 invitations to testify.  In recent months, the CEOs of Boeing BA.N and Facebook FB.O have appeared before congressional committees to answer questions about how their companies were safeguarding consumers.  Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said CEOs have a responsibility to go to Washington when Congress calls, just like other citizens.  But Elson said Gorsky\u2019s pass was understandable. He said the CEO and his advisers probably figured that the downside was greater to testifying than not.  \u201cIt\u2019s being invited in for a punch in the nose,\u201d Elson said. For Gorsky, \u201cnothing good will come out of it.\u201d","534":"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said on Friday it was offered about $2.1 billion for its LifeScan Inc unit, which makes blood glucose monitoring products, by private equity firm Platinum Equity, another step towards exiting the diabetes device market.  A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Platinum has given J&J until mid-June to accept the offer to allow for consultations with overseas workers.  Sales at J&J\u2019s diabetes device business, which also includes Animas Corp and Calibra Medical Inc, have been falling since 2012 in a highly competitive market and the company said last January that it was evaluating options for the units.  J&J said in October it would shut down Animas, which makes insulin pumps, after failing to find a buyer. J&J spokeswoman Donna Lorenson said the strategic review of the Calibra division, which sells wearable insulin pumps, is ongoing.  LifeScan, which has headquarters in Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania, and Zug, Switzerland, sells personal blood glucose meters, testing strips, and testing systems. More than 20 million people in 90 countries use its products.  Platinum Equity said in a press release that it is currently consulting with works councils that represent employees. The offer could be finalized by mid-June, unless it is extended, and a deal is anticipated to close by the end of 2018.  The company has 2,400 employees, largely in Europe, China and the United States, Lorenson said.  ANALYSTS SAY PRICE OK  The price for LifeScan, which generated revenue of about $1.5 billion in 2017, was disappointing but fair since the unit had weighed on J&J\u2019s growth for some time, Atlantic Equities analyst Steve Chesney said.  \u201cObviously expectations were for a higher valuation based on earlier reports, but probably closer to reality given the state of the business,\u201d Chesney said.  Reuters had reported in January that Chinese buyers were interested in paying $3 billion to $4 billion for the companies.  Cowen analyst Joshua Jennings said in a research note that the LifeScan valuation was reasonable given that the business was declining and facing continued pricing pressure.  J&J said it factored the transaction into the 2018 earnings forecast it gave in January.  J&J shares fell 0.4 percent, or 56 cents, to $132.50 in morning trading.","535":"NEW DELHI, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Indian drug inspectors have seized samples of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s baby powder from a plant in a northern state, an industry source said on Wednesday, following a Reuters report the company knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos lurked in the product.

Ethicon said it was reviewing the court\u2019s decision and would consider its options to appeal.  \u201cEthicon believes that the company acted ethically and responsibly in the research, development and supply of these products,\u201d the company said in a statement.

J&J said in a statement that it is currently in discussions with regulators and partners regarding the inclusion of the pediatric population in its trials.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it is important for drugmakers to test their vaccines in children.

Rival drugmaker Pfizer Inc has already begun testing the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Germany\u2019s BioNTech in children as young as 12. Their vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA), a new technology that has yet to produce an approved vaccine.  J&J\u2019s uses a cold virus to deliver coronavirus genetic material in order to spur an immune response. The platform - called AdVac - is used in a vaccine for Ebola that was approved in Europe earlier this year and used on more than 100,000 people, including infants, children, and pregnant women.

A Johnson & Johnson shareholder pushing for mandatory arbitration moved Tuesday to enjoin J&J\u2019s April 25 annual meeting, arguing that the company must allow investors to vote on a proposal that would require them to arbitrate their disputes with J&J. The preliminary injunction motion, filed in federal court in Trenton, New Jersey, will be, to the best of my knowledge, the first courtroom test of the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  The injunction motion, which follows a March 1 lawsuit against the company, was filed by the Doris Behr 2012 Irrevocable Trust. The trust, which is advised by Harvard law professor emeritus (and arbitration proponent) Hal Scott, wants the court to compel J&J to allow shareholders to vote on a proposed bylaw precluding securities class actions and directing investors to resolve claims in individual proceedings before the American Arbitration Association. (Yes, that\u2019s right: The trust, a shareholder, wants a bylaw that would end shareholder class actions.)  J&J, as I\u2019ll explain, opposes the bylaw. Its lawyers at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom didn\u2019t respond to my request for comment on the trust\u2019s preliminary injunction motion but said in a letter Wednesday to the judge overseeing the case that there\u2019s no need for urgency and that the trust\u2019s arguments are contrary to the weight of authority.  Scott and the trust first proposed a shareholder vote on mandatory arbitration last November. That proposal, as you may recall, led to a blowup at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Skadden lawyers informed the SEC in December that the company considered the proposal a violation of federal securities law. J&J, they said, intended to exclude the Behr trust\u2019s proposal from proxy materials and from a shareholder vote. The company asked the SEC\u2019s corporate finance division for reassurance that the commission would not bring an enforcement action against the company for blocking the proposed resolution.  In the past, the SEC has pushed back hard against shareholder arbitration, including 2012 proposals by shareholders at Gannett and Pfizer that presaged the Behr trust\u2019s J&J proposal. But some SEC commissioners have lately announced support for mandatory shareholder arbitration provisions and SEC chairman Jay Clayton has been notably non-committal on the issue. Arbitration opponents saw the trust\u2019s J&J proposal as a threat - and mobilized opposition.  The SEC ended up agreeing that J&J could block the proposal, relying mostly on a last-minute opinion from New Jersey\u2019s attorney general that said mandatory arbitration was illegal under state law. Notably, however, the SEC seemed to back away from its previous position that requiring shareholders to arbitrate would violate federal law \u2013 possibly in recognition of pro-arbitration rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013\u2019s American Express v. Italian Colors and 2018\u2019s Epic Systems v. Lewis.  That shift by the SEC, Scott told me Wednesday, was critical to the trust\u2019s decision to go to court to demand J&J put its arbitration proposal to a shareholder vote. By basing its decision on the New Jersey AG\u2019s view of New Jersey law, Scott said, the SEC left open the question of whether the AG\u2019s interpretation is correct \u2013 and failed entirely to address the trust\u2019s arguments that the Federal Arbitration Act preempts state law no matter what New Jersey has to say about mandatory shareholder arbitration.  The trust, which is represented in the new litigation against Johnson & Johnson by Jonathan Mitchell of Mitchell Law, lays out its case comprehensively in Tuesday\u2019s preliminary injunction brief, which seeks a declaration that J&J violated federal securities laws by excluding the trust\u2019s proposal and an injunction requiring J&J to announce in a supplemental proxy statement that mandatory shareholder arbitration is legal under state and federal law. J&J has already sent out proxy materials for the scheduled April 25 meeting, omitting mention of the Behr trust\u2019s proposal.  According to the trust\u2019s injunction brief, J&J bears the burden of proving its proposal is illegal and the company has been unable to identify any federal statute or New Jersey law or legal precedent that precludes mandatory shareholder arbitration. The trust argues that after the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Epic and Italian Colors, such provisions are permissible under federal law because nothing in the Securities and Exchange Act implies a partial repeal of the Federal Arbitration Act. (I\u2019m condensing a nuanced, multi-pronged argument but that\u2019s the gist.) The trust contends that the New Jersey AG erroneously based his conclusion about the state-law legality of mandatory arbitration on a recent Delaware ruling on forum selection in corporate charters \u2013 and even if the AG were correct in his interpretation, the FAA trumps state law.  \u201cThere is no need for this court to explore the contours of New Jersey law or engage in \u2026 guesses about what the New Jersey courts might do,\u201d the brief said. \u201cIf the law of New Jersey purports to prohibit a corporation and its shareholders from agreeing to arbitrate their disputes, then that law is preempted by the FAA.\u201d  In a letter filed Wednesday with U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp of Trenton, J&J counsel Andrew Muscato of Skadden said the trust has manufactured urgency after waiting weeks to file a complaint and injunction motion. \u201cConspicuously absent from the application is any attempt to demonstrate emergency circumstances,\u201d the letter said. \u201cPlaintiff did not file suit until March 21 \u2014 more than four and a half months after it knew Johnson & Johnson intended to exclude the proposal, almost six weeks after the SEC issued its no-action letter and eight days after the company filed (and mailed and\/or made available electronically) its proxy materials.\u201d  J&J also previewed the merits of its argument against mandatory shareholder arbitration. \u201c(The trust\u2019s) theory is built upon the notion that everyone else got it wrong,\u201d the company\u2019s letter said. \u201cIn actuality, (the trust) has no likelihood of success, as evidenced by the numerous authorities it dismisses as wrong, including the State of New Jersey\u2019s chief legal officer.\u201d  Muscato didn\u2019t respond to my email request for comment. Plaintiffs\u2019 advocacy groups will probably also want a say in this case. After the trust sued, the American Association of Justice and the Secure Our Savings coalition, which is led by Public Justice and the Consumer Federation of America, issued statements warning that the mandatory arbitration provisions the Behr trust is advocating will make it easier for corporations to defraud investors. \u201cWe will continue to oppose this effort and any others that aim to shield unscrupulous corporations from accountability by hiding behind forced arbitration clauses,\u201d the AAJ statement said.  Trust lawyer Scott told me he just wants to give J&J shareholders a chance to vote on mandatory arbitration. \u201cI believe it\u2019s they who should make the decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to give them a choice.\u201d","541":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A woman who claimed her cancer was caused by using Johnson & Johnson\u2019s baby powder for decades said she believes justice was served after a jury found the company should pay her and 21 other women $4.69 billion in damages.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  A St. Louis jury on July 12 concluded that J&J\u2019s talc-based products contained asbestos, causing the 22 women, six of whom have died, to develop ovarian cancer.  J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky earlier this week expressed confidence that the jury decision will be overturned on appeal.  \u201cJustice has been served\u201d regardless of the ultimate outcome, Toni Roberts, 62, told Reuters in a telephone interview.  \u201cWe have made a difference. We have alerted the public,\u201d said Roberts of Philadelphia, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2014.  New Jersey-based J&J, which is battling some 9,000 talc product liability cases, has consistently denied that the products cause cancer and says they never contained asbestos. The St. Louis trial was the first to allege asbestos-contaminated talc caused ovarian cancer.  J&J has successfully overturned prior verdicts in the talc litigation.  A company lawyer told Reuters J&J would argue on appeal that the case was based on flawed science, and that it should not have been heard in Missouri because many of the defendants were from out-of-state. A 2017 U.S. Supreme Court decision severely restricted state courts\u2019 jurisdiction over injury lawsuits brought by non-residents against out-of-state companies.  One of the women in the Missouri case, Krystal Kim, from West Chester, Pennsylvania, told Reuters she had been using J&J baby powder several times a day since she was 10. The now 53-year-old Kim said she put the powder on bed sheets, carpets, her hair, face and body and even on her dog.  Kim said she put her faith in the brand because of its promise of purity. \u201cThey call it baby powder to make it seem innocuous,\u201d she said.  Kim and Roberts said J&J should take its talc-based powder off the market or add a warning label.  J&J has said those steps were unnecessary, citing scientific tests concluding talc does not cause cancer or contain asbestos.  During the trial, the company\u2019s lawyer, Peter Bicks, said J&J had deep compassion for the women, but that the company was not to blame for their diseases.  \u201cJust because something terrible happened doesn\u2019t mean that Johnson & Johnson had anything to do with it,\u201d Bicks said.","542":"A drug wholesaler is urging a federal appeals court to not send a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson of seeking to suppress competition for its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade to arbitration.

The case of Bertila Boyd-Bostic, who died of a rare form of cancer in 2017 at the age of 30, is the latest in a series of trials in the United States that center around allegations that the company\u2019s talc-based powder contained asbestos.  J&J said that its widely-used baby powder never contained asbestos or causes cancer and denies the accusations, citing decades of testing by independent laboratories and scientists.  Asbestos is a known carcinogen linked to mesothelioma, the type of cancer Boyd-Bostic had been diagnosed with at the age of 29.  After two weeks of trial, the jury in the Darlington County Court of Common Pleas said it could not decide whether J&J was responsible for the disease. Under South Carolina law, a jury has to make a unanimous decision.  J&J did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Christopher Swett, a lawyer for the family of Boyd-Bostic, said in a statement that the plaintiffs would retry the case at the earliest opportunity.  \u201cWe continue to believe that the daily use of baby powder on Bertila from birth led to her death,\u201d Swett said.  The case also named as a defendant the U.S. unit of talc supplier Imerys SA, as well as a local unit of Rite Aid, one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, which allegedly sold the baby powder used by the woman.  Imerys Talc America and Rite Aid did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  J&J is battling some 9,000 cases claiming its talc products cause ovarian cancer, but litigants have recently focused on claims based on alleged asbestos contamination.  A California jury on Thursday awarded $25.7 million in damages to a woman and her husband over allegations that the company\u2019s baby powder had caused her mesothelioma.  A New Jersey court jury in April ordered J&J and Imerys Talc America to pay $117 million to a man who alleged he developed mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure from talc-based products.

The company says the story is an \u201cabsurd conspiracy theory\u201d as \u201cevery method available to test J&J\u2019s talc for asbestos has been used by J&J, regulators, or independent experts, and all of these methods have all found that our cosmetic talc is asbestos-free.\u201d If history is a guide the market may have over-reacted, but lawsuits and brand damage don\u2019t easily dissipate.  J&J faces thousands of lawsuits from users that claim the company\u2019s talc resulted in health problems. In July, a jury in Missouri ordered the company to pay $4.7 billion to 22 women who claimed their ovarian cancer was caused by asbestos in J&J\u2019s products. The market had shrugged off that decision. The company\u2019s stock by Thursday had risen nearly 5 percent since January, giving it a market capitalization of almost $400 billion.  Lopping off 10 percent of that may be an overreaction. Investors tend to panic when multibillion-dollar settlements become likely. Drugmaker Merck lost $27 billion, or 27 percent of its market value, when it pulled painkiller Vioxx in 2004 after studies linked it to heart attacks and strokes. The company ended up settling most cases for under $5 billion. Likewise, investors have discounted a $15 billion liability at Bayer for lawsuits that claim a weedkiller made by Monsanto, the U.S. company it acquired this year, caused cancer, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The bank believes the payout will probably be somewhere below $5 billion.  The legal bills won\u2019t abate anytime soon. Merck was still dealing with Vioxx-related litigation more than a decade after the drug was pulled from the market. But the hit to J&J\u2019s reputation may be the most difficult to fix. In the 1980s, seven people died after taking Tylenol painkillers that had been laced with cyanide. The company\u2019s response to that tragedy \u2013 recalling 31 million bottles, taking out advertisements warning customers, and introducing tamper-proof packaging \u2013 became a staple business-school lesson in reputation-buffing.

FILE PHOTO: Bottles of Johnson & Johnson baby powder line a drugstore shelf in New York October 15, 2015. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  J&J has been battling some 6,000 cases claiming its baby powder and Shower to Shower products cause ovarian cancer. The $117 million verdict by a New Jersey jury last week, however, involved a different form of cancer that is clearly linked to asbestos.  Plaintiffs lawyers claim that internal J&J documents seen in that trial show that baby powder had been contaminated with asbestos. They now plan to use the documents in upcoming ovarian cancer trials to allege that the asbestos contamination also caused that form of cancer.  J&J and Imerys Talc America, a unit of Imerys SA, have vowed to appeal the New Jersey verdict and deny asbestos has ever been present in their products or that their talc can cause any form of cancer.  The case of Stephen Lanzo, a New Jersey resident who claimed he developed mesothelioma after using baby powder since his birth in 1972, was the first time a jury saw the internal J&J documents which plaintiffs claim show that J&J knew since the 1970s that the talc in its baby powder was contaminated by asbestos during the mining process.  J&J says the documents present no such evidence, but merely show the company\u2019s caution.  Peter Bicks, a lawyer leading J&J\u2019s talc asbestos defense, said that in the early 1970s, the company was looking at how it could potentially remove asbestos from talc if the two became intermingled in the mining process. He says no contamination was ever found, citing decades of testing by independent laboratories and scientists.  Bicks called the claims of a link between talc and asbestos \u201cjunk science.\u201d  Mesothelioma, a rare and deadly form of cancer closely associated with exposure to asbestos, affects the delicate tissue that lines body cavities.  While the link between asbestos and mesothelioma is sufficiently established, scientists are divided on whether asbestos exposure can cause ovarian cancer. Some studies have shown an association between the two, while other studies have found no such link.  Elizabeth Burch, holder of the Charles H. Kirbo Chair of Law at the University of Georgia, said it remained an open question whether talc contained asbestos and that each case would turn on the facts.  But J&J, which had $76.5 billion in sales in 2017, gives the plaintiffs\u2019 bar an enticing new target, said Nathan Schachtman, a lecturer at Columbia University who used to defend asbestos cases.  Some 3,000 people are diagnosed with mesothelioma each year, according to the American Cancer Society, a number that Howard Erichson, a law professor at Fordham University who specializes in mass tort litigation, called significant from a legal standpoint.  But the roughly 22,000 women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer last year, according to the National Cancer Institute, provide lawyers with a potentially much larger pool of plaintiffs to tap.  \u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Mark Lanier, one of the lawyers representing consumers, who said plaintiffs would file thousands of additional mesothelioma and ovarian cancer cases.  New Jersey-based J&J in a statement after the Lanzo verdict said plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys had shifted their strategy to focus on asbestos after a series of losses at trial and in court rulings over previous allegations that the talc itself causes cancer.  Of the six ovarian cancer trials to date, juries found J&J liable five times, but a Missouri appellate court threw out the first verdict and a California judge tossed another. Appeals of the other cases are pending.  J&J in November also won the first trial over allegations that its talc contained asbestos and caused a woman\u2019s mesothelioma. Plaintiffs lawyers say the jury in that case did not see the documents presented during the Lanzo trial.  But Erichson said the widespread use of J&J\u2019s consumer products generally make the company an attractive litigation target.  \u201cBaby powder is as ubiquitous a product you can think of and there are lots of people who can testify they\u2019ve been exposed to it,\u201d he said.","572":"LONDON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - The UK government has sealed two more deals to secure COVID-19 vaccines, buying shots in development from U.S. drugmakers Johnson & Johnson and Novavax Inc, the chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce Katie Bingham told Sky News on Friday.

Both were in the St. Louis\u2019 22nd Circuit Court, which has issued several large verdicts against J&J and Imerys, including one for $4.7 billion in July.  The vast majority of the plaintiffs in the St. Louis cases are from other states, and the defendants have repeatedly challenged their right to sue in Missouri as opposed to their home states or in states where the companies are headquartered or have a substantial presence. J&J is based in New Jersey and Imerys, a unit of Imerys SA, is based in California.  In the case stayed on Thursday, which had been scheduled to go to trial on April 8, only two of the 24 plaintiffs were from Missouri.  The plaintiffs claim asbestos in Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products caused their cancer, alleging that J&J and Imerys knew of asbestos contamination since at least the 1970s, but failed to warn consumers.  Reuters on Dec. 14 published a Special Report detailing that the company knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for cancer-causing asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results the company did not disclose to regulators or consumers.

Mark Lanier, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer in the case stayed on Thursday, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He also represented the plaintiffs in the $4.7 billion case, most of whom were also from outside Missouri.  J&J, which is a co-defendant with Imerys, said it had also asked to postpone the upcoming trial and its petition remained pending. The company declined comment on Thursday.  The Missouri Supreme Court previously stayed a talc case against J&J and Imerys that was due to begin on Jan. 21 on the same jurisdictional grounds.  A number of multi-million-dollar talc verdicts against J&J and Imerys in the St. Louis court have been thrown out following a 2017 U.S. Supreme Court decision limiting state courts\u2019 jurisdiction over claims by non-residents against out-of-state companies.  However, the St. Louis trial court has allowed many out-of-state plaintiffs, including most of those who won the $4.7 billion verdict, to proceed based on state ties the defendants say are tenuous.

A senior EU official, who is involved in negotiations with vaccine makers and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the J&J shot could be available from April 1 in Europe.  Earlier on Wednesday, an EU lawmaker said J&J could seek EU approval for its one-shot vaccine in February.  \u201cEU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides announced during our (EU lawmakers) group meeting this morning that the vaccine manufacturer Johnson & Johnson is likely to submit an application for approval to the EU for their vaccine in February,\u201d said Peter Liese, who speaks on health matters for the EU\u2019s centre-right group, the assembly\u2019s largest.

J&J Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Paul Stoffels told Reuters the drugmaker expects to have clear data on how effective its vaccine is by the end of this month or early February and was on track for a U.S. rollout in March.  The EU drugs regulator had said in December it expected the J&J to apply in the first quarter of this year.  It took EMA 20 days to approve the vaccine developed by BioNTech SE and Pfizer Inc, and just over a month to authorise the Moderna Inc shot after their applications were submitted in early December.

An Apple Store employee shows the new Series 5 Apple Watch during the preview of the redesigned and reimagined Apple Fifth Avenue store in New York, U.S., September 19, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid -  Last year, Apple's Heart Study here found that the watch could accurately detect atrial fibrillation, the most common type of irregular heartbeat, according to a study that explored the role of wearable devices in identifying potential heart problems. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke more than fivefold, according to the American Heart Association.  Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, said the initial study proved the Apple Watch can detect atrial fibrillation with a low rate of false alarms, which helped Apple gain clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a watch app that takes an electrocardiogram, or EKG, measurement. The study with J&J aims to show if early detection leads to better health outcomes.  \u201cWe want to follow the science all the way to the end, no matter what the outcomes are, and run this longitudinal study,\u201d Williams told Reuters in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we have to do, but it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d  The joint effort, called \u201cHeartline,\u201d is significant because J&J is one of the world\u2019s largest medical device makers and pharmaceutical companies.  \u201cWhat we bring is clinical study capability on a very large scale,\u201d said Paul Stoffels, J&J\u2019s chief scientific officer, who said the study aims to track 150,000 participants with long-term follow-ups over two years.  The study could also reach a different population than Apple\u2019s original heart study, which included 400,000 participants but faced questions from medical experts because more than half of the people who signed up were under 40, a group already at low risk for atrial fibrillation.  J&J targeted the study at population with a higher risk. Paul Burton, vice president of medical affairs at the J&J subsidiary running the study, said 70% of patients experiencing the condition are over 65.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do here is definitively answer that question: If you take wearable technology and couple it with an app, can you reduce the risk of a stroke or death?\u201d Burton said.  The J&J study will be open to the more than 40 million people enrolled in traditional Medicare plans, which cover people aged 65 and older as well as the disabled. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either use only an iPhone app or use the app in conjunction with a watch capable of taking an EKG.  If patients who enroll are assigned to the arm of the study using the Apple Watch, they will be prompted to acquire one of the devices, which study officials said the participants can either purchase on their own for personal use for $49 or borrow free of charge for the study.  The latest Apple Watch model starts at list price of $399. Burton said J&J and Apple were sharing the cost of subsidizing the watches.  The study will pay participants, who must agree to share their Medicare claims data. Apple and J&J officials said that was key to proving whether the use of the app and watch lead to reduced stroke risk.  \u201cWith tens of millions of watches on people\u2019s wrists and us delivering this early detection, we have a huge responsibility to make sure that early detection is effective and really helping people with their health in the long haul,\u201d Apple\u2019s Williams told Reuters.","588":"April 30 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson:  * J&J SAYS AT MEETING, SHAREHOLDERS ELECTED ALL 11 DIRECTOR NOMINEES NAMED IN 2018 PROXY STATEMENT TO CO'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS - SEC FILING Source text: (bit.ly\/2HF5zyu) Further company coverage:","589":"July 15 (Reuters) - Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general is expected on Monday to urge a judge to find Johnson & Johnson responsible for flooding the market with painkillers and fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic, as the first trial in nationwide litigation over the drug crisis comes to an end.  Lawyers for Attorney General Mike Hunter and J&J are set to deliver closing arguments in state court in Norman, Oklahoma following six weeks of testimony from current and former J&J executives and victims of the epidemic.  The case is one of more than 2,000 actions by state and local governments accusing drug manufacturers of contributing to an epidemic linked to a record 47,600 opioid overdose deaths in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The Oklahoma case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in other opioid lawsuits, particularly in 1,900 cases pending in Ohio brought largely by cities and counties against J&J and other companies.  The federal judge overseeing that litigation has been pushing for a settlement ahead of an October trial.  Oklahoma says that starting in the 1990s, New Jersey-based J&J used misleading marketing to push doctors to prescribe more opioids.  The state claims that J&J, which sold the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, marketed the opioids as \u201csafe and effective for everyday pain\u201d and downplayed their addictive qualities.  The state has accused J&J of acting as the \u201ckingpin\u201d behind the epidemic and says it was motivated to boost prescriptions not only because it sold painkillers but because it also grew and imported raw materials opioid manufacturers like OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP used.  J&J denies the allegations. Its lawyers have argued that its products made up a small share of opioids prescribed in Oklahoma and carried U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved labels that warned of the addictive risks.  The company says the state lacks evidence linking J&J\u2019s marketing to doctors writing unwarranted opioid prescriptions or that it caused the epidemic.  The company also has said that the state is seeking to stretch the bounds of a public nuisance statute in order to force J&J to pay up to $17.5 billion to remedy the crisis.  Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman, who will hear the arguments, will rule at a later date.  Purdue and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd were originally also defendants in the case. Purdue reached a $270 million settlement with the state in March and Teva settled for $85 million in June. Both deny wrongdoing.

The settlement with Actelion Pharmaceuticals US Inc, which became a subsidiary of J&J after the pharmaceutical giant acquired the biotech company in 2017, was the largest so far to result from an industry-wide probe into drugmakers\u2019 support of patient assistance charities.  The investigation, led by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts, has led to allegations that several drugmakers used these charitable foundations as a means to pay Medicare patients\u2019 co-pays in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.  Actelion did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement. New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in the Medicare government healthcare program for the elderly. But companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent.  Amid increased attention to rising drug prices in the United States, concern has arisen that donations from drugmakers to patient-assistance groups may be contributing to price inflation.  Thursday\u2019s settlement surpassed the largest accord previously announced by the Department of Justice - an agreement by United Therapeutics Corp in December 2017 to pay $210 million to resolve claims it improperly used a charity to cover co-payments.  Pfizer Inc in May resolved similar allegations for nearly $23.85 million. Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc and Lundbeck earlier this year disclosed they had reached agreements to resolve similar claims for $57 million and $52.6 million, respectively.
