2021-02-16,"60 in no time buy while it’s good"
2021-02-16,"I like Ko at 50, gives me time to buy more :D"
2021-02-16,"KO family- this is no longer a growth company, accept the cash cow and move on! Otherwise, watch the iceberg melt with systemic inefficient capabilities of bloated management who continue to believe otherwise. Just look at the 2020 failed vision. All this from a huge beneficiary of this once great growth story."
2021-02-16,"This will trade at $85 in 5 years. Just collect dividends."
2021-02-16,"Slow and steady wins the race. KO is the king of slow and steady. I'm in for 300 shares forever."
2021-02-16,"great reopening trade IMO. something like 40-50% of their sales is restaurants, theme parks, concerts etc.. OT - Apha good buy right now too, with merger coming"
2021-02-15,"Back to 60"
2021-02-14,"I think we will see a dividend increase announcement Thursday."
2021-02-13,"Steady and slowly. This stock is a keeper"
2021-02-12,"wow!!!.last time I was here it was maybe 1 year ago!.Is this stock like a savings account??? Man this dog hasn't move in 20 something years! while other stocks are thousands of percentages up in just a few weeks!!!!"
2021-02-12,"I feel $KO is a great staple stock to have in your portfolio. It won’t get you rich but if you play the long game It will definitely be rewarding."
2021-02-11,"You guys aren't going to win this case against the IRS. $12 billion tax bill and you guys only have $10 billion in cash. Wouldn't be surprised if this dividend gets whacked for awhile."
2021-02-11,"Unbelievably reliable stock"
2021-02-11,"WON'T BE HAPPY UNTIL $60.13 RETURNS. PERIOD!"
2021-02-11,"In 4 weeks ex dividend i would not be surprised this stock climbing slowly towards $ 55, i feel confident i having them ."
2021-02-11,"Good volume today. Solid Rally. Nice beat on earnings. I suspected as much with the 4th quarter. (The Holidays). Revenue missed but that was to be expected. Restructuring of product line is helping their bottom line. Looking forward to dividend call. Would be shocked if over .42 a share. When the market corrects, KO will take a hit. That would be the time to cost average and hold. The 1 problem I have with KO is pretty much everything is riding on the squeaky clean brand name. If the brand takes a big hit ( tampering, recalls ect) This stock will dive faster than...."
2021-02-11,"An extremely wasteful company with little knowledge of how to utilise their physical assets... Could have so much more potential if they would slash their management, sales team, and advertising and focus primarily on manufacturing and distribution."
2021-02-11,"just buy $KO"
2021-02-11,"Gross margins are down, revenues are down and there is problem with IRS that goes back years and into billions of dollars. So, I wonder how this one is even staying about $44."
2021-02-11,"I was hoping to pick up some today if it went down a buck or so into $48 to start building a position, but it has jumped rather irrationally against the market. So I guess the well off is just temporary after an 11 day rally in the stocks."
2021-02-11,"Ok, but if bonds will fall dividend stock will fall too. The valuation on this one and a few other dividend stocks is based of low interest rates and money will soon flight to safe places. You have to see the products demand also. They said that only Latin America showed growth rest was a set back. So I wonder what you all make of it?"
2021-02-11,"60.13 KO before Pandemic...still holding...we’ll get there again one day"
