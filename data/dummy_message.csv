REUTERS/Lee Smith/File Photo  LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon brought a little cheer to Britain鈥檚 pandemic- battered labour market on Friday, saying it will recruit more than 1,000 apprentices in 2021.  Britain鈥檚 unemployment rate hit 5% in November, its highest since mid-2016, according to official data.  The retail sector has been particularly badly hit by the coronavirus crisis. According to the Centre for Retail Research, the sector lost 177,000 jobs in 2020, with a further 200,000 expected to be shed this year.  Amazon said the apprenticeships will cover 25 different programmes ranging from IT, safety technician and human resources through to robotics, software engineering and creative digital design.  The U.S. internet giant said it created 10,000 permanent UK jobs in 2020, taking the total to over 40,000.  Amazon says it has invested 23 billion pounds ($31.5 billion) in the United Kingdom since 2010 but does not break down that figure between capital expenditure and operating costs.  On Tuesday, Amazon reported group quarterly sales above $100 billion for the first time and said founder Jeff Bezos was stepping down as CEO.  ($1 = 0.7301 pounds)"
2021/2/5,"(Fixes typo in bullet point)  * Amazon is rolling out AI-enabled surveillance cameras in its delivery vans  * Drivers and privacy advocates say the company is building a massive mobile surveillance system  * Although the system is billed to improve driver safety, some worry it is more about exerting control  By Avi Asher-Schapiro  BERLIN, Feb 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Amazon.com Inc’s announcement this week that it would be rolling out AI-powered cameras in its branded delivery vans for safety has drawn criticism from privacy advocates and workers concerned with being subjected to surveillance on the job.  The world’s largest e-commerce firm said the cameras, which are developed by transportation technology company Netradyne, would improve safety of both drivers and the communities in which they deliver.  But employees like Henry Search, a 22-year-old delivery driver in Washington state, said they saw cameras capturing their work day as an “invasion of privacy”.  “We are out here working all day, trying our best already,” Search told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. “The cameras are just another way to control us.”  Privacy advocates warned that equipping Amazon’s fleet of about 30,000 delivery vehicles with AI cameras could set a dangerous precedent for privacy.  “This appears to be the largest expansion of corporate surveillance in human history,” said Evan Greer, deputy director of tech nonprofit Fight for the Future. “If this becomes the norm, we are talking about the extinction of human privacy.”  Amazon has come under scrutiny in the past for accidents involving delivery drivers.  A company spokeswoman said in emailed comments that “this technology will provide drivers real-time alerts to help them stay safe when they are on the road.”  In an instructional video about the cameras, Amazon’s senior manager for last-mile safety Karolina Haraldsdottir said cameras will record 100% of the time, but are not set up to livestream from inside of vans.  They will detect unsafe driving, including when drivers appear distracted or drowsy, she explained, adding that the footage could be used by the company’s safety team, or in investigations of theft or accidents.  But Greer said that safety issues could be addressed by slowing the pace of work. “The first thing they (Amazon) should do to improve safety would be not have such outrageous delivery quotas that force people into unsafe conditions,” she said.  Another driver in Massachusetts, who asked not to use his name to protect his identity, said he would welcome a camera displayed outside his van to record evidence for any accident.  “But a camera on my face all the time, I don’t see how that keeps me safe - it’s too much,” he said in a phone interview, noting that drivers already use an app called Mentor that tracks the location and movements of the vehicle.  DATA USE  Haraldsdottir said that “only a limited set of authorized people” would have access to driver footage from the cameras.  But some drivers worried Amazon might sell or share the footage with third parties, or use the cameras to monitor their performance on the job.  “The footage recorded could be shared with a future possible employer who can then decide to reject you before even knowing you,” said one driver from Michigan who asked not to give his full name.  Although he enjoys doing deliveries for Amazon, he said he is currently looking for other work because he does not want to be subjected to surveillance.  Rights activists say Amazon already has an extensive surveillance system in its warehouses to track workers’ movements and boost productivity, including navigation software, item scanners, wristbands, thermal cameras and recorded footage.  “There are no laws in place to meaningfully limit what Amazon can do with the footage they collect,” said Greer, noting that other surveillance products, such as the Ring doorbell camera system, can share footage with police departments.  ‘DYSTOPIA PRIME’  Surveillance experts say that the privacy implications of Amazon’s camera network for delivery vans extend far beyond drivers.  Andrew Ferguson, a professor of law at D.C.’s American University, said Amazon’s private surveillance networks would further entrench the snooping powers of government.  “While the inclination to use AI technology to enhance driver safety is commendable, the failure to think about the privacy and surveillance issues and equities is troubling,” he said.  While police may not have direct access to the footage, authorities will be able to access it in the course of an investigation, expanding the reach of police surveillance, Ferguson explained.  Last June, Amazon announced a one-year moratorium on police use of its facial recognition software, following criticism that the technology reinforced racial bias.  “Amazon is quite literally building mobile surveillance vans to film our neighborhoods, something that we would be rightly horrified about if our government did it,” Ferguson said. “I don’t think we want to join dystopia prime.”"
2021/2/5,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has ordered hundreds of trucks that run on compressed natural gas as it tests ways to shift its U.S. fleet away from heavier polluting trucks, the company told Reuters on Friday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The coronavirus pandemic caused delivery activity to surge in 2020, with truck volumes exceeding 2019 levels on average while passenger car traffic fell. But that increase in road activity means more pollution, as heavier-duty trucks emit higher levels of greenhouse gases than passenger vehicles.  Transportation companies are building their stable of electric vehicles to reduce carbon emissions. Much of the nation鈥檚 freight is delivered via medium- and heavy-duty trucks, which account for more than 20% of the industry鈥檚 greenhouse gas emissions even though they make up less than 5% of the road fleet, according to U.S. federal data.  鈥淎mazon is excited about introducing new sustainable solutions for freight transportation and is working on testing a number of new vehicle types including electric, CNG and others,鈥?the company said in a statement.  Amazon has ordered more than 700 compressed natural gas class 6 and class 8 trucks so far, according to the company.  The online retailer鈥檚 sales rose 38% in 2020; it plans to run a carbon neutral business by 2040.  The engines, supplied by a joint venture between Cummins Inc and Vancouver-based Westport Fuel Systems Inc, are to be used for Amazon鈥檚 heavy duty trucks that run from warehouses to distribution centers. More than 1,000 engines that can operate on both renewable and non-renewable natural gas have been ordered by the supplier, according to a source familiar with the situation.  Natural gas emits approximately 27% less carbon dioxide when burned compared with diesel fuel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Electric-powered motors are considered less viable for heavy-duty trucks than for the average passenger vehicle.  In 2019, Amazon ordered 100,000 electric vans from startup Rivian Automotive LLC. The first of those vans, to be used for last-mile delivery to customers, are to be delivered this year. The company also ordered 1,800 electric vans from Mercedes-Benz for its European delivery fleet.  Other transportation companies are also experimenting with ways to reduce emissions.  In 2019, United Parcel Service Inc announced plans to buy more than 6,000 natural gas-powered trucks over three years and step up purchases of renewable natural gas (RNG) as part of a $450 million investment to reduce the environmental impact of its 123,000-vehicle fleet.  RNG and natural gas from fossil fuel are both methane gases and can be used interchangeably. RNG is derived from decomposing organic matter such as cow manure on dairy farms, discarded food in landfills and human waste in water treatment plants. It also prevents naturally occurring methane - a powerful greenhouse gas - from being released into the environment.  Amazon shares were down 0.1% in post-close trading. Shares of Cummins rose 4%, while the U.S.-listed shares of Canada-based Westport surged, gaining 47% in the aftermarket session."
2021/2/5,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday dismissed nearly all of a lawsuit accusing upscale grocery chain Whole Foods Market of illegally punishing workers who wore Black Lives Matter face masks on the job.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Twenty-seven plaintiffs had accused Whole Foods in a proposed nationwide class action filed in Boston of selectively enforcing its dress code banning 鈥渧isible slogans, messages, logos or advertising鈥?unrelated to the company.  The plaintiffs said Whole Foods would send workers home without pay or impose disciplinary actions for wearing the masks and related apparel, even as it let employees wear masks bearing political messages and sports team logos.  U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs, however, said Whole Foods and its parent, Amazon.com Inc, did not engage in racial discrimination or violate Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964.  鈥淎t worst, they were selectively enforcing a dress code to suppress certain speech in the workplace,鈥?she wrote. 鈥淗owever unappealing that might be, it is not conduct made unlawful by Title VII.鈥? Burroughs said one plaintiff can pursue a retaliation claim.  The plaintiffs鈥?lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan expects her clients to appeal, saying in an email the decision 鈥済oes against the tide of case law recognizing the critical importance of eradicating race discrimination from worksites across our country.鈥? Whole Foods has said its dress code was 鈥渇acially neutral鈥?and that it has 鈥渮ero tolerance鈥?for retaliation. It has also along with Amazon expressed support for Black Lives Matter.  鈥淲e remain dedicated to ensuring our team members feel safe and free from discrimination and retaliation,鈥?a spokesman said following Burroughs鈥?decision.  The judge said employees who are not happy with the policy could try to persuade Whole Foods to change it, express themselves outside the workplace and perhaps encourage consumers to shop elsewhere, or find somewhere else to work.  A video showing the death last May 25 of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police sparked nationwide protests about racial injustice, including the treatment of Blacks in police custody.  The case is Frith et al v Whole Foods Market Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 20-11358."

2021/2/4,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House and the labor leaders connected with the Retail, Wholesale & Department Store Union have discussed the group鈥檚 effort to unionize an Amazon.com Inc facility in Alabama, an RWDSU official said on Wednesday.  Amazon, America鈥檚 second-biggest private employer behind Walmart Inc, does not have any union labor in the United States, and workers at its fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama, would be the first to join if they vote in favour.  The last attempt by Amazon workers to unionize was in 2014.  A White House spokeswoman, who declined to comment directly on the Alabama effort, said President Biden supports union organizing and collective bargaining and has urged employers not to run anti-union campaigns or interfere with organizing and bargaining. He has also called for holding employers accountable and increasing penalties when they do, she added.  RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum told Reuters the conversation with a top advisor to President Joe Biden took place after the inauguration and focused on their efforts to organize the facility in Alabama.  鈥淲e wanted to inform the White House that this campaign was taking place and that they would be hearing about it... we did not make any specific request,鈥?Appelbaum said, adding that the Biden advisor was interested in learning more about the situation in Alabama.  Appelbaum said labor leaders 鈥渃onnected to the RWDSU鈥?spoke to the White House, but he declined to name who they spoke with. He also said another senior advisor to Biden has been tracking the Alabama effort.  鈥淭he larger labor movement has indicated to the White House that this is an important campaign, that this is a priority,鈥?Appelbaum said.  On Feb. 8, the National Labor Relations Board will mail ballots to 5,805 workers at the facility near Birmingham, who will then have seven weeks to decide whether they want the RWDSU to represent them.  The effort to secure White House support by labor leaders underscores the high stakes involved, as Amazon fights its biggest labor battle yet in the United States. A victory for the union could encourage workers attempting to organize at other Amazon facilities.  Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said the company does not 鈥渂elieve the RWDSU represents the majority of our employees鈥?views.鈥?The company鈥檚 employees choose to work at Amazon because 鈥渨e offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire, and we encourage anyone to compare our total compensation package, health benefits, and workplace environment to any other company with similar jobs,鈥?she added.  Amazon has long avoided unionization, and it has trained managers to spot organizing activity. A website advocating Amazon workers shun unions, doitwithoutdues.com, warned the Bessemer employees, 鈥渨hy pay almost $500 in dues? We鈥檝e got you covered* with high wages, health care, vision, and dental benefits.鈥? The COVID pandemic spurred labor organizing in different parts of the company and the world鈥檚 largest online retailer has faced a barrage of criticism over its handling of a coronavirus outbreak at its warehouses and other facilities.  Amazon, reporting more than 19,000 COVID-19 cases as of September, has said it increased cleaning, implemented virus tests and temperature checks, and added other measures to protect associates."

2021/2/3,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - If India鈥檚 Future Group cannot sell assets, $4 billion in bank loans and debentures will be at risk, pushing its retail unit into insolvency, the company said in a court filing on Wednesday against Amazon.com Inc, which wants to block the sale.  FILE PHOTO: Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar  A court in New Delhi blocked Future Group鈥檚 sale of retail assets to Reliance Industries on Tuesday after Amazon raised objections to the deal.  The corporate battle has embroiled sprawling businesses led by two of the world鈥檚 richest men: Amazon鈥檚 Jeff Bezos and Reliance鈥檚 Mukesh Ambani.  Amazon had argued that Future breached contracts by selling retail assets to Reliance. The court sided with the U.S. firm, saying an earlier order from an arbitrator that put the Future-Reliance deal on hold was valid.  Future - which had argued the arbitrator鈥檚 order was not binding - on Wednesday filed a challenge against the court鈥檚 ruling, saying the company鈥檚 creditors would be at 鈥渟ignificant risk鈥?if the Reliance deal fails.  Other than an estimated 300 billion rupees ($4.1 billion) hit to bank loans and debentures, the deal鈥檚 failure would also impact livelihoods of 50,000 employees and 6,000 small- and medium-sized vendors, it said.  鈥淚t is inevitable that FRL (Future Retail) will go into liquidation ... The magnitude of damage that may be caused to the public at large is unimaginable,鈥?Future said the court filing, seen by Reuters.  The appeal is set to be heard on Thursday before a bigger two-judge bench in New Delhi.  Future, India鈥檚 second-largest retailer with more than 1,700 stores, and Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.  Shares of Future Retail dropped 5% in early trading on Wednesday. Reliance Industries fell as much as 1.2%, but recovered later.  The Delhi court on Tuesday asked Indian authorities to maintain status quo on the transaction, effectively putting the Future-Reliance deal on hold.  Indian stock exchanges and the country鈥檚 antitrust watchdog had already cleared the deal, though it was awaiting approval from a law tribunal.  Future in its appeal said Tuesday鈥檚 Delhi court order 鈥渞endered stillborn鈥?the approvals.  鈥淭he sole and sheer intent鈥?of Amazon was to prevent Reliance - which is also venturing into e-commerce - from acquiring Future鈥檚 assets, the Indian firm argued in the filing.  Amazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of Future鈥檚 retail assets itself, has argued a 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling them to anyone on a 鈥渞estricted persons鈥?list, including Reliance."
2021/2/3,"(Reuters) - Jeff Bezos鈥?surprise move to step down as chief executive of Amazon.com Inc quashed Wall Street optimism about bumper quarterly results, but analysts were upbeat on the promotion of its cloud computing head to the top job.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Andy Jassy, 53, has long been considered a strong contender for the top job since Amazon.com Inc created two CEO roles in 2016 reporting to Bezos, the other held by recently retired consumer CEO Jeff Wilke.  However, few were expecting Bezos to step down when the company on Tuesday reported quarterly sales above $100 billion for the first time, delivering goods and gaining more cloud customers during the coronavirus pandemic.  鈥淭he timing of the announcement comes as a surprise, the appointment of Jassy is not surprising,鈥?D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said.  鈥淏ut, will not be surprised if Amazon stock is under pressure once Jassy takes over, given the market鈥檚 fondness for Bezos.鈥? Shares of the e-commerce giant, which gained about 76% in 2020, were up marginally on Wednesday morning at $3,404. They have risen 8% since mid-January in the run-up to the results.  鈥淭he upside to the stock price is limited given the performance into the numbers and given what鈥檚 coming in the next 3-6 months - the vaccine rollouts,鈥?said Keith Temperton, an equity sales trader at Forte Securities.  鈥淎mazon model might be seen as starting to get a little bit expensive, given that people might start thinking about actually leaving their houses.鈥? At least 17 brokerages raised their price target on Amazon鈥檚 stock and 46 brokerages have a 鈥渂uy鈥?or higher rating, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon.  Jassy joined Amazon in 1997 after Harvard Business School, founding Amazon Web Services, known as AWS, and growing it to a cloud platform used by millions of customers.  Analysts said Bezos, now among the world鈥檚 richest men who started Amazon as an internet bookseller in a garage 27 years ago, had already stepped back from much of the company鈥檚 day-to-day operations and Jassy鈥檚 leadership has its benefits.  鈥淣aming Andy Jassy CEO and Amazon鈥檚 pivot to a services company will definitely take some of the heat away from the antitrust probe and decrease the likelihood of it,鈥?Forte said.

2021/2/3,"(Reuters) -Amazon.com鈥檚 new chief executive, Andy Jassy, who joined the company in 1997 and has overseen its fast-growing cloud computing business, says the key to long-term success is reinvention.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  鈥淵ou want to be reinventing when you are healthy, you want to be reinventing all the time,鈥?Jassy, 53, said in December at a company forum. 鈥淵ou have got to be manancial and relentless and tenacious about getting to the truth.... You have to know what鈥檚 working and what鈥檚 not working.鈥? He cited Netflix鈥檚 decision to cannibalize its own DVD rental business in favor of streaming.  The focus on the future is fitting given Jassy鈥檚 career is defined by his leading Amazon into a wholly new market: cloud computing. Amazon Web Services rents space and software programming for customers to run their technical operations on the company鈥檚 servers. The arm now fuels Amazon鈥檚 profits and dominates the cloud market just as the company leads the world of e-commerce.  Jassy, who joined Amazon after graduating from Harvard Business School, worked as a technical assistant for Bezos in the early 2000s and was instrumental in leading the company鈥檚 push outside of book sales.  Jassy鈥檚 rise to the top job looked clear after longtime executive and consumer chief Jeff Wilke announced his retirement after more than two decades with the company. Wilke was Amazon鈥檚 second most high-ranking official along with Jassy.  His attitude of embracing change also made him a favorite.  At the same speech in December, Jassy noted just 83 of the Fortune 500 companies from 1970 are still on the list -- and only half are on the list from 2000.  鈥淚t鈥檚 really hard to build a business that sustains for a long period of time,鈥?Jassy said, adding, to stay on the list, he said, 鈥測ou are going to have to reinvent yourself鈥?and often more than once.  He said the pandemic has boosted the shift to the cloud.  鈥淲hen you look back on the history of the cloud it will turn out the pandemic accelerated cloud adoption by several years,鈥?Jassy said.  One of his big challenges has been navigating the loss of a $10 billion Pentagon cloud contract to Microsoft and Jassy did not mince words when going after former President Donald Trump for unfairly influencing the process.  Outside of Amazon, Jassy is an avid sports fan. Jassy is part-owner of the new Seattle National Hockey League franchise, the Kraken, which will join the league in the 2021-2022 season."

However, few were expecting Bezos to step down when the company on Tuesday reported sales above $100 billion for the first time in a hugely successful year delivering goods in the coronavirus pandemic.  鈥淲e expect Amazon鈥檚 equity to trade higher ... but expect a more tempered response given the change in CEO,鈥?Citigroup analysts wrote in a research note.  Shares of the company, which gained about 76% in 2020, were up marginally on Wednesday morning at $3,444. They rose 8% since mid-January in the run-up to the results.  鈥淭he upside to the stock price is limited given the performance into the numbers and given what鈥檚 coming in the next 3-6 months - the vaccine rollouts,鈥?said Keith Temperton, an equity sales trader at Forte Securities.  鈥淎mazon model might be seen as starting to get a little bit expensive, given that people might start thinking about actually leaving their houses.鈥? At least 17 brokerages raised their price target on Amazon and 46 brokerages have a 鈥渂uy鈥?or higher rating on the stock, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon.  Jassy, 53, joined Amazon in 1997 after Harvard Business School, founding Amazon Web Services, known as AWS, and growing it to a cloud platform used by millions of customers.  Analysts noted that Bezos, now among the world鈥檚 richest men after starting Amazon as an internet bookseller in a garage 27 years ago, had already stepped back from much of the company鈥檚 day-to-day operations.  J.P.Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth dismissed some concerns around Jassy鈥檚 lack of experience in retail, saying that Jassy would continue Bezos鈥?same core values and beliefs given similar operating cultures between the consumer and AWS businesses.  鈥淎s part of Amazon鈥檚 S-team for years, Jassy has still been close to the Consumer business in which he originally started at Amazon,鈥?Anmuth said."
2021/2/2,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court blocked Future Group鈥檚 sale of a swathe of assets to rival Reliance Industries on Tuesday after Amazon raised objections to the $3.4 billion deal, in a battle of the retail titans that could reshape the shopping sector.  FILE PHOTO: A shipment moves on a conveyor belt at an Amazon Fulfillment Centre on the outskirts of Bengaluru, India, September 18, 2018. REUTERS/ Abhishek N. Chinnappa/File Photo  The decision is a setback for Future, the country鈥檚 second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, which agreed to sell its retail businesses to market leader Reliance last year. It has said it could face liquidation if the deal falls through.  U.S. online giant Amazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of the retail assets itself, argued a 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling them to anyone on a 鈥渞estricted persons鈥?list including Reliance.  The corporate battle has embroiled sprawling businesses led by two of the world鈥檚 richest men - Amazon鈥檚 Jeff Bezos and Reliance鈥檚 Mukesh Ambani.  It could help determine whether Amazon will be able to eat away at the dominance of Reliance, which sells through its network of more than 12,000 stores, at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has seen shoppers race online.  After Future said it was not bound by an arbitrator鈥檚 order that put the deal on hold, Amazon last month urged the High Court in New Delhi to enforce it.  Justice J. R. Midha said on Tuesday that an immediate order was necessary to protect the U.S. company鈥檚 rights, adding that the arbitrator had 鈥渞ightly proceeded鈥?against Future.  鈥淭his court is of the clear view that the (arbitration) order ... is enforceable,鈥?Midha added. 鈥淎ll the concerned authorities are directed to maintain status quo.鈥? Amazon said it welcomed the order. Future said it would explore all legal remedies to pursue the deal.  Reliance did not respond to requests for comment.  LEGAL BRAINS  Future鈥檚 planned deal to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and certain other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt, had already been cleared by Indian stock exchanges and the antitrust watchdog, though it was awaiting approval from a law tribunal.  Justice Midha directed a federal government counsel to relay the court鈥檚 decision to all authorities who were involved in reviewing the Future-Reliance deal. Future had acted 鈥渋n violation鈥?of the arbitrator鈥檚 order, he added.  Both Future and Amazon hired some of the country鈥檚 best legal brains to argue the matter, with the U.S. company engaging law firms P&A Law Offices and AZB & Partners.  Future, in sometimes acrimonious court arguments, accused Amazon of blocking its deal in an attempt to thwart any competition from Reliance, which has plans to expand into e-commerce.  Amazon said at some point it wanted to become a single largest shareholder of Future Retail, which it says 鈥渉as an irreplaceable and widespread network鈥?of outlets across India."

Alphabet, which will report the cost and operating profit of its Google Cloud business for the first time, added 1.5%, while retail behemoth Amazon.com Inc rose 1.4%.  Shares of both the companies, set to report their fourth-quarter earnings after market close, were among the top boosts to the S&P 500. The NYSE FANG+TM index firmed 1.4%.  鈥淭here鈥檚 no reason to think that the strength of earnings on the part of big tech is likely to diminish until perhaps later in the year and certainly the fourth quarter was likely to be a good one,鈥?said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.  Meanwhile, the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives prepared to take the first step forward on President Joe Biden鈥檚 $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package on Tuesday, with a key vote expected to fast-track the measure through Congress.  At 11:39 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 600.37 points, or 1.99%, to 30,812.28, the S&P 500 gained 65.25 points, or 1.73%, to 3,839.11 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 190.34 points, or 1.42%, to 13,593.73.  All the 11 major S&P sectors advanced, with economy-linked energy, financial and industrials gaining the most.  New cases of COVID-19 in the United States fell for a third week in a row, the first time since last September.  The number of people who have received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine is fast closing in the total infections across the country, according to U.S. CDC data as of Feb. 1.  鈥淚nvestors are going back to the script of strong earnings growth ... and expectations of an economic reopening, as the vaccine get more widely distributed and all of those point to the continuation of the markets upward trend,鈥?said Emanuel.  Wall Street鈥檚 fear gauge retreated to near one-week lows as a retail-driven mania for shorted assets showed signs of fizzling out.  GameStop Corp tumbled about 40%, falling sharply for the second day, while miners Hecla Mining Co and Coeur Mining Inc also tracked a drop in spot silver prices .  Exxon Mobil Corp posted its first annual loss as a public company. However, its shares rose about 4% as its quarterly adjusted profit topped estimates. Exxon鈥檚 shares, as well as a jump in oil prices lifted the energy sector by about 3%.  United Parcel Service Inc gained 2.4% after it beat quarterly profit estimates on a surge in home delivery volume due to pandemic-fueled online purchases of holiday gifts and staples.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.8-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.5-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

2021/2/2,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos will step down as CEO and become executive chairman, naming the head of its lucrative cloud computing division as successor in a sign of the company鈥檚 transformation from web retailer to internet conglomerate.  This summer, Bezos, 57, will hand the keys of the world鈥檚 largest online retailer to Andy Jassy, head of its cloud division Amazon Web Services known as AWS. The announcement on Tuesday settles a long-running question about who would replace the world鈥檚 second-richest person at the company鈥檚 helm.  Bezos is ending his role as CEO on a high note: the business he began as an internet bookseller 27 years ago is now one of the world鈥檚 most valuable companies and posted three consecutive record profits after losses in decades prior. On Tuesday, Amazon reported quarterly sales above $100 billion for the first time.  Jassy, 53, joined Amazon in 1997 after Harvard Business School, founding AWS and growing it to a cloud platform used by millions of customers, the company鈥檚 website said. He had been a clear contender for the top job since Amazon created two CEO roles reporting to Bezos years ago, the other held by recently retired consumer CEO Jeff Wilke.  Tom Johnson, chief transformation officer at global marketing firm Mindshare, said Jassy鈥檚 promotion underscored the centrality of the web hosting business to Amazon鈥檚 strategy.  鈥淛assy鈥檚 background in steering AWS shows just how top of mind those services are to Amazon鈥檚 business strategy. It鈥檒l be interesting to see how that affects their strategy and balancing that priority with a growing ad business and the commerce behemoth,鈥?he said.  Jassy is known for understanding highly technical details and has regularly taken jabs at legacy player Oracle Corp and cloud rival Microsoft Corp, which AWS continues to exceed in sales. Bezos has made fewer public remarks about competitors.  Under Jassy鈥檚 leadership, Amazon鈥檚 cloud business has signed major customers including Verizon, McDonald鈥檚 and Honeywell. Silicon Valley startups have long relied on AWS, and the division鈥檚 annual revenue grew 37% in 2019 and 30% in 2020, helping cement its position as the market leader.  One contract AWS failed to win was the $10 billion 鈥淛EDI鈥?project from the Pentagon, which was awarded to Microsoft.  Jassy has aimed to bestow a rock-star aura to keynotes at AWS鈥檚 annual Las Vegas conference, speaking before over 60,000 attendees in 2019 after upbeat music preceded his talk.  Bezos, who already has focused on other personal enterprises in years past, said in a note to employees posted on Amazon鈥檚 website, 鈥淎s Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions.鈥?Blue Origin is Bezos鈥?space company.  He added, 鈥淚鈥檝e never had more energy, and this isn鈥檛 about retiring.鈥? Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts that Bezos would work on 鈥渓arge one-way door issues,鈥?such as acquisitions and other strategies where there is a high cost to reversing course.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  COVID SPENDING DOWN  Amazon鈥檚 net sales rose to $125.6 billion as consumers turned to the world鈥檚 largest online retailer for their holiday shopping, beating analyst estimates of $119.7 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Amazon shares were up less than 1% in after-hours trading.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Jassy鈥檚 AWS, traditionally a bright spot, fell slightly short of expectations in the fourth quarter. While the cloud computing division recently announced deals with ViacomCBS, the BMW Group and others, it posted revenue of $12.7 billion, short of the $12.8 billion analysts had estimated.  Amazon said it was not naming an AWS replacement for Jassy at this time.  Meanwhile Amazon鈥檚 e-commerce business has never been as big. Since the start of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, consumers have turned to Amazon for delivery of home staples and medical supplies. While brick-and-mortar shops closed their doors, Amazon recruited over 400,000 more workers to keep up with demand.  That has placed the Seattle-based company at the center of workplace tumult. More than 19,000 have contracted COVID-19 as of September, and some staff have protested and demanded facility closures. Others, at Amazon鈥檚 Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse, are seeking to be the first at the company to unionize in the United States, with an election to begin next week.  Olsavsky told reporters on a conference call that costs associated with the pandemic in the first quarter are expected to total $2 billion, down from $4 billion in the fourth quarter as shopping volumes decrease. The company has taken an array of COVID-19 precautions and written government officials - including U.S. President Joe Biden - saying it is eager to offer vaccine shots to staff.  A boost in revenue came from moving Amazon鈥檚 marketing event Prime Day - usually in July - to October, lengthening the holiday shopping season.  Net sales for the current quarter are expected to be between $100 billion and $106 billion."

2021/2/2,"Founder, Chairman, CEO and President of Amazon Jeff Bezos speaks during an event about Blue Origin's space exploration plans in Washington, U.S., May 9, 2019. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Jeff Bezos has some solid timing. The founder and chief executive of Amazon.com is handing over the CEO role to Andy Jassy, head of the cloud division AWS, after a fortuitously good year at the $1.7 trillion retail giant. The new boss will face a different, more challenging normal that includes regulatory scrutiny.  First the results: Amazon said Tuesday that fourth-quarter revenue rose 44% year-over-year to $126 billion. That鈥檚 the first time the company topped $100 billion of sales in a quarter helped by delivering items to customer鈥檚 doorsteps during the pandemic and, of course, the holidays.  That鈥檚 the good news. The rest harkens some major challenges for Jassy. Operating expenses ballooned 42% in part because costs associated with worldwide shipping rose about two-thirds. The vaccine rollout will coincide with choice, which could make life harder for Amazon. The company is forecasting sales volume to drop by a quarter in this period compared to three months ending December.  The hurdles may partly be why Jassy is now leading the company. AWS is one of Amazon鈥檚 jewels. Growth slowed a tad in the fourth quarter to 28%, but the division has much higher margins than Amazon鈥檚 other units, booking more than half of its operating profit despite accounting for just 12% of total sales.  And yet Amazon鈥檚 success is precisely what will make Washington continue its pursuit of the retail giant. On the same day as earnings, Amazon agreed to pay more than $60 million to the Federal Trade Commission to settle charges it withheld some tips from drivers.  Time away from the corner office will give Bezos the opportunity to focus on his other projects including the Bezos Earth Fund and the Washington Post. He will likely continue to have a guiding hand, too, and perhaps will find himself in the Beltway hot seat. Still, the company鈥檚 forward enterprise value-to-sales figure is hovering near its high, hit earlier this year. As Bezos steps aside, Amazon is staring at the end of living high on the hog."
2021/2/2,"(Reuters) - GameStop Corp shares more than halved in value on Tuesday and silver prices retreated as the Reddit-driven trading frenzy that roiled stock and commodity markets appeared to fizzle, at least for now.  The videogame retailer鈥檚 shares, whose wild gyrations have made or lost billions of dollars for hedge funds and other investors in recent weeks, closed down 60% at $90. They are now worth less than a fifth of their high of $483 last week.  Posters on the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets, which was instrumental in fueling the rally, bemoaned the fall. ""Our darkest hour,"" read one post here by user name kigfik who said they were still holding the stock. Another user, Cinther, posted that they bought at $390 and ""lost so much that I don't even care anymore"" but were still holding.  鈥淭he rally is likely over (since) the short positions are pretty well taken care of,鈥?said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.  鈥淭hat鈥檚 the game you play when you do this thing. It can work for a while until it stops working and when it stops working, it reverses pretty quickly.鈥? Short sellers saw paper gains of $3.39 billion during Tuesday鈥檚 session, according to S3 Partners. Year-to-date realized and unrealized losses for shorts recently stood at $9.2 billion.  鈥淲e have had a lot of shorts take their losses and walk away from the trade,鈥?said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3鈥檚 managing director of predictive analytics.  Spot silver prices, which became an alternative focus in the battle between small traders and Wall Street hedge funds last week, fell more than 8% after hitting an eight-year high on Monday. The main silver ETF was down 8.3%.  The retail frenzy in silver has left some dealers scrambling for bars and coins to meet demand.  Analysts said the silver pullback may show the limits of small investors鈥?impact in a large and complicated market.  Online broker Robinhood, on whose platform much of the buying and selling has taken place, raised trading limits on GameStop Corp, AMC and other stocks, according to an update on its website on Tuesday.  鈥楤IZARRE SITUATIONS鈥? Analysts predicted that the market frenzy, which has drawn the attention of regulators and politicians, was likely to fade, and said it was just a question of how soon.  鈥淭his is a pretty narrow strategy that likely creates some bizarre situations like GameStop and AMC but it鈥檚 not broad enough to change how institutional investors are going to invest,鈥?said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.  鈥淭he strength of the move was so severe that it really opened up people鈥檚 eyes to the power of social media in the investment world.

REUTERS/Peter Andrews/File Photo  With hedge funds at the center of the market drama, the GameStop saga is likely to expedite a regulatory review of the ever-larger role played by non-bank firms in the financial markets, regulatory experts said.  Melvin Capital, one of the biggest funds betting on a drop in GameStop鈥檚 share price, lost 53% in January. Other funds like billionaire investor Steven Cohen鈥檚 Point72 Asset Management lost nearly 9%, investors in the funds said.  Point72 has opened to new cash and raised more than $1.5 billion in commitments, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.  Meanwhile, Robinhood鈥檚 app recorded more downloads than any other U.S. trading app last week, despite concerns its restrictions on transactions would alienate some users, according to market research data providers.  Robinhood, which raised $3.4 billion in emergency funds in the past week, plans an initial public offering later this year.  Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev said in a blog post that it was time to consider real-time settlement in U.S. equities trading, which currently follows a two-day settlement system.  鈥淭here is no reason why the greatest financial system the world has ever seen cannot settle trades in real time. Doing so would greatly mitigate the risk that such processing poses,鈥?said Tenev.  CME RAISED SILVER MARGINS  One big drag on silver prices was a Chicago Mercantile Exchange margin hike on contracts for the metal, which makes speculative trade more expensive.  Mining stocks including First Majestic Silver and Pan American Silver fell.  Posts on Tuesday on WallStreetBets ranged from those giving up on the GameStop trade to calls to stick with the stock.  鈥淩edditors are focused on meme stocks and that fight should continue - right now they think that silver is a distraction to their cause,鈥?said Ephraim Rinsky, a novelist who was one of the first Redditors to post about buying silver on WallStreetBets.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo  WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc agreed to pay more than $61.7 million to settle allegations it cheated Amazon Flex drivers out of nearly one-third of tips from customers for more than two years, the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday.  The money paid to the FTC will be used to compensate drivers, the agency said.  The FTC said Amazon in 2015 advertised that a program called Flex would pay drivers $18 to $25 an hour to make deliveries and that they would receive 100% of any tips. But in late 2016 Amazon “secretly reduced its own contribution to drivers’ pay,” according to the FTC complaint.  “Amazon used the customer tips to make up the difference between the new lower hourly rate and the promised rate,” the FTC said in a statement.  The FTC said Amazon dropped the controversial payment model in August 2019 after the agency opened an investigation.  Amazon said it disagreed that the way it reported pay to drivers was unclear.  “In total, Amazon stole nearly one-third of drivers’ tips to pad its own bottom line,” Commissioner Rohit Chopra, a Democrat, said in a statement.  He urged the FTC to examine whether workers need to be protected from “other dominant middlemen.”"

2021/2/2,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Delhi High Court blocked Future Group鈥檚 sale of a swathe of assets to rival Reliance Industries on Tuesday after Amazon raised objections to the $3.4 billion deal, in a battle of the retail titans that could reshape the shopping sector.  FILE PHOTO: An employee of Amazon walks through a turnstile gate inside an Amazon Fulfillment Centre (BLR7) on the outskirts of Bengaluru, India, September 18, 2018. REUTERS/ Abhishek N. Chinnappa  The decision is a setback for Future, the country鈥檚 second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, which agreed to sell its retail businesses to market leader Reliance last year. It has said it could face liquidation if the deal falls through.  U.S. online giant Amazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of the retail assets itself, argued a 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling them to anyone on a 鈥渞estricted persons鈥?list including Reliance.  The corporate battle has embroiled sprawling businesses led by two of the world鈥檚 richest men - Amazon鈥檚 Jeff Bezos and Reliance鈥檚 Mukesh Ambani.  It could help determine whether Amazon will be able to eat away at the dominance of Reliance, which sells through its network of more than 12,000 stores, at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has seen shoppers race online.  After Future said it was not bound by an arbitrator鈥檚 order that put the deal on hold, Amazon last month urged the Delhi High Court to enforce it.  Justice J. R. Midha said on Tuesday that an immediate order was necessary to protect the U.S. company鈥檚 rights, adding that the arbitrator had 鈥渞ightly proceeded鈥?against Future.  鈥淭his court is of the clear view that the (arbitration) order ... is enforceable,鈥?Midha added. 鈥淎ll the concerned authorities are directed to maintain status quo.鈥? Amazon said it welcomed the order. Future said it would explore all legal remedies to pursue the deal.  Reliance did not respond to requests for comment.  LEGAL BRAINS  Future鈥檚 planned deal to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and certain other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt, had already been cleared by Indian stock exchanges and the antitrust watchdog, though it was awaiting approval from a law tribunal.  Justice Midha directed a government counsel to relay the court鈥檚 decision to all authorities who were involved in reviewing the Future-Reliance deal. Future had acted 鈥渋n violation鈥?of the arbitrator鈥檚 order, he added.  Both Future and Amazon hired some of the country鈥檚 best legal brains to argue the matter, with the U.S. company engaging law firms P&A Law Offices and AZB & Partners.  Future, in sometimes acrimonious court arguments, accused Amazon of blocking its deal in an attempt to thwart any competition from Reliance, which has plans to expand into e-commerce.  Amazon said at some point it wanted to become a single largest shareholder of Future Retail, which it says 鈥渉as an irreplaceable and widespread network鈥?of outlets across India."

2021/2/1,"MUMBAI (Reuters Breakingviews) - Jeff Bezos has the patience and gritty determination it takes do business in India. The Amazon boss is locked in an ugly fight to stop a troubled big-box retailer from selling itself to his biggest rival, Mukesh Ambani鈥檚 $166 billion Reliance Industries. Any victory by the U.S. e-commerce giant could wind up costing thousands of jobs and spark a nasty political backlash, but the standoff also might deliver longer-term rewards.  FILE PHOTO: Kishore Biyani, CEO and founder of India's Future Group poses after the inauguration of Foodhall, a premium lifestyle food superstore by the Future Group, store in Mumbai, India, December 1, 2018. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File Photo  Ambani will turbocharge his retail business if he successfully acquires Kishore Biyani鈥檚 sprawling Future empire. The $3.4 billion deal announced in August includes more than 17 companies. In addition to its huge oil and telecom operations, Reliance is India鈥檚 top brick-and-mortar retailer, with some 12,000 stores. Swallowing Future Retail, its closest competitor, would bag another 1,500. India鈥檚 Competition Commission already has cleared the deal.  The takeover would trample over part of Amazon鈥檚 expansion strategy in online groceries. It has a partnership with Future Retail, including its Big Bazaar hypermarkets. The $1.6 trillion company snapped up upscale U.S. supermarket chain Whole Foods back in 2017 in its biggest acquisition. In India, however, where Amazon already has invested some $6.5 billion over the past decade, it lacks its own physical shops. Even Walmart鈥檚 Indian online marketplace, Flipkart, has the benefit of the Best Price cash-and-carry stores operated by its parent company.  In its push to stop the sale to Reliance, Amazon has been accused of acting like the East India Company, a 17th century London start-up whose employees killed, pillaged and bribed as they conquered the subcontinent. Counsel for Biyani鈥檚 Future group have trotted out the provocative comparison to complain that a foreign company is using a dubious minority investment to decide the fate of a struggling Indian outfit.  COUPON CLIPPING  Amazon鈥檚 involvement is contentious. Bezos took a circuitous route to sink his claws into Future Retail after debt issues prompted Biyani to consider selling. India does not welcome foreign direct investment into physical retailers that sell multiple brands. Indian politicians consider mom-and-pop store owners as an important constituency. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi is easing investment restrictions across multiple sectors and Bezos reasonably took a punt that rules governing retail might change too.  On that basis, Amazon spent about $200 million in August 2019 to pick up a 49% stake in Future Coupons, a wholesaling part of the group. As part of the deal, Biyani and his related entities agreed to restrictions on transferring shares. According to Amazon, that included to Reliance. At the time, Biyani鈥檚 group, along with Future Coupons, controlled Future Retail through stock and warrants. Days earlier, Future Coupons inked a separate agreement giving it the right to veto any transfer of assets by Future Retail, effectively locking up the shopping assets.  Almost exactly a year later, as Biyani鈥檚 debt problems ballooned, Amazon was shoved aside. Reliance swooped in and agreed to its own complex, multistage deal to buy Future鈥檚 retail, wholesale and supply chain businesses. If that transaction closes, Amazon and other investors in Future companies will end up owning shares in a rump that holds a hodgepodge of assets including an insurance joint venture with Generali.  India鈥檚 foreign investment rules mean Amazon is precluded from offering an alternative deal to Reliance鈥檚 to stop Future Retail from going into liquidation, which could save some 29,000 jobs. Amazon had lined up friendly domestic backers to try and help before the Reliance deal was struck. They were interested in the retail operations, but not much of the rest. Either way, any such investors are unlikely to be interested in going up against India鈥檚 richest man.  Bezos is not intimidated, however. He鈥檚 fighting to uphold Amazon鈥檚 original agreement, in part to make clear that he won鈥檛 be pushed around. The company in October won an emergency hold on the transaction through an arbitration in Singapore, and lawyers for both sides are now arguing in a Delhi court about whether that ruling applies in India. The outcome is key to Future group鈥檚 fate and the dispute could go all the way to the country鈥檚 top court.  PRECEDENTS SET  Amazon is testing the enforceability of contracts in the world鈥檚 fifth largest economy, a measure of the ease of doing business. It鈥檚 also a fresh test to see if local courts uphold foreign arbitration awards; overseas companies with Indian partners typically look to London or Singapore tribunals. Japanese telecom operator NTT Docomo and pharmaceutical company Daiichi Sankyo both won overseas arbitrations against commercial partners and those rulings were upheld in India.  Politicians reeling from the pandemic won鈥檛 be pleased if Amazon鈥檚 aggressive move results in job losses. A local media report last week suggested an official investigative agency is probing the company鈥檚 Future deal for potential violations of foreign investment rules. But India is better off with Amazon than without it. The company operates 60 massive fulfilment centres and is creating jobs, developing logistics and supporting exports by small- and medium-sized Indian businesses.  The entire mess might have been avoided had India set a stronger example for tycoons to follow. Even now it is unclear if the government will honour two recent arbitration rulings it lost over tax disputes with British companies. Cairn Energy has written to New Delhi threatening to seize Indian assets overseas if it fails to pay the $1.4 billion awarded in its favour. Unlike Vodafone, which also won its case, the oil and gas explorer can afford to play hardball because it is no longer invested in the country.  Future鈥檚 retail assets are a prize, but not necessarily a must-have in a fragmented retail market. The bigger message is Amazon鈥檚 willingness to fight against powerful rivals. To win in India, that is what it will take."
2021/1/30,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc鈥檚 bid to stall Future Group鈥檚 $3.4 billion retail assets sale is similar to Alexander the Great鈥檚 鈥渞uthless ambition to scorch the earth鈥? the Indian group鈥檚 CEO Kishore Biyani said in an internal staff memo seen by Reuters.

REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File Photo  Amazon, locked in protracted legal disputes with Future, alleges the Indian firm violated contracts by agreeing to sell its retail assets to Reliance Industries last year. Future denies wrongdoing.  The two sides this week traded barbs in a New Delhi court, the latest legal case where Amazon is seeking to block the sale. India鈥檚 second-largest retailer says the deal is critical for the survival of its 1,700 stores and thousands of employees.  Dubbing it a corporate battle 鈥渇or supremacy over Indian customers鈥? Biyani鈥檚 staff e-mail late on Friday said Amazon was 鈥減laying the dog in the manger鈥?  Taking a further dig at Amazon, he said the 鈥渧exatious litigation and harassment makes one wonder about the similarity in ruthless ambition to scorch the earth akin to the Greek Alexander - after all, they are inspired to name their product as Alexa鈥?  鈥淗istory tells us that Alexander conquered large parts of the world but failed in India.鈥? The Macedonian leader鈥檚 military campaign greatly expanded the Greek-speaking empire throughout the Middle East and parts of Asia, ushering in the Hellenistic age before he died in present-day Iraq in 323 B.C.  Amazon declined to comment on the memo by Biyani, often referred to as India鈥檚 retail king for transforming the country鈥檚 retailing in recent decades.  In the latest court case, Amazon has also asked the judge to detain Biyani in a civil prison, arguing his firm 鈥渄eliberately鈥?disobeyed a Singapore arbitrator鈥檚 October order that put the deal on hold.  Future maintains that arbitration order is not binding.  Its lawyer on Friday said Amazon was trying to block the deal because it will make it difficult for the U.S. firm to compete with Reliance, led by one of Asia鈥檚 richest man, Mukesh Ambani, who is fast expanding into e-commerce.  鈥淎mazon is only interested that Reliance should not improve in India,鈥?said Future鈥檚 counsel Harish Salve. The next court hearing is on Monday.  Indian stock exchanges this month cleared Future鈥檚 deal with Reliance, despite Amazon鈥檚 repeated requests to regulators to block the deal.  鈥淲e are on firm legal footing and this is vindicated by the approvals,鈥?Biyani said in his memo."
2021/1/29,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A U.S. lobby group which represents firms including Amazon.com and Walmart has urged India not to tighten foreign investment rules for e-commerce companies again, according to a letter seen by Reuters.  FILE PHOTO: A shipment moves on a conveyor belt at an Amazon Fulfillment Centre (BLR7) on the outskirts of Bengaluru, India, September 18, 2018. REUTERS/ Abhishek N. Chinnappa/File Photo  India is considering revising the rules after traders in the country accused Amazon鈥檚 Indian division and Walmart鈥檚 Flipkart of creating complex structures to bypass investment regulations, Reuters reported this month.  The U.S. companies deny any wrongdoing.  India only allows foreign e-commerce players to operate as a marketplace to connect buyers and sellers but local traders say the U.S. giants promote select sellers and offer deep discounts, which hurts business for smaller local retailers.  In 2018, India changed its foreign direct investment (FDI) rules to deter foreign firms offering products from sellers in which they have an equity stake.  The government is now considering tightening those rules again to include sellers in which a foreign e-commerce firm holds an indirect stake through its parent, Reuters reported.  Such a change could hurt Amazon as it holds indirect stakes in two of its biggest online sellers in India, Cloudtail and Appario.  Citing the Reuters story in a Jan. 28 letter, the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC), part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged the Indian government not to make any more material restrictive changes to e-commerce investment rules.  鈥淎ny further changes in FDI rules would limit e-commerce firms from leveraging their scale,鈥?USIBC said in the letter seen by Reuters.  USIBC also asked India鈥檚 Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) to engage in substantive consultation with companies on e-commerce regulation.  USIBC and DPIIT did not respond to a request for comment.  After the Reuters story was published last week, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which represents millions of brick-and-mortar retailers, said it has received assurances from India鈥檚 commerce minister that policy changes were in the offing.  On Saturday, CAIT in a statement said the USIBC letter was an 鈥渦ncalled for intervention鈥?which runs against the interest of 85 million traders. 鈥淪uch a hue and cry is not understandable,鈥?CAIT said, adding that it had also written a letter in protest to the USIBC President.  The government is also considering prohibiting online sales by a seller who, for example, purchases goods from an e-commerce entity鈥檚 wholesale unit, or any of its group firms, and then sells them on the entity鈥檚 websites, Reuters has reported.  The 2018 rule changes soured relations between India and the United States, as Washington said the policy changes favoured local e-commerce retailers over U.S. companies.  Industry sources told Reuters on Friday that the prospects of such frequent policy changes in India have alarmed Amazon, which has committed $6.5 billion in investments in India, and Walmart, which invested $16 billion in Flipkart in 2018.  The USIBC letter said 鈥渋nvestments require reasonable policy predictability and fair treatment鈥?  鈥淯SIBC is concerned that material changes to the FDI policy creates uncertainty and impacts investor confidence, as well as business continuity of existing investments,鈥?it said.  Amazon declined to comment on the USIBC letter. Walmart and Flipkart did not respond to requests for comment."

Indian stock exchanges last week cleared Future鈥檚 deal with Reliance but another key approval is needed from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), as per Indian law. The approval is key for Future to seal the deal, without which the country鈥檚 second largest retailer could face liquidation.  The outcome of the dispute embroiling Future, Reliance and Amazon is seen shaping India鈥檚 retail landscape, especially in deciding who will take the top spot in the fast-growing groceries market all are competing in.  Future has filed a petition with the NCLT on Jan. 26, Darius Khambata, the lawyer for Future, told the Delhi High Court during a hearing in a separate ongoing legal fight over the deal.  In the court, Amazon and Future are currently arguing over the applicability of an October injunction by a Singapore arbitrator, which both sides agreed to use in case of disputes. The arbitrator had said Future-Reliance deal should be put on hold.  Future has maintained the arbitration order is not binding on it, while Amazon says it is.  Lawyers for Amazon on Thursday criticized Future during the hearing for approaching the NCLT for approval, while the Delhi court was hearing a matter over the deal.  The judge will continue to hear the arguments on Friday.  The dispute centres around Future鈥檚 decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.

Microsoft and Amazon alone had a combined worldwide market share of more than 50% in the third quarter of 2020, according to Synergy Research Group.  This dominance has raised concerns in Europe that sensitive corporate data could be insecure in the wake of the adoption of the U.S. CLOUD Act of 2018 and in the absence of any major competitors, except China鈥檚 Alibaba.  The concerns led to creation of European association Gaia-X, set up to establish common standards for storing and processing data on servers that are sited locally and comply with the European Union鈥檚 strict laws on data privacy.  Atos and OVHcloud say they together have a network of 130 data centres able to host data in virtual spaces whose resources are not shared with other users, or private environments.  French cybersecurity agency ANSSI recently granted its so-called SecNumCloud label to OVHcloud, a certification that requires the implementation of high security standards.

Amazon argues Future breached some pre-existing clauses by entering into a deal with Reliance, but the Indian group has maintained the arbitrator鈥檚 order is not binding and needs to be ratified by an Indian court.  The U.S. group鈥檚 latest court move comes after Indian stock exchanges last week gave the go ahead to the Future deal, after communicating with India鈥檚 markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).  The Amazon filing also argued that Future should not rely on any regulatory approval it has received, in light of the arbitrator鈥檚 injunction.  The dispute centres around Future鈥檚 decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.  Amazon argues that a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group couldn鈥檛 sell its retail assets to anyone on a 鈥渞estricted persons鈥?list including Reliance.  The outcome of the dispute embroiling Future, Reliance and Amazon is seen shaping India鈥檚 retail landscape, especially in deciding who will occupy the top spot in the groceries market which could be worth around $740 billion a year by 2024, according to a forecast by Forrester Research."
2021/1/22,"CHERBOURG, France/DUBLIN (Reuters) - From his office overlooking Cherbourg docks, general manager Yannick Millet points to trailers destined for Ireland that belong to Amazon and FedEx, new customers and a signal of a potential big shift in post-Brexit trade.  Confronted by red tape and delays after Britain鈥檚 messy exit from the European Union, Irish traders are shipping goods directly to and from European ports, shunning the once-speedier route through Britain.  鈥淵ou see the shift in supply chains right here,鈥?he said.  All five operators connecting Ireland to mainland Europe have increased ferry services in the past nine months, with some bringing forward planned sailings and others moving larger ships away from quieter British routes to meet new demand.  Millet forecast Cherbourg would handle 9,000 trucks in January, equivalent to almost a quarter of what passed through the French port annually before the COVID-19 crisis.  For decades, the land bridge offered Irish traders the swiftest, most reliable route to continental Europe. It involves a short sea crossing between Dublin and Holyhead in Wales and then a hop between Dover and Calais. Every year 150,000 lorries would use the route.  But post-Brexit paperwork and delays in customs clearance are snarling up the process, adding hours or days to journeys and ratcheting up costs. Many companies are switching routes.  鈥淭his is a game-changer,鈥?said Chris Smyth, commercial director at Ireland鈥檚 Perennial Freight. Demand was huge for freight space to ship to Cherbourg, Dunkirk, Rotterdam and Zeebrugge, he added.  Cherbourg鈥檚 business before Brexit had been evenly split between Ireland and Britain. Now, the port would orient itself towards Ireland, Millet said.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  鈥淚 thought traffic would double but it has tripled,鈥?he said. 鈥淭he question now is whether the traffic volumes we see today will hold in the months to come.鈥? AVOIDING THE MIDDLEMAN  Stena Line, the largest Irish Sea operator, has doubled its services on the booming Rosslare-Cherbourg route, temporarily cancelling some sailings to Britain after freight volumes fell 60% in the first half of January.  Irish Ferries has deployed a larger vessel out of Dublin and planned to add more weekly rotations next month, the Port of Cherbourg said. Brittany Ferries also brought forward a planned sailing linking France and Ireland.  Danish operator DFDS said the freight ferries plying its new 23-hour crossing from Rosslare to Dunkirk six days a week were 鈥減retty much full鈥? Route director Aidan Coffey said capturing 30% of 鈥渓and bridge鈥?traffic would make the route viable and DFDS might soon add up to two more sailings per week.  鈥淲e鈥檙e blown away by the demand,鈥?Coffey said.  No one knows if the shift is permanent.  The Irish Maritime Development Office, a government shipping promotion body, said a return to pre-Brexit logistic chains would depend on the speed of customs formalities along the land bridge and that ferries linking Ireland and mainland Europe could not replicate its volumes.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Eddie Burke, a senior official at Ireland鈥檚 transport department, said the route through Britain would undoubtedly come back into play again.  Ferry operators were taking decisions on capacity week by week, said Ole Bockmann, Stena鈥檚 operations chief in Cherbourg. Reverting to land bridge routes was simple, he said. 鈥淲e just take the ships off and go back to the old system.鈥? RENAISSANCE  It gives ports like Cherbourg and Ireland鈥檚 Rosslare a narrow window to persuade traders that the longer sea crossing between Ireland and mainland Europe is commercially viable for just-in-time logistics.  Eighteen months ago, Rosslare on the southeastern tip of Ireland was struggling. Its traffic volumes were stagnant while rivals were enjoying a 10-year run of growth.  Now its general manager, Glenn Carr, is fending off complaints about the number trucks passing through after freight traffic increased 500% in the first half of January.  Carr said the old perception that direct crossings from Ireland were too long for fresh food and just-in-time supply chains was changing. Many of the companies that had switched from the land bridge would remain, he forecast.  鈥淚 was talking to some multinationals only this week and the question they asked me was, 鈥楪lenn, are you putting on more services?鈥欌€? An 18-hour ferry ride away, Cherbourg port鈥檚 Millet said his immediate priority was responding to shipping companies demands for better restaurants and washrooms for truckers and ironing out quayside glitches in the loading of extra vessels.  鈥淏rexit has for us been an opportunity to rethink our port,鈥?he said."

2021/1/21,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday rejected Parler鈥檚 demand that Amazon.com Inc restore web hosting services for the social media platform, which Amazon had cut off following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein in Seattle said Parler was unlikely to prove Amazon breached its contract or violated antitrust law by suspending service on Jan. 10, and that it was 鈥渘ot a close call.鈥? She also forcefully rejected the suggestion that the public interest would be served by a preliminary injunction requiring Amazon Web Services to 鈥渉ost the kind of abusive, violent content at issue in this case, particularly in light of the recent riots at the U.S. Capitol.鈥? 鈥淭hat event,鈥?she added, 鈥渨as a tragic reminder that inflammatory rhetoric can - more swiftly and easily than many of us would have hoped - turn a lawful protest into a violent insurrection.鈥?

PARLER.COM WEBSITE /via REUTERS  Researchers have said far-right groups at the Capitol had a vigorous online presence on platforms including Parler, where they spread violent rhetoric.  Parler said there was no evidence apart from anecdotes in the press that it had a role in inciting the riots, and that it was unfair to deprive millions of law-abiding Americans a platform for free speech.  It also said Amazon had no right to threaten its 鈥渆xtinction鈥?by pulling the plug, and had been motivated by 鈥減olitical animus鈥?to benefit Twitter Inc, a larger Amazon client that Parler said did not censor violent content targeting conservatives.  Rothstein rejected that argument, saying Parler had merely raised the 鈥渟pecter of preferential treatment鈥?for Twitter.  Many supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump favor Parler, which has claimed it had more than 12 million users.  Parler remains largely offline after being dropped by Seattle-based Amazon and the app stores of Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc鈥檚 Google following the Washington unrest.  Those companies also cited Parler鈥檚 record of policing violent content.  Parler Chief Executive Officer John Matze told Reuters on Jan. 13 that Parler may be offline for good, but later pledged it would return stronger.

2021/1/19,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is considering revising its foreign investment rules for e-commerce, three sources and a government spokesman told Reuters, a move that could compel players, including Amazon.com Inc, to restructure their ties with some major sellers.  FILE PHOTO: People move past a hoarding of Amazon India outside a metro rail station in New Delhi, India, October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis/File Photo  The government discussions coincide with a growing number of complaints from India’s bricks-and-mortar retailers, which have for years accused Amazon and Walmart Inc-controlled Flipkart of creating complex structures to bypass federal rules, allegations the U.S. companies deny.  India only allows foreign e-commerce players to operate as a marketplace to connect buyers and sellers. It prohibits them from holding inventories of goods and directly selling them on their platforms.  Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart were last hit in Dec. 2018 by investment rule changes that barred foreign e-commerce players from offering products from sellers in which they have an equity stake.  Now, the government is considering adjusting some provisions to prevent those arrangements, even if the e-commerce firm holds an indirect stake in a seller through its parent, three sources said. The sources asked not to be named because the discussions are private.  The changes could hurt Amazon as it holds indirect equity stakes in two of its biggest online sellers in India.  Amazon said e-commerce created “huge job opportunities” and is a significant contributor to economic growth. “Any major alterations” to the policy will adversely impact small- and medium-sized busineses, it said in an emailed statement.  Walmart and Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Yogesh Baweja, the spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, which is working on the issue, confirmed to Reuters any changes will be announced through a so-called “press note,” which contains foreign direct investment rules. He did not give details.  “It’s a work in progress,” Baweja said, adding an internal meeting on the subject last took place about a month ago.  “Of course Amazon’s a big player so whatever advice, whatever suggestions, whatever recommendations they make, they are also given due consideration.”  FRAYED TIES  The 2018 rules forced Amazon and Flipkart to rework their business structures and soured relations between India and the United States, as Washington said the policy change favoured local e-tailers over U.S. ones.  India’s e-commerce retail market is seen growing to $200 billion a year by 2026, from $30 billion in 2019, the country’s investment promotion agency Invest India estimates.  Domestic traders have been unhappy about the growth. They see foreign e-commerce businesses as a threat to their livelihoods and accuse them of unfair business practices that use steep discounts to target rapid growth. The companies deny they are acting unfairly.  “The way the government is thinking is that marketplaces are not doing what they are supposed to do. The government wants to tinker with the nuts and bolts of the policy,” said one of the sources who is familiar with the talks on the policy changes.  LIMITING WHOLESALE TIES  India’s trade minister Piyush Goyal has been critical of e-commerce companies in private meetings and told them to follow all laws in letter and spirit, Reuters has previously reported.  In the face of growing trader complaints and an antitrust investigation, Goyal last year said Amazon was not doing “a great favour to India” by making fresh investments.  Among other changes, the government is considering changes that would effectively prohibit online sales by a seller who purchases goods from the e-commerce entity or its group firm, and then sells them on the entity’s websites, two of the sources said.  Under existing rules, a seller is free to buy up to 25% of its inventory from the e-commerce entity’s wholesale or another unit and then sell them on the e-commerce website.  A boom in e-commerce in India accelerated last year when the COVID-19 pandemic drove more shoppers online. Flipkart, in which Walmart invested $16 billion in 2018, and Amazon are among the top two players.  “E-commerce has already made its mark for itself in the country, particularly during COVID-19,” Commerce Ministry’s Baweja said. “They are bound to grow and a conducive environment should be there, which is good for the brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce.”"

2021/1/19,"* India working on e-commerce policy changes - sources  * India considering tweaking clause on equity - sources  * India government spokesman says policy change being considered  * Past changes have hit Amazon, Walmart  NEW DELHI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - India is considering revising its foreign investment rules for e-commerce, three sources and a government spokesman told Reuters, a move that could compel players, including Amazon.com Inc, to restructure their ties with some major sellers.  The government discussions coincide with a growing number of complaints from India鈥檚 brick-and-mortar retailers, which have for years accused Amazon and Walmart Inc-controlled Flipkart of creating complex structures to bypass federal rules, allegations the U.S. companies deny.  India only allows foreign e-commerce players to operate as a marketplace to connect buyers and sellers. It prohibits them from holding inventories of goods and directly selling them on their platforms.  Amazon and Walmart鈥檚 Flipkart were last hit in Dec. 2018 by investment rule changes that barred foreign e-commerce players from offering products from sellers in which they have an equity stake.  Now, the government is considering adjusting some provisions to prevent those arrangements, even if the e-commerce firm holds an indirect stake in a seller through its parent, three sources said. The sources asked not to be named because the discussions are private.  The changes could hurt Amazon as it holds indirect equity stakes in two of its biggest online sellers in India.  Amazon, Walmart and Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Yogesh Baweja, the spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, which is working on the issue, confirmed to Reuters any changes will be announced through a so-called 鈥減ress note,鈥?which contains foreign direct investment rules. He did not give any details.  鈥淚t鈥檚 a work in progress,鈥?Baweja said, adding an internal meeting on the subject last took place about a month ago.  鈥淥f course Amazon鈥檚 a big player so whatever advice, whatever suggestions, whatever recommendations they make, they are also given due consideration.鈥? FRAYED TIES  The 2018 rules forced Amazon and Flipkart to rework their business structures and soured relations between India and the United States, as Washington said the policy change favoured local e-tailers over U.S. ones.  India鈥檚 e-commerce retail market is seen growing to $200 billion a year by 2026, from $30 billion in 2019, the country鈥檚 investment promotion agency Invest India estimates.  Domestic traders have been unhappy about the growth. They see foreign e-commerce businesses as a threat to their livelihoods and accuse them of unfair business practices that use steep discounts to target rapid growth. The companies deny they are acting unfairly.  鈥淭he way the government is thinking is that marketplaces are not doing what they are supposed to do. The government wants to tinker with the nuts and bolts of the policy,鈥?said one of the sources who is familiar with the talks on the policy changes.  LIMITING WHOLESALE TIES  India鈥檚 trade minister Piyush Goyal has been critical of e-commerce companies in private meetings and told them to follow all laws in letter and spirit, Reuters has previously reported.  In the face of growing trader complaints and an antitrust investigation, Goyal last year said Amazon was not doing 鈥渁 great favour to India鈥?by making fresh investments.  Among other changes, the government is considering changes that would effectively prohibit online sales by a seller who purchases goods from the e-commerce entity or its group firm, and then sells them on the entity鈥檚 websites, two of the sources said.  Under existing rules, a seller is free to buy up to 25% of its inventory from the e-commerce entity鈥檚 wholesale or another unit and then sell them on the e-commerce website.  A boom in e-commerce in India accelerated last year when the COVID-19 pandemic drove more shoppers online. Flipkart, in which Walmart invested $16 billion in 2018, and Amazon are among the top two players.  鈥淓commerce has already made its mark for itself in the country, particularly during COVID-19,鈥?Commerce Ministry鈥檚 Baweja said. 鈥淭hey are bound to grow and a conducive environment should be there, which is good for the brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce.鈥?(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Krishna Das in New Delhi; Additional reporting by Aftab Ahmed; Editing by Euan Rocha and Barbara Lewis)"
2021/1/15,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc鈥檚 first U.S. union election since 2014 is scheduled to begin with the mailing of ballots in early February and a vote count starting March 30, a U.S. labor board official said in a filing on Friday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The announcement brings employees at Amazon鈥檚 fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama, a step closer to deciding whether to join part of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). A 鈥測es鈥?vote would mark the first-ever for a U.S. Amazon facility.  Unions have had greater success organizing at Amazon elsewhere, such as in France, where they precipitated a month-long closure of its warehouses last year.  As of Jan. 7, Amazon employed almost 6,200 hourly workers at the warehouse, according to the filing. To win, the union needs a simple majority of those who submit ballots.  While Amazon had preferred in-person voting, the labor board sided with the union on a mail-in procedure 鈥渂ecause this is the safest and most appropriate method of conducting an election in view of the extraordinary circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic,鈥?the filing said.  America's second-largest private employer after Walmart Inc, Amazon has long avoided unionization, and it has trained managers to spot organizing activity. A website, doitwithoutdues.com www.doitwithoutdues.com, warns the Bessemer employees, ""why pay almost $500 in dues? We鈥檝e got you covered* with high wages, health care, vision, and dental benefits.""  In statements, Amazon said the website鈥檚 purpose was to educate staff about 鈥渢he facts of joining a union鈥?and that 鈥淲e will continue to insist on measures for a fair election.鈥?The company added that its rejected proposal for an in-person election would improve 鈥渁ssociate convenience, vote fidelity, and timeliness of vote count.鈥? The RWDSU declined to comment.  The world鈥檚 largest online retailer has faced criticism over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting some workers to protest outside warehouses and demand their closure. Labor organizing has begun in different parts of the company.  Amazon, reporting more than 19,000 COVID-19 cases as of September, has said it increased cleaning, rolled out virus tests and temperature checks, and added other measures to protect associates.  Ballots will be mailed on Feb. 8, the board filing said."
2021/1/15,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc was slapped with a class-action lawsuit on Thursday accusing the e-commerce giant of inflating the prices of ebooks in collusion with some publishers.

(refini.tv/2MXXVqs)  The lawsuit comes a day after Connecticut said it was investigating Amazon for potential anti-competitive behavior in its business selling digital books.  Amazon declined to comment.  About 90% of eBooks are sold through Amazon, the largest U.S. eBooks seller, the lawsuit claimed.

2021/1/14,"(Reuters) - There鈥檚 a lot going on in the complaint the conservative microblogging service Parler filed Monday against Amazon Web Services in federal court in Seattle.  As you surely know, Amazon disclosed on Jan. 10 that it was suspending its web-hosting services for Parler because, in Amazon鈥檚 view, Parler had failed to respond to a steady increase in violent content after the Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill. Parler alleged in its lawsuit the next day and in an accompanying motion for a temporary restraining order that Amazon, driven by 鈥減olitical animus鈥?and a desire to boost Parler鈥檚 competitor Twitter, had sabotaged Parler at precisely the moment that Parler was poised for explosive growth. Parler counsel David Groesbeck accused Amazon of violating federal antitrust law in addition to breach of contract, arguing that Amazon鈥檚 actions illegally favored Twitter.  Amazon鈥檚 lawyers at Davis Wright Tremaine filed the company鈥檚 brief opposing the TRO Tuesday night. Citing scores of chilling posts by Parler users - including vivid threats of violence to politicians, social media executives, journalists, Amazon delivery drivers, even teachers 鈥?Amazon argued that it was Parler, not Amazon, that had breached their agreement. Amazon鈥檚 terms of service, the brief said, prohibit content that 鈥渧iolates the rights of others, or that may be harmful to others.鈥?If its web services customers violate those terms, Amazon said, it has the right to suspend or terminate their accounts immediately. And, according to Amazon, it gave Parler plenty of opportunity to come up with protocols to comply with Amazon rules, as an Amazon executive recounted in a redacted declaration. (Amazon said it had redacted the name of the executive for fear its employee would be attacked.) Parler鈥檚 response 鈥?an inchoate plan to use volunteers to identify dangerous posts 鈥?was inadequate, Amazon said.  Amazon also pointed to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the clause conservatives love to hate. Section 230, as you know, restricts liability for online service providers. In this case, Amazon said, it precludes Parler鈥檚 claims because Amazon acted in good faith. Under Section 230, Amazon said, it can鈥檛 be liable for acting in good faith to block violent and harassing content.  But for me, Amazon鈥檚 most interesting argument refuted Parler鈥檚 allegation that Amazon violated the Sherman Act by favoring Twitter, even though, according to Parler, Twitter鈥檚 content can be just as violent and abusive as posts on Parler. The pleading standard for federal antitrust claims, as Amazon鈥檚 Davis Wright lawyers said in their brief, is notoriously strict after the U.S. Supreme Court鈥檚 2007 ruling in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly (550 U.S. 544). Antitrust plaintiffs must plausibly allege an anticompetitive conspiracy. But Parler didn鈥檛 even allege that Amazon and Twitter ever discussed Parler, let alone that they had an agreement to squelch the right-leaning site.  Amazon provided a declaration (also redacted) from an executive who negotiated the company鈥檚 recently announced agreement with Twitter. Amazon had previously been providing web hosting services for ancillary Twitter services, like data backup and Twitter鈥檚 new Fleets feature, but not for Twitter鈥檚 main feed. Under the new agreement, announced in December, Amazon will begin hosting Twitter鈥檚 main feed at an unspecified future date. But according to the executive, the negotiations with Twitter did not touch upon Parler.  鈥淭o my knowledge, (Amazon) and Twitter have never discussed, much less agreed upon, any policy, practice, or act directed at Parler,鈥?the executive said. 鈥淭o the contrary, we have an internal policy never to discuss matters involving one customer with another customer. Nobody in my organization would be authorized to discuss Parler with Twitter without my authorization (and) I have not authorized any AWS employee to discuss Parler with Twitter.鈥? There鈥檚 also a very good reason, according to Amazon, why Amazon would not have conspired with Twitter to thwart Parler: Amazon has no motive to pick between them. It鈥檚 in the business of providing web services to any customer, regardless of political views, that鈥檚 willing to comply with its terms, its executive said in the redacted declaration.  鈥淎WS has no incentive to stop doing business with paying customers,鈥?Davis Wright wrote in Amazon鈥檚 brief. It only suspended Parler鈥檚 account, the brief said, because Parler violated Amazon鈥檚 terms by failing to offer a systemic plan to take down violent and abusive posts.  Stanford law professor Mark Lemley told my Reuters colleague Tom Rowe that Parler鈥檚 antitrust theory just doesn鈥檛 seem plausible. 鈥淚t would be one thing if there were evidence that Amazon, Twitter and Facebook conspired together to target Parler,鈥?Lemley said. 鈥淏ut Amazon acting alone isn鈥檛 an antitrust problem 鈥?Amazon has a general right to refuse to deal with anyone for any reason, or indeed no reason at all.鈥? Parler鈥檚 reply brief, filed Wednesday afternoon, argued that circumstantial evidence backs its claim that Amazon acted in the interest of Twitter, a much bigger and wealthier client than Parler. Amazon only began threatening to shut down Parler web services when users began switching en masse from Twitter to Parler, the brief said. That timing, coupled with Amazon鈥檚 tolerance for violent posts by Twitter users, suggests a conspiracy to promote Twitter at Parler鈥檚 expense.  Parler also said Amazon and Twitter had 鈥渁 clear interest in  eliminating an up-and-coming service like Parler,鈥?although the brief did not directly respond to Amazon鈥檚 argument that it鈥檚 happy to take money from any customer that complies with its terms. Parler said Amazon engaged in anticompetitive conduct by erasing its site from the microblogging market.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein will preside over a hearing on Parler鈥檚 TRO motion tomorrow.  Parler and its users are convinced there鈥檚 a double standard. As the company complained in its filings, Twitter users also post violent threats: Just the day before Amazon suspended Parler, #HangMikePence was a trending topic on Twitter. (Amazon鈥檚 brief explained that it does not currently provide web hosting services to Twitter鈥檚 main feed, so it could not have threatened suspension. It also said that Twitter subsequently blocked the hashtag.)  But Amazon鈥檚 apparently unilateral decision to boot Parler does not constitute an antitrust conspiracy. Without additional evidence, Parler鈥檚 Sherman Act claim is not going to get the site reinstated through Amazon web services."

2021/1/14,"(Reuters) - Connecticut is investigating Amazon.com Inc for potential anti-competitive behavior in its business selling digital books, the state鈥檚 attorney general said on Wednesday.

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo  The probe is one of many into the e-commerce platform鈥檚 business practices. Amazon is also under investigation by the attorneys general in New York, California and Washington state and the Federal Trade Commission.  鈥淐onnecticut has an active and ongoing antitrust investigation into Amazon regarding potentially anticompetitive terms in their e-book distribution agreements with certain publishers,鈥?Attorney General William Tong said in a statement to Reuters.  The probe comes as technology platforms face a backlash in the United States and across the world, fueled by concerns among regulators, lawmakers and consumer groups that firms have too much power and are harming users and business rivals.  Tong said his office has previously taken action against companies such as Apple Inc and a number of e-book publishers to protect competition in that market and will continue to monitor it aggressively.  An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.  Amazon enjoys a dominant market share in the e-book business, whose rivals include Barnes & Noble, Apple and Alphabet鈥檚 Google.  A scathing antitrust report in October from the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee鈥檚 antitrust panel published details of what it said was Amazon鈥檚 anti-competitive behavior and suggested barring the company from operating its online marketplace, in which it also competes. Amazon had pushed back against the report before it was released, saying that market interventions 鈥渨ould kill off independent retailers and punish consumers by forcing small businesses out of popular online stores, raising prices and reducing consumer choice.鈥? Amazon鈥檚 online marketplace has come under increasing scrutiny over how it treats sellers, gathers data from such sellers and launches competing products.  In 2012, the U.S. Justice Department alleged in an antitrust lawsuit that Apple along with five major publishers had worked together to raise prices of digital books. The publishers settled but Apple went to trial and lost."

Chinnappa/File Photo  NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has filed an appeal with an Indian court in an ongoing dispute against local partner Future Group鈥檚 plan to sell its retail assets to Reliance Industries, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.  Future Group, which operates supermarkets and high-end food stores across India, agreed to sell its retail assets to oil-to-clothes conglomerate Reliance in August for $3.4 billion but Amazon has alleged the deal breached agreements Future had made with the U.S. company in 2019.  The outcome of the dispute has implications for the future shape of India鈥檚 retail landscape, especially in deciding who will have an upper hand in the groceries market expected to be worth around $740 billion a year by 2024.  Amazon also took Future to a Singapore arbitrator, which passed an interim order in October saying the Reliance deal should be halted. The Indian retailer has maintained that order is not binding and has instead mounted another legal challenge in a New Delhi court.  In December, the Indian court left it to regulators to decide the fate of Future Group鈥檚 retail deal with Reliance, but allowed Amazon to raise objections to the sale.  In its appeal, Amazon is arguing that certain observations made by the judge in relation to the terms of the U.S. company鈥檚 2019 agreement with Future were inconsistent with the Singapore arbitrator鈥檚 order, which favoured Amazon, the source said.  The source also said Amazon is arguing in its appeal that this has allowed Future to effectively bypass the arbitration order. The appeal is due to be heard on Jan. 13.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Monday said it was working to remove some QAnon products from its online marketplace, citing policies that prohibit offensive items or other inappropriate content.  The world鈥檚 largest online retailer drew scrutiny for having apparel with QAnon insignia and related books up for sale days after QAnon followers joined last week鈥檚 siege of the U.S. Capitol, which left five people dead.  QAnon backers have pushed conspiracies on social media based on web postings from the anonymous 鈥淨,鈥?citing insider knowledge of U.S. President Donald Trump鈥檚 administration. These include the baseless claim that Trump secretly is fighting a cabal of child-sex predators, among them prominent Democrats and figures in Hollywood.  The action by Amazon follows a decision to stop hosting the web content of Parler, a social network used by some supporters of Trump. The company alleged that Parler had violated the terms of service of its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), for failing to deal with an increase in violent social media. Parler sued AWS on Monday in response.  Amazon previously has come under fire for - and removed the listings of - products promoting extremist views, such as books denying the Holocaust."

Slideshow ( 2 images )  In an antitrust complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in Seattle, Parler said Amazon delivered a 鈥渄eath blow鈥?by abruptly cutting off Web-hosting services on Sunday night, soon after Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc鈥檚 Google removed the Parler app from their own app stores.  Parler accused Amazon Web Services of hypocrisy for expressing a lack of confidence it could properly police its platform, including by removing content encouraging violence.  It said Amazon did this despite making no threats to suspend Twitter, where a recent top-trending tweet demanded to 鈥淗ang Mike Pence,鈥?the U.S. vice president.  鈥淎WS false claims have made Parler a pariah,鈥?and the Web services cutoff 鈥渋s the equivalent of pulling the plug on a hospital patient on life support,鈥?the complaint said.  Amazon said the lawsuit has no merit.  It said it respects Parler鈥檚 right to decide what content to allow, but that Parler has been 鈥渦nable or unwilling鈥?to remove the 鈥渟ignificant鈥?and growing amount of content that 鈥渆ncourages and incites violence,鈥?leading to its service suspension.  Parler wants a court order requiring Amazon to reinstate its account.  It is also seeking triple damages, saying it had over 12 million users and stood to lose millions more as conservatives encourage their Twitter followers to switch to Parler.  Twitter permanently suspended Trump鈥檚 personal account, @realDonaldTrump, on Friday night, citing the 鈥渞isk of further incitement of violence.鈥? That suspension came two days after the U.S. Capitol was stormed by a mob of Trump supporters, whose conduct Twitter said Trump appeared to condone.

The not-for-profit venture was meant to address high costs in the world鈥檚 most expensive healthcare system and to initially focus on 鈥渢ransparent鈥?healthcare for the U.S. employees of the three companies.  But the joint venture faced hurdles last year when its Chief Executive Officer Atul Gawande, a Harvard surgeon and author, stepped down to take the role of chairman.

Haven said on Monday the three companies would in the future collaborate informally to design programs tailored to address the specific needs of their own employees.  CNBC, which first reported the company was winding down, said many projects designed by Haven were executed separately by the three companies, eliminating the need for a joint venture.

2020/12/23,"Slideshow ( 3 images )  LOS ANGELES/LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon seller Bernie Thompson shifted half of his production out of China to reduce his business risks and still found himself in the crosshairs of logistical chaos besetting the movement of goods around the globe.  A surge in demand for furniture, exercise equipment and other goods for shoppers sheltering at home in a worsening COVID-19 pandemic has upended normal trade flows.  That has stranded empty cargo containers in the wrong places, spawning bottlenecks that now stretch from factories to seaports. Container ship operators ferry the majority of consumer goods, and transportation and trade sources warn that prolonged industry disruption could cause shortages and complicate the global economic recovery. Thompson, founder of Washington-based Plugable Technologies, sells work-from-home staples like laptop docking stations. He diversified sourcing to be less reliant on a single country for manufacturing and less exposed to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.  Things did not go as planned and now, like many other importers, he is concerned about keeping enough product in stock. 鈥淲e鈥檝e moved production out of China and moved ourselves right into a disadvantage,鈥?said Thompson.  His new factory in Thailand was first to suffer delays of about four weeks, in part because shipping companies routed empty containers to the top priority U.S.-China trade lane. Those logistical snags cascaded and now his remaining shipments from China - the world鈥檚 No. 1 manufacturer 鈥?are postponed by as much as three weeks. And he is not alone - U.S. retailer Costco Wholesale Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd in the United Kingdom have also suffered delays. 鈥淓veryone鈥檚 trying to squeeze through this narrow opening all at once,鈥?said Rick Woldenberg, chief executive of Illinois-based Learning Resources which supplies educational toys to Amazon.com and other major retailers.

2020/12/23,"(Reuters) - In 2021, Amazon.com Inc is poised to face a renewed challenge from groups it has long countered: unions.  Energized by protests at Amazon’s U.S. warehouses and a more labor-friendly administration assuming office, unions are campaigning at the world’s largest online retailer to see if its warehouse or grocery workers would like to join their ranks.  A major test is expected early next year when workers at one warehouse decide whether to unionize. The company has not faced a union election in the United States since 2014, and a “yes” vote would be the first ever for a U.S. Amazon facility.  Amazon, America’s second-biggest private employer behind Walmart Inc, has told workers it already offers the pay and benefits unions promise, and it has trained managers to spot organizing activity. Its operation in France offers a picture of what the company would avoid: strong unions there precipitated a month-long closure of its warehouses this year.  The upcoming vote is for associates in Amazon’s fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama; they will weigh whether to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). The organizing committee has launched a social media campaign, shared union authorization cards and collected enough to hold the election.  This week and last, the RWDSU and Amazon negotiated the election terms. By Tuesday they agreed to have seasonal workers in the bargaining unit, as well as process assistants, whose inclusion the union had questioned for their supervisory authority, according to the election hearings presided by a government labor board. That board will set the election date.  The larger the bargaining unit’s size - now expected to be over 5,700 - the more votes the union needs to win.  In a statement, Amazon said, “We don’t believe this group represents the majority of our employees’ views. Our employees choose to work at Amazon because we offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire.” Average pay at the Bessemer facility is $15.30 per hour, and jobs come with health and retirement benefits, it said.  Precedent shows the RWDSU faces an uphill battle. Union membership has fallen to 10% of the eligible workforce in 2019 from 20% in 1983, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in January.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Employees at the Alabama facility did not answer requests for an interview.  VOTE ‘WOULD PASS’  Amazon workers are organizing elsewhere, too. Alexander Collias, a cashier for Amazon’s subsidiary Whole Foods, said he has been participating in walkouts because the pandemic has put workers’ health at risk and he claims management has brushed off others concerns.  “We’re definitely extremely pro-union,” he said of his Whole Foods store in Portland. “If we had a vote today, I think it would pass.”  Courtenay Brown, a process assistant at an Amazon warehouse in New Jersey, said work has increased 10-fold in her building during the pandemic, and colleagues have fallen ill. So she’s started circulating work-related petitions via Facebook.  “We need to be able to have a voice,” said Brown, 30, adding she was neutral about the impact a union could have at her facility.  Reuters was introduced to both Brown and Collias via pro-labor groups campaigning at Amazon. One of them was Whole Worker, a group of current and former Whole Foods staff looking to organize the grocery chain.  Its strategy is to focus outreach and actions at the half dozen Whole Foods stores, including in Portland and Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, where it already has secured majority staff support, said Katie Doan, one of the group’s directors.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  “We’d rather focus on little stores here and there who are for sure going to fully unionize, rather than fail nationally,” said Doan, who worked for Whole Foods in California until earlier this year.  Likewise, representatives of the United Food and Commercial Workers International have reached out to discuss unionization, hazard pay and other issues with Whole Foods staff, according to interviews and copies of the communication shared with Reuters.  Seattle-area unions are meeting with Amazon tech workers, too, their coalition leader said. One local is helping corporate whistleblowers whom Amazon fired contest their termination as a violation of U.S. labor law, according to a public record obtained by Reuters. Amazon said it supports workers’ right to criticize the company, but the employees in question violated internal policies.  Labor advocates say the administration of President Joe Biden is poised to help with union efforts, making the U.S. National Labor Relations Board less beholden to corporate interests and supporting the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act.  That bill passed the U.S. House in February and would add penalties for companies that hinder organizing; Senate approval is far from guaranteed. Its passage would help level the playing field for workers, said Stuart Appelbaum, RWDSU president whose Mid-South Council is behind the Alabama union drive.  “With a change in administration, Amazon workers are going to have a much better chance of coming together,” he said."

2020/12/21,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - The High Court of Delhi on Monday left it to regulators to decide the fate of the $3.38 billion sale of Future Group’s retail assets to Reliance Industries Ltd, but allowed U.S. partner Amazon.com Inc to raise objections to it.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Hammered by the coronavirus pandemic, Future sold its retail assets to oil-to-clothes conglomerate Reliance in August but Amazon said the deal breached agreements Future made with the U.S. ecommerce leader in 2019.  Analysts expect the Reliance deal, which has now cleared anti-trust hurdles, to go through despite the High Court of Delhi on Monday dismissing a plea from Future to restrain Amazon - which owns a small indirect stake in Future Retail - from interfering in the transaction.  The pursuit of Future Retail Ltd has been billed as the battle of the billionaires - namely Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Reliance’s Mukesh Ambani.  If the deal with Reliance goes ahead, it will delay Amazon’s goal of capturing India’s massive groceries market that Forrester Research estimates will be worth $740 billion a year by 2024.  “The present application is disposed of ...” the court said in its written order about the Future petition.  “However, the Statutory Authorities/Regulators are directed to take the decision on the applications/objections in accordance with the law.”  Amazon emailed a one-line statement welcoming the verdict, while Future said it was consulting with legal advisors.  “It is being portrayed that just because the interim injunction has not been granted, this round has gone to Amazon, which is not true,” said Shweta Dubey, partner at legal firm SD Partners.  “There have been certain significant observations in the judgement which have put Future in a very advantageous position.”  The court said Reliance and Future’s agreement “satisfies the requirement of a valid contract”, although Justice Mukta Gupta noted in the verdict that Amazon cannot be barred from writing to regulators on account of potentially irreparable damage.  Reliance and Future dominate India’s grocery market, with the next competitor, Avenue Supermarts Ltd’s DMart, far behind in terms of stores and reach.  Future is widely credited as transforming India’s retail sector in recent decades. However, Kishore Biyani sought a buyer after its stores bore the brunt of virus related lockdowns.  “Even if money-wise Amazon can invest as much as Reliance, you will need still time to build the infrastructure on ground,” said Satish Meena, senior Forrester forecast analyst, of Amazon’s grocery ambitions in the country.  “That is something that Amazon will need to do from scratch or acquire or tie-up with other Indian grocery or retailers.”"

2020/12/10,"PARIS (Reuters) -France鈥檚 data privacy watchdog has handed out its biggest ever fine of 100 million euros ($121 million) to Alphabet鈥檚 Google for breaching the country鈥檚 rules on online advertising trackers (cookies).  FILE PHOTO: A Google sign is shown at one of the company's office complexes in Irvine, California, U.S., July 27, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Blake  The CNIL said on Thursday it had also fined e-commerce giant Amazon 35 million euros for breaking the same rules,  The regulator found the companies鈥?French websites didn鈥檛 seek the prior consent of visitors before advertising cookies - small pieces of data stored while navigating on the Web - were saved on computers, it said in a statement.  Google and Amazon also failed to provide clear information to internet users about how the firms intended to make use of such online trackers and how visitors to their French websites could refuse any use of the cookies, the watchdog said.  The CNIL rejected the companies鈥?arguments that it had no right to impose the sanctions because their respective European headquarters are in Ireland and Luxembourg - two countries perceived by some data privacy advocacy groups as being lenient toward Silicon Valley companies.  The CNIL said Google鈥檚 fine had to be paid for the most part by its U.S. entity Google LLC (60 million euros) and the rest by EU-based Google Ireland Limited (40 million).  Amazon鈥檚 fine has to be paid by its Luxembourg-based entity.  The CNIL said the companies had three months to change the information banners. If they fail to do so, they will face an additional fine of 100,000 euros per day until they comply.  The financial penalty against Google is the biggest ever issued by the CNIL, a spokesman for the watchdog said.  The previous record fine of 50 million euros also targeted the U.S. tech giant for breaching EU data privacy rules.  鈥淲e stand by our record of providing upfront information and clear controls, strong internal data governance, secure infrastructure, and above all, helpful products,鈥?Google said in a statement.  鈥淭oday鈥檚 decision under French ePrivacy laws overlooks these efforts and doesn鈥檛 account for the fact that French rules and regulatory guidance are uncertain and constantly evolving.鈥?

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo  OSLO (Reuters) - Amazon has signed a 10-year offshore wind power purchase agreement (PPA) with Danish renewables firm Orsted, they said in a joint statement on Thursday.  The U.S. tech and online retail giant, which plans to source 100% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, will take 250 megawatt (MW) of output from Orsted鈥檚 planned 900 MW Borkum Riffgrund 3 wind farm in the German North Sea, the firms said.  The deal brings Borkum Riffgrund 3 a step closer to being built, said Orsted, the world鈥檚 biggest offshore wind power operator.  The Danish company said it will make a final investment decision for the subsidy-free wind farm at the end of 2021, with operation then scheduled for 2025, but did not provide financial details.  In December 2019, Orsted signed a 10-year fixed-price PPA with polymer producer Covestro, which will take 100 MW from Borkum Riffgrund 3.  Over the past 12 months, the Danish firm had concluded corporate PPAs for an accumulated capacity of 1,301 MW across its global offshore wind portfolio, it said.  PPAs have become a key part of renewable energy project development, providing a reliable revenue stream for asset owners as governments have closed or are closing subsidy schemes as wind and solar power technologies mature.  They typically involve the owner of an asset selling their power to a third party or directly to a consumer.  The Amazon deal did not change Orsted鈥檚 previous financial guidance for the financial year 2020, it said."

The growth of e-pharmacies, however, has left many Indian trader groups feeling threatened, who say online drugstores can contribute to medicine sales without proper verification and the entry of large players can cause unemployment in the sector.  Amazon’s plan to further expand in India also comes close on the heels of its launch of an online pharmacy to deliver prescription drugs in the United States, increasing competition with drug retailers such as Walgreens, CVS Health and Walmart."
2020/12/4,"PARIS (Reuters) - Climate activists piled up giant cardboard delivery boxes outside the finance ministry in Paris on Friday, protesting against Amazon鈥檚 expansion in France as the online retailer launched a delayed 鈥淏lack Friday鈥?sales drive.

The campaigners view the U.S. retail giant as a prime factor in the urbanisation of farmland, a process they say is contributing significantly to climate change and the loss of environmental biodiversity.  Amazon鈥檚 global revenues have soared during the pandemic and its ability to keep selling during coronavirus lockdowns has deepened frustration among French opponents, who say it represents a U.S.-style mass consumer culture at odds with a long local tradition of neighborhood stores.  A lengthy battle over safety measures this spring led to the temporary closure of Amazon鈥檚 French warehouses.  Last month, under government pressure, it postponed its Black Friday campaign from Nov. 27 to Dec. 4 to help shopkeepers struggling during France鈥檚 second national lockdown. They were allowed to re-open on Nov. 28 but restaurants and bars remain closed.

The online retailer and similar firms were responsible for 鈥渏ust a few percent鈥?of the urbanisation process and were creating many jobs, he told BFM TV.

Speaking at the company鈥檚 annual re:Invent conference, executive Andy Jassy announced Amazon Connect Voice ID, which uses machine learning software to authenticate customers who dial into call centers.  Jassy, who runs the firm鈥檚 cloud computing division Amazon Web Services, said AWS builds a voice print for customers who opt in to save time on calls. Enterprises using the service set how confident it needs to be for authentication to be automatic, or for requiring manual confirmation of a customer鈥檚 account.  Amazon is also adding a machine learning tool that helps call-center agents find answers for customers and another that help them personalize service.  The news reflects rising demand for Amazon鈥檚 cloud - and for call-center tools in particular.

A woman shops inside the Big Bazaar retail store in Mumbai, India, November 25, 2020. REUTERS/Niharika Kulkarni  The outcome of a legal dispute which has embroiled the billionaires鈥?Amazon.com and Reliance Industries Ltd empires - where a court ruling is imminent - may shape India鈥檚 retail landscape for years to come.  The winner in the fight for Future Retail Ltd, Amazon鈥檚 estranged local partner, will get pole position in the race to meet the daily needs of more than a billion people.  Accusations of insider trading and contractual breaches, as well as nationalistic cries to keep the U.S. giant at bay, mark the high-stakes fight, which has snowballed from what began as a dispute between Amazon and Future.  If Amazon succeeds, it may slow Reliance鈥檚 plans to expand its e-commerce and brick-and-mortar operations. If Amazon loses, its hopes of expanding its interests in India鈥檚 second-largest retailer and cashing in on its key grocery supply chain will be dashed, industry insiders say.  Amazon is trying to stop Reliance鈥檚 $3.4 billion purchase of Future Group鈥檚 retail assets. The U.S. company, which won an injunction from an arbitrator to block the Reliance-Future deal, accuses its partner of breaching some pre-existing agreements, misleading the public and insider trading. Future denies the allegations.  Amazon, Reliance and Future did not respond to requests for comment.  Bezos鈥檚 behemoth is a formidable foe, but Ambani has a history as a disrupter. He has shaken foreign telecom firms by offering dirt-cheap data. Industry executives see his e-commerce plans as a threat for Amazon and Walmart Inc鈥檚 Flipkart.  鈥淚f Reliance moves faster and faster, obviously it鈥檒l become very difficult for anyone else to gain,鈥?said Himanshu Bajaj, head of consulting firm Kearney鈥檚 India retail practice.  Reliance, seeking to expand its JioMart e-commerce business, this month completed a $6.4 billion fund-raising by selling a stake in its retail arm to such investors as Silver Lake Partners and KKR & Co.  GROCERIES, 鈥楤IG BROTHER鈥?IN AMERICA  India鈥檚 retail market will grow 46% over the next four years to an annual $1.3 trillion, reckons Forrester Research. The key battle is over groceries, expected to be worth around $740 billion a year by 2024.  Founded by Kishore Biyani, dubbed India鈥檚 retail king, Future transformed the country鈥檚 retailing in recent decades, before COVID-19 hit the business so hard this year that Biyani was forced to find a new buyer.  Around 1,300 of Future鈥檚 more than 1,700 retail outlets in 400 cities sell groceries. Its budget supermarkets cater to middle-class shoppers, while its upmarket stores offer products like imported cheese and fresh guacamole, relatively rare in India鈥檚 retail landscape.  That makes Future a prized asset for both Reliance and Amazon.  Reliance and Future dominate the market, with the next competitor, Avenue Supermarts Ltd鈥檚 DMart, having just 220 outlets in around 70 cities.  While Reliance boasts around 11,000 retail stores, just 800 of those offer food and groceries, UBS estimates. Future鈥檚 retail assets would nearly triple Reliance鈥檚 footprint in the grocery segment and boost its e-commerce plans, said Forrester analyst Satish Meena.  Amazon sees Future as a long-term play to optimise its supply chain for grocery delivery, an area where it has lagged, Meena said.  鈥淕rocery is the category in which you fight,鈥?he said, while losing Future to Reliance would 鈥渟low Amazon鈥?  Amazon, Future and Reliance this month hired some of India鈥檚 top lawyers, who argued at length before a New Delhi judge. She is expected to decide soon whether to restrain Amazon from approaching regulators to block the Future-Reliance deal.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Future Retail - one of country’s top retailers - has been locked in a bitter dispute with Amazon over its $3.4 billion retail assets deal with Reliance Industries. Amazon is a business partner of Future and argues the Indian firm’s asset sale breached some of their pre-existing agreements.  Amazon had complained to stock exchanges, accusing Future of misleading public by making incorrect market disclosures, allegations the Indian group denies.  The complaint came after Amazon on Oct. 25 won an injunction from an arbitrator to halt the Future-Reliance deal.  Previously unreported e-mails exchanged between the NSE and Future show the stock exchange repeatedly requested the company submit more details of the arbitration order, seeking details of possible impact on financials, lenders and the Reliance deal.  On Oct. 27, NSE asked Future why it had not disclosed the commencement of the arbitration proceedings and not shared the impact of the order. Future in response said it believed a disclosure wasn’t required.  NSE’s listing compliance division rejected that argument. It demanded a series of disclosures be made within hours, “failing which appropriate actions may be initiated”, the emails showed.  Future Retail’s Company Secretary, Virendra Samani, answered most of NSE’s queries in a late night e-mail on Oct. 30, saying it was doing so “in the best interest of all stakeholders”, the communications showed.  Many of those responses were made public on directions of the NSE two days later in a six-page exchange filing by Future.  Before that, Future had only submitted a disclosure on Oct. 26 in which it attached a media release saying it would ensure its deal with Reliance proceeded unhindered and that it was reviewing the arbitration order.  The NSE and Future Retail did not respond to requests for comment.  The legal dispute has now reached the Delhi High Court, where Future Retail has urged the court to stop Amazon from writing letters to regulators to block its Reliance deal, which is pending approvals from the market regulator and stock exchanges. The judge is expected to rule on the plea in the coming days.  Amazon had separately asked India’s market regulator to investigate Future for insider trading, saying it disclosed to Reliance price sensitive details of the arbitration order before its exchange filing in late October.  Future has said its communications with Reliance, which is led by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, were for a “legitimate purpose”.  NSE in e-mails at least twice asked Future Retail to provide a copy of the arbitration order to vet the disclosures, and also why it should not be disclosed as material price-sensitive information, emails between Oct. 27 and Oct. 30 showed.  Future’s Samani at first declined the request, stating in an e-mail that the order was “confidential in nature” and sharing further information could be “deterimental” to the company. A copy was provided following NSE’s warning."
2020/11/25,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc鈥檚 widely used cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is experiencing a large-scale outage, the company said on Wednesday, affecting users ranging from websites to software providers.  It has also affected the ability to post updates to its service health dashboard, the company said.  鈥淜inesis has been experiencing increased error rates this morning in our US-East-1 Region that鈥檚 impacted some other AWS services. We are working toward resolution,鈥?an AWS spokesperson said in a statement.  Amazon Kinesis, a part of its cloud offerings, collects, processes and analyzes real-time data and offers insights.  Video-streaming device maker Roku Inc, Adobe鈥檚 Spark platform, video-hosting website Flickr and the Baltimore Sun newspaper were among those hit by the outage, according to their recent posts on Twitter.  ""We are experiencing intermittent issues with our website and publishing system because of the AWS outage,"" the newspaper tweeted here.  Amazon鈥檚 cloud service business is thriving on higher demand from companies switching to virtual offices due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Sales from AWS, which sells data storage and computing power in the cloud, rose about 29% in the third quarter."
2020/11/25,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Trade union Verdi called on workers at seven German Amazon warehouses to go on a three-day strike that will coincide with 鈥淏lack Friday鈥?discount shopping sales on Nov. 27.  Scheduled to begin with Wednesday鈥檚 night shift, Verdi is demanding better pay and working conditions. Verdi has been organising strikes at Amazon in Germany - the company鈥檚 biggest market after the United States - since 2013, most recently last month during its 鈥淧rime Day鈥?promotional event.  An Amazon spokesman said at the time that the company offered 鈥渆xcellent鈥?salaries, with benefits and working conditions comparable with other important employers.  The U.S. retail giant has seen sales soar globally as restrictions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus sent consumers online, making it difficult for some bricks-and-mortar shops to compete.  Verdi argues this has strengthened the case for higher wages, adding workers were not sufficiently protected against the spread of the coronavirus.  Last week, Amazon bowed to government pressure in France to postpone its local Black Friday event by a week to help local shopkeepers struggling with a nationwide lockdown."
2020/11/24,"FILE PHOTO: German Economic Cooperation and Development Minister Gerd Mueller attends the weekly cabinet meeting at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany September 16, 2020. Michael Sohn/Pool via REUTERS  BERLIN (Reuters) - Companies that have benefitted from the coronavirus crisis, such as Amazon and drugmakers, should join wealthy countries in helping to fund access to vaccines for poorer nations, Germany鈥檚 international development minister said on Tuesday.  Herculean research efforts have seen several promising vaccines reach the brink of approval in recent weeks. But with richer countries ordering up supplies, concerns have grown that poorer nations will miss out.  Gerd Mueller, Germany鈥檚 development minister, said it should not only be richer governments trying to make sure the developing world gets its fair share.  鈥淧rivate companies that have particularly profited from the coronavirus crisis, like Amazon or the pharmaceuticals companies also have an obligation,鈥?he told Reuters.  On Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was concerned that not enough had been done to ensure adequate supplies of the new vaccines were available to poorer states, even as European governments and the United States snapped up supplies.  Pharmaceutical firms should offer the World Health Organization鈥檚 COVAX initiative - designed to make available supplies to poorer countries - 鈥渢he best possible conditions and good prices鈥?for their vaccines, Mueller said."

The approval by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) is a setback for U.S. giant Amazon, which has argued that a 2019 agreement it inked with Future prevented the Indian group from selling its retail assets to certain parties, including Reliance - led by Asia鈥檚 richest man, Mukesh Ambani.  Amazon - an investor in one of Future鈥檚 holding companies - last month won an injunction against the deal from an arbitrator in Singapore.  Amazon has also approached the CCI and the country鈥檚 market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), urging them to consider the arbitration order and not approve the deal.  Future Retail, however, said the agreement in question was not with the company, but with the company鈥檚 largest shareholder and the arbitration order was not valid in India. It has also taken Amazon to court in an effort to prevent it from sending letters to regulators."

Amazon had approached the CCI and the country鈥檚 market regulator SEBI alleging the deal would violate some pre-existing agreements it had with Future Group.  Last month Amazon won an injunction from a Singapore arbitrator to halt the deal pending arbitration.  Amazon, Future and Reliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  While the deal is yet to receive approval of stock exchanges and market regulator SEBI, the three companies are now embroiled in a legal battle at the Delhi High Court over the transaction.  An Indian antitrust lawyer said the CCI only looks into competition issues around a deal and is not concerned with other disputes between parties.  鈥淚t鈥檚 (CCI) not a regulator which approves the transaction as such,鈥?the lawyer said.  Amazon says its 2019 deal with a Future Group subsidiary included clauses saying it could not sell its retail assets to certain parties, including Reliance.  Future has argued it entered into the deal with Reliance because its retail business was severely hit during the COVID-19 pandemic and it was critical to protect all its stakeholders.  The dispute has put Amazon at odds not just with Future Retail - one of country鈥檚 top retailers - but also with Ambani鈥檚 Reliance Group which is fast expanding its e-commerce business and threatening the dominance of the U.S. giant."
2020/11/20,"LONDON (Reuters) - A pilot by online giant Amazon and two stock exchanges showed how moving share trading from costly physical servers to cloud computing could save money and reduce the potential for outages, the companies said on Friday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Singapore Exchange SGX, London-based Aquis Exchange and Amazon Web Services said they undertook a proof of concept to show that trading shares in the cloud can be sufficiently fast and reliable.  鈥淚t鈥檚 proven to be technically capable,鈥?said Adrian Ip, a director at Aquis Exchange鈥檚 technology arm.  Exchanges using the cloud to date for trading are limited in size or niche, such as dealing in crypto assets, Ip said.  Amazon鈥檚 move into 鈥渕ulticast鈥?or an ability to send data to many parties at the same time in the cloud, a key requirement for any exchange of size, was a breakthrough, Ip said.  Despite exchanges spending millions of dollars on physical back-up servers, there have been outages this year in Japan, Australia, and at Euronext in Europe, drawing close scrutiny from regulators.  A cloud-based exchange could be more resilient than relying on physical infrastructure dotted across regions, Ip said.  Mayumi Hiramatsu, Vice President at Amazon Web Services, said the pilot showed a path to free up customers from maintaining legacy on-premises infrastructure.  Aquis and SGX are looking at how to take forward findings from their pilot with Amazon, which they say could bring savings of up to 90%.  鈥淲e will be looking at how this can be scaled globally. We will take a considered and measured approach and discuss with regulators and members,鈥?Ip said.  It comes at a time when regulators globally are also taking a harder look at how financial firms are increasingly relying on third party cloud providers like Amazon, Google and Microsoft for critical services.  The European Union aims to be the first to introduce new laws to regulate such use of the cloud."

The features let consumers purchase a present online and have it delivered to the recipient with, for example, the retailer handling wrapping, a personal message or a receipt that does not show the gift’s price.  Amazon’s rivals have tried to chip away at its online preeminence, spending millions to fulfill orders faster, expand product catalogs and, in some cases, provide free shipping and even subscription services. But the first holiday sales season with widespread coronavirus has drawn attention to a previously overlooked battlefront: gift giving.  Consumers flocked to Walmart and other retailers early in the pandemic when Amazon was at times slow to deliver essentials including toilet paper. Now, Amazon competitors see another opportunity to seize market share.  “This is an area of opportunity where smaller or large retailers could differentiate given most consumers will be doing their holiday shopping online this year,” said Bobby Figueroa, who worked for Amazon’s ad sales unit before founding retail analytics startup Gradient.  Walmart.com on Oct. 28 added a “gift eligible” label on hundreds of thousands of U.S. product pages, including for toilet paper, a status previously not displayed until checkout. Gift eligible means Walmart can send gift receipts as well as let shoppers customize an email greeting. It will also ship the item in its boxes, concealing manufacturer packaging.  With gift giving already up over last year, Walmart increased inventory of laptops, loungewear and exercise equipment ahead of the holidays. Shoppers can search specifically for only gift-eligible items for the first time.  BestBuy.com in mid-October added an option for gift receipts with store pickups. It also started allowing shoppers to arrange for Best Buy to email gift recipients with a festive greeting on the same day items are delivered.

The guide, which included new sections for items from small and Black-owned businesses, was Amazon’s largest ever.  The company has long provided basic gift features. It charges several dollars to gift-wrap shipments, and a free message of up to 240 characters per item can be printed on black-and-white gift receipts.

2020/11/19,"PARIS (Reuters) - Amazon has bowed to government pressure to postpone its 鈥淏lack Friday鈥?discount shopping sales in France to help local shopkeepers struggling with a nationwide lockdown.  The U.S. retail giant has seen sales soar globally as restrictions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus sent consumers online, making it difficult for some bricks-and-mortar shops to compete.  To level the playing field, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire this week called on supermarkets and online retailers to postpone Black Friday, which runs from Nov. 27 to Nov. 29, as shops selling non-essential goods would have to remain closed during lockdown.  Competition from Amazon first prompted European retailers to adopt the U.S. tradition of making Black Friday - the day after U.S. Thanksgiving - the kickoff to the holiday shopping season.  Amazon France Chief Executive Frederic Duval said on Thursday the company would push the event back to Dec. 4, joining other retailers such as European market leader Carrefour and France鈥檚 Leclerc.  鈥淲e have decided to delay the date of Black Friday if this can help shopkeepers reopen before Dec. 1,鈥?Duval said on TF1 television on Thursday.  Amazon confirmed Duval鈥檚 comments in an emailed statement, but did not respond to requests for further comment on Friday.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Online and traditional retailers unanimously agreed on Friday to push back Black Friday sales by a week on condition stores would be allowed to reopen by then, the Finance Ministry said after a meeting with sector representatives.  While helping to generate record profits, the coronavirus crisis has also triggered scrutiny of Amazon鈥檚 efforts to protect staff from the pandemic, particularly in France, where a lengthy battle over safety measures led to the temporary closure of warehouses.  Amazon鈥檚 ability to keep selling during the lockdown has also deepened frustration among opponents of the company in France who say it represents a U.S.-style consumer culture at odds with the country鈥檚 long tradition of mom-and-pop neighborhood stores.  Some 30,000 people have signed an online petition to boycott Amazon, according to its organiser, lawmaker Mathieu Orphelin, who left President Emmanuel Macron鈥檚 party last year to set up a more environmentally focused party.  鈥淎 lot of people use our name to get noticed, but Amazon makes up only 1% of retail in France,鈥?Duval said, when asked on France Info radio on Friday how to explain negative sentiment against his company.  President Emmanuel Macron has said France鈥檚 second national lockdown, which started on Oct. 30, would last at least four weeks. Curbs include the closure of non-essential stores, restaurants and bars.  But with recent data showing France on track to rein in a surge in coronavirus infections, the government is under pressure from shops and businesses to ease restrictions at the end of November in time for the Christmas shopping season, when many retailers make the bulk of their annual turnover.  Eager to keep shoppers from crowding stores to swoop on potential discounts, the finance ministry said on Thursday that a one-week delay in Black Friday sales would help ensure shops reopen in France under maximum safety conditions."

REUTERS/Adriano Machado  BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Tuesday his government in coming days will name countries that are importing wood illegally extracted from the Amazon.  Addressing a BRICS summit of big developing economies, Bolsonaro said Brazilian police had developed a way of tracking wood exported from the Amazon using isotopes.  鈥淲e will be revealing countries that have been importing illegal logging from the Amazon,鈥?he said, adding: 鈥淪ome of these countries are the most severe critics of my government regarding this Amazon region.鈥? Deforestation in Brazil鈥檚 Amazon rainforest has surged under the right-wing president, who argues for more mining, farming and economic development there and has played down forest fires.  Destruction of the Amazon in 2020 continues to be far higher than the years prior to Bolsonaro assuming office last year.  During his remote address to leaders from China, Russia, India and South Africa, Bolsonaro also criticized broader multilateral forums and defended reforms at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Health Organization (WHO).  Bolsonaro, a virus skeptic and a critic of WHO鈥檚 social distancing guidelines, said the virus was politicized and that the pandemic and economic crisis should be addressed together."

REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O on Thursday said it shifted part of the computing for its Alexa voice assistant to its own custom-designed chips, aiming to make the work faster and cheaper while moving it away from chips supplied by Nvidia Corp NVDA.O.  When users of devices such as Amazon鈥檚 Echo line of smart speakers ask the voice assistant a question, the query is sent to one of Amazon鈥檚 data centers for several steps of processing. When Amazon鈥檚 computers spit out an answer, that reply is in a text format that must be translated into audible speech for the voice assistant.  Amazon previously handled that computing using chips from Nvidia but now the 鈥渕ajority鈥?of it will happen using its own 鈥淚nferentia鈥?computing chip. First announced in 2018, the Amazon chip is custom designed to speed up large volumes of machine learning tasks such as translating text to speech or recognizing images.  Cloud computing customers such as Amazon, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alpahbet Inc's GOOGL.O Google have become some of the biggest buyers of computing chips, driving booming data center sales at Intel Corp INTC.O, Nvidia and others.  But major technology companies are increasingly ditching traditional silicon providers to design their own chips. Apple on Tuesday introduced its first Mac computers with its own central processors, moving away from Intel chips. [nL1N2HW1WF}  Amazon said the shift to the Infertia chip for some of its Alexa work has resulted in 25% better latency, which is a measure of speed, at a 30% lower cost.  Amazon has also said that 鈥淩ekognition,鈥?its cloud-based facial recognition service, has started to adopt its own Inferentia chips. However, the company did not say which chips the facial recognition service had previously used or how much of the work had shifted to its own chips.  The service has come under scrutiny from civil rights groups because of its use by law enforcement. Amazon in June put a one-year moratorium its use by police after the killing of George Floyd."

2020/11/11,"(Corrects to remove reference to Taylor Swift in paragraph 6)  HANGZHOU, China, Nov 11 (Reuters) - China鈥檚 Alibaba said orders made through its e-commerce sites during its Singles鈥?Day shopping extravaganza had exceeded $56 billion by Wednesday morning, as lockdown-weary consumers splashed out on as many as 16 million discounted products.  The world鈥檚 biggest sales event - eclipsing Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States combined - stretches over four main days this year, and so far has brought sellers on Alibaba platforms 16 times as many orders by value than Amazon.com Inc clocked last month in its two-day global Prime Day.  The performance will likely come as a relief to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd a week since it lost about 10% of its market value after regulators pulled the listing of financial technology affiliate Ant Group.  The sale also comes amid an economic rebound with the spread of the novel coronavirus in China under control, while border closures abroad have meant more consumers spending at home. Such is its size that its performance is widely considered indicative of the strength of China鈥檚 post-virus recovery.  Alibaba, which launched the shopping event in 2009, began the sale early this year to give lesser-known brands more exposure. It scheduled primary discount days for Nov. 1 through Nov. 3 as well as the usual Nov. 11, and will calculate gross merchandise volume (GMV) over the 11 days, rather than 24 hours.  The event is usually a splashy affair accompanied by live performances, with Katy Perry appearing this year at Alibaba鈥檚 gala late on Tuesday, albeit via livestream.  As well as simple percentage discounts from regular prices, Alibaba encourages shoppers across its numerous platforms to play mobile games, combine purchases across shops and place orders in the sale鈥檚 first few hours to get the best deals.  As of 12:30 a.m. local time (1630 GMT) on Nov. 11, GMV had surpassed 372.3 billion yuan ($56.3 billion) with orders peaking at a record 583,000 per second, Alibaba said. Over 2 million products featured in the sale for the first time - double last year, when GMV for Nov. 11 reached a record $38.4 billion.  Over 340 firms, including Apple Inc, L鈥橭real SA , Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Nike Inc , have exceeded 100 million yuan in sales, and 13 brands have recorded GMV above 1 billion yuan, Alibaba said.  Rivals JD.com Inc and Pinduoduo Inc as well as firms such as Douyin - the Chinese version of Beijing ByteDance Technology Co Ltd鈥檚 TikTok - are also holding events for Singles鈥?Day, which falls on the 11th day of the 11th month.  JD.com, which started Singles鈥?Day promotions on Nov. 1, said it recorded 200 billion yuan worth of sales within nine minutes of midnight on Wednesday, while electronics retailer Suning.com Co Ltd - part-owned by Alibaba - said it made 5 billion yuan in sales within the first 19 minutes.  BOON FOR LUXURY  Singles鈥?Day was trending on China鈥檚 Twitter-like Weibo, while a poll of Singles鈥?Day spending by Sina Entertainment found 44% of 174,000 respondents aimed to spend less than 1,000 yuan versus 4% who planned to splurge over 10,000 yuan.  Still, analysts expect this year to be a boon for luxury brands, as Chinese consumers accustomed to going overseas to buy high-end goods are stuck at home due to border closures.  鈥淭he lack of consumer tourism which has hit European and U.S. stalwarts like Harrods, Galeries Lafayette and Nordstroms will likely see bigger spending locally,鈥?retail analyst Andy Halliwell at consultancy Publicis Sapient said in a client note.  Livestreaming with telegenic hosts hawking products in real-time was a common feature of this year鈥檚 Singles鈥?Day, continuing a trend which started about two years ago.  At a building close to Alibaba鈥檚 Hangzhou headquarters, where rooms had been converted into filming studios, dozens of livestreamers chatted incessantly to viewers about Singles鈥?Day promotions and the merits of the goods they were selling.  Luo Lima, who sells diapers and other maternity products, estimated she had been on camera for 24 hours over the course of this year鈥檚 sales period, versus six hours on Singles鈥?Day two years ago.  鈥淲e stream continuously for six hours, with no break,鈥?she said. 鈥淏asically we start by eating a full meal, and getting in a good state of mind.

2020/11/10,"Nov 10 (Reuters) - The European Commission is expected to file formal antitrust charges against Amazon.com Inc on Tuesday over its dual role as a marketplace for merchants and as a retailer competing to sell the same products, according to a source familiar with the matter.  EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager has scheduled a 1230 CET (1130 GMT) news conference without specifying the subject.  The Financial Times earlier reported that Vestager will announce formal antitrust charges against Amazon on Tuesday over how it uses data about the merchants on its platform.

2020/11/10,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union charged Amazon AMZN.O with damaging retail competition, alleging on Tuesday that the U.S. company uses its size, power and data to gain an unfair advantage over smaller merchants that sell on its online platform.  The move by competition chief Margrethe Vestager, the latest European salvo against U.S. tech giants, comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified Amazon鈥檚 role in the global economy, with online sales soaring in lockdowns.  The European Commission has been investigating Amazon鈥檚 position as both a marketplace for merchants and a rival seller, while the firm also faces scrutiny in the United States over its alleged mistreatment of sellers, as well as its dual role.  The EU regulator looked into how Amazon collects data on competitors that sell on its platform, offering everything from electronics and toys to food and kitchenware. It says that Amazon uses that sensitive information, which shows what is proving popular or not, to better target its own products.  鈥淭he use of these data allows Amazon to focus on the sale of the best-selling products and it marginalises third-party sellers and caps their ability to grow,鈥?European Competition Commissioner Vestager told a news conference.  Vestager, who has a reputation of being one of the world鈥檚 toughest antitrust enforcers, said that regulators had to ensure that dual-role platforms with market power, such as Amazon, did not distort competition.  Amazon disagreed with the EU assertions.  鈥淎mazon represents less than 1% of the global retail market, and there are larger retailers in every country in which we operate,鈥?the company said.  A U.S. Congressional antitrust report earlier this year into the alleged abuse of market power by Amazon also raised the concerns highlighted by the EU and is likely to influence the case U.S. regulators bring against the company.  U.S. Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat and the top antitrust lawmaker in the House, applauded the EU and urged the U.S. Federal Trade Commision to take similar action.  鈥淎s we found as part of a 16-month bipartisan investigation, Amazon has monopoly power over sellers on its platform,鈥?Cicilline said.  The EU charges are the latest example of how watchdogs around the world, led by Europe, are grappling with the challenges of regulating Big Tech, companies that have achieved dominance in their fields and vast troves of user data.  On Vestager鈥檚 watch, the EU has imposed large fines on Alphabet鈥檚 Google and other companies. See FACTBOX:  FILE PHOTO: Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo  A final EU decision could come next year. Amazon faces being fined up to 10% of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching antitrust rules. However it can avoid a hefty penalty and a finding of wrongdoing by offering concessions to settle.  NEW INVESTIGATION  The EU competition enforcer has been investigating Amazon since July last year after rival traders voiced their grievances. The regulator said the charges related to Amazon鈥檚 activities in France and Germany, its two biggest markets in Europe and where it is the dominant player.  The case focuses on its use of merchant data on its platform. Vestager said her officials had trawled 80 million transactions and reviewed 100 million products on Amazon鈥檚 platform to put the case together.  The European Commission also opened a new investigation into Amazon on Tuesday, over the possible preferential treatment of its own retail offers and those of marketplace sellers that use Amazon鈥檚 logistics and delivery services.  That probe will look into the possible preferential treatment of Amazon鈥檚 own retail offers and those of marketplace sellers that use Amazon鈥檚 logistics and delivery services.  Regulators will investigate the criteria the company uses to select winners of its 鈥渂uy box鈥? which allows customers to add items from a specific retailer directly into their shopping carts.  鈥淚ts rules should not artificially favour Amazon鈥檚 own retail offers or advantage the offers of retailers using Amazon鈥檚 logistics and delivery services,鈥?Vestager said, citing the importance of e-commerce, an area which has gained importance with the COVID-19 pandemic."

The expansion, which adds 75,000 square meters (807,000 square feet) of distribution space, is Amazon鈥檚 biggest since it began operating in Brazil in 2012. It will create 1,500 direct jobs, the company said in a statement.

Despite the gradual easing of the measures, the migration to digital sales has continued.  Last week, MercadoLibre Inc MELI.O, Latin America's e-commerce leader, announced that its net revenue in the region soared nearly 150% in the third quarter, measured in local currencies.

Amazon is locked in a bitter legal dispute with Future Group, which in August sold its retail assets to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd. The deal breaches agreements made in 2019 by Future, according to the U.S. online retailer.  Amazon last month won an injunction to halt Future鈥檚 deal with Reliance from a Singapore arbitrator both sides had agreed to use in case of disputes. Future later said the order wasn鈥檛 binding, prompting Amazon to lodge a complaint with India鈥檚 market regulator.  The Delhi High Court was asked on Saturday to block Amazon from 鈥渕isusing鈥?the arbitration order to interfere in the Reliance deal, Future said in a filing to the stock exchange.  While further details about the challenge were not disclosed, the filing said it had made all entities who were part of the arbitration proceedings as parties to its latest suit, but was seeking relief only against Amazon.  Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The dispute has strained Amazon鈥檚 ties with one of India鈥檚 leading retailers as well as with Ambani, Asia鈥檚 richest man, and his Reliance group, which is fast expanding its e-commerce business and is a potential rival to Amazon.  Amazon says its 2019 deal in which it invested nearly $200 million in a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group could not sell its retail assets to anyone on a 鈥渞estricted persons鈥?list, which included Reliance.  Future has said the deal with Reliance was critical to rescue its ailing retail business which has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic."

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse  (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc HON.N on Friday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and forecast current-quarter earnings above estimates as cost controls and strong demand for its warehouse automation equipment partially offset poor sales in its main aerospace business.  The COVID-19 pandemic brought air travel to a virtual halt earlier in the year, hurting aero parts makers such as Honeywell, but a surge in online shopping has boosted sales at its warehouse automation equipment unit, which counts Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O among its customers.  Honeywell, which has furloughed workers, axed merit increases and cut board and executive pay, said it expects to return to growth and margin expansion in 2021.

The health crisis has also boosted demand for personal protection equipment for industrial workers, Honeywell said.  The company expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share between $1.97 and $2.02, above analysts鈥?estimate of $1.88.

2020/10/29,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O on Thursday forecast a jump in holiday sales - and costs related to COVID-19 - as consumers continued to shop more online during the pandemic.  A company executive added that heightened spending on delivery infrastructure would likely continue over years, and shares fell 2% in after-hours trading.  Since the start of the virus outbreak in the United States eight months ago, consumers have turned increasingly to Amazon for delivery of groceries, home goods and medical supplies. Brick-and-mortar shops closed their doors; Amazon by contrast moved to recruit over 400,000 workers and earned $6.3 billion in the just-ended quarter, its second consecutive record profit.  That has kept the world鈥檚 largest online retailer at the center of workplace and political tumult. Democratic politicians this month accused Amazon of holding 鈥渕onopoly power鈥?over merchants on its platform, which the company disputes. Meanwhile, more than 19,000 of Amazon鈥檚 U.S. employees contracted COVID-19, and some staff protested for site closures.  Amazon鈥檚 response now includes an estimated $4 billion in costs related to COVID-19 this holiday, up from $2.5 billion last quarter. It is testing employees for the virus and getting protective gear for new hires. It also is working less productively because of social distancing at its warehouses, which accounts for a big part of its pandemic expense, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters.  Amazon forecast operating profit to be between $1.0 billion and $4.5 billion, short of $5.8 billion analysts were looking for, according to research firm FactSet.  Competition this holiday remains fierce for the company in retail - and in the cloud. A traditional bright spot, cloud computing division Amazon Web Services (AWS) is dueling with smaller rival Microsoft Corp MSFT.O for business with a big potential during the pandemic, from remote work to cloud-based gaming.  FILE PHOTO: The Amazon logo is seen at the Amazon fulfilment center in Bretigny-sur-Orge near Paris, France, October 22, 2019. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol  In the just-ended third quarter, AWS sales grew 29%, while Microsoft reported a 48% rise in revenue for its Azure cloud.  鈥楾IGHT ON CAPACITY鈥? Still, Amazon鈥檚 sales are shaping up to hit a record level. Jeff Bezos, Amazon鈥檚 chief executive and richest person in the world, said in a press release, 鈥淲e鈥檙e seeing more customers than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts, which is just one of the signs that this is going to be an unprecedented holiday season.鈥? The company reported that customers in its loyalty club Prime were shopping more often, renewing their membership at higher rates and, internationally, turning to Amazon much more for video entertainment. Merchants also expanded their budgets for advertising on Amazon in the third quarter versus a contraction during the pandemic鈥檚 spring peak.  The question for some analysts has been whether Amazon鈥檚 consumer division can keep up with still-growing purchases during the pandemic.  The company has long worked to avoid a repeat of the 2013 season when delays left some without presents on Christmas Day. Amazon now handles more deliveries in house, and this year it moved its marketing event Prime Day - usually in July - to October, letting customers place holiday orders early.  CFO Olsavsky told reporters that the company is 鈥渘ot totally insulated鈥?from challenges its delivery partners may be facing this quarter, though the online retailer feels ready for the holiday season.  鈥淲e do think it will be tight on capacity industry-wide, and we鈥檙e no exception to that,鈥?he said. 鈥淚t does behoove shoppers to shop early.鈥? Olsavsky said on a call with analysts that Amazon鈥檚 fulfillment and logistics square footage would be 50% higher this year. He said the company already has spent heavily on expanding its transport capability, part of some $30 billion in capital expenditures and leases through the third quarter. The heightened transportation investment will likely continue over years to come, he said.  For the fourth quarter, Amazon said it expects net sales of $112 billion to $121 billion. That would mark the company鈥檚 first over $100 billion and follows a third-quarter revenue beat that analysts such as eMarketer鈥檚 Andrew Lipsman did not expect.  鈥淲hile it was clear that the pandemic-driven shift to e-commerce would keep Amazon鈥檚 topline elevated, it surprised by easily surpassing an already high bar,鈥?Lipsman said."

2020/10/28,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc鈥檚 long-awaited launch of its Swedish website on Wednesday was marred by glitches and translation errors, including mistaking the Argentinian flag for Sweden鈥檚.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at a logistics centre in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, April 22, 2020. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File Photo  The website, which offers customers more than 150 million products across 30 categories, had used faulty translation from English to Swedish, allowing offensive words in product descriptions.  The word valdtakt, which means rape in Swedish, is being used on several products instead of raps - the correct Swedish word for a plant.  Some product descriptions use a Swedish word for male genitals, instead of the word for rooster, and a frying pan has been listed as a product for women.  Many users took to Twitter to point out the errors.  ""Your choice of words is a catastrophe for your launch and you need a new director for overseas sales. I assume your shares will plummet in response,"" said here one Twitter user.  Another user pointed out that the cost of a product listed on the Swedish website was higher than one on its German website.  Swedish customers could already shop on Amazon through its websites in other European countries such as Germany, and get their purchases shipped in, but this often meant paying high delivery charges.  鈥淲e want to thank everyone for highlighting these issues and helping us make the changes and improve Amazon.se,鈥?a spokesman said.  鈥淚f anyone spots any issues with product pages, please do use the link on the page to provide feedback and we will make the necessary changes.鈥? Shares of budget DIY and homeware retailer Clas Ohlson, fashion specialist Boozt AB, and e-books seller Storytel fell between 2% and 5% on Amazon鈥檚 entry.  The new website will also offer tens of thousands of products from Swedish businesses, said Alex Ootes, vice president for EU Expansion at Amazon.  Orders over 229 crowns and shipping from Amazon鈥檚 distribution centre would be delivered free of charge, the company said.  Most deliveries would be made by postal company Postnord and shoppers will also have the option of priority shipping, with packages delivered within two days.

2020/10/28,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O on Thursday will announce its latest financial results, and Wall Street wants to know if it can keep up with shoppers' heightened demand during the coronavirus pandemic.  FILE PHOTO: Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo  Just three months ago, the world鈥檚 largest online retailer posted the biggest profit in its 26-year history. Governments鈥?stay-at-home orders prompted consumers to shift purchases to web marketplaces such as Amazon, while brick-and-mortar rivals shuttered shops.  Amazon has reaped rewards from this but not without challenges. For a time, Amazon limited its warehousing services to essential goods. The company re-fashioned operations for COVID-19 precautions, though more than 19,000 workers caught the virus - and some demanded site closures. Customers experienced slower-than-usual deliveries.  Some analysts, including Colin Sebastian of Baird Equity Research, want to know if Amazon can manage such challenges while demand climbs with fourth-quarter holiday shopping. The company typically addresses such questions during an analyst call after its financial report.  鈥淒o they have the logistics and delivery capacity to handle order volumes?鈥?Sebastian asked.  Michael Pachter, of Wedbush Securities, cited anecdotes about recent warehousing constraints for certain larger items. 鈥淚 think you鈥檙e going to have a disastrous fourth quarter in terms of demand overwhelming them once again,鈥?he said.  Amazon has long worked to avoid a repeat of the 2013 season when delays left some without gifts on Christmas Day. The company now handles more deliveries in house, and this year it moved its marketing event Prime Day - usually in July - to October, letting shoppers place holiday orders early.  Pachter said, 鈥淭hey wanted us to start thinking 鈥榟oliday鈥?now, before the crazy rush that begins Black Friday.鈥? The extra weeks of shopping may translate into additional sales, with higher-income households offsetting those with depressed budgets for holiday spending.  Analysts on average expect revenue of $92.7 billion for the just-ended third quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
2020/10/28,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union鈥檚 plan to rein in U.S. tech giants with new rules could cost the 27-country bloc as much as 85 billion euros ($100.5 billion) in economic growth, Brussels-based think tank ECIPE warned.  FILE PHOTO: The logos of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in a combination photo from Reuters files./File Photo  Under the proposed rules, Facebook FB.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O unit Google, Amazon AMZN.O and Apple AAPL.O could be forced to share data and banned from favouring their own services.  In a study sponsored by Google, due to be published this week and seen by Reuters, the European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE) said changing the regulatory approach could have a chilling effect on the EU economy.  鈥淭he economic impacts of shifting from ex-post to ex-ante in the online services sector as stipulated by the proposals of the Digital Services Act is to a loss of about 85 billion euros in gross domestic product and 101 billion euros in lost consumer welfare based on a baseline value of 2018,鈥?the think tank said.  鈥淎lso, it will reduce the labour force by 0.9%.鈥?The figure of 85 billion euros is equivalent to 0.5% of the bloc鈥檚 GDP.  ECIPE said it looked into ex ante regulations of general-purpose technology, in particular the telecoms industry, and then replicated the results for online platforms to come up with the figures.  The study cited the risks of ex ante regulations where companies are told what to do before any competitive harm or market failure is proven.  鈥淓x ante approaches are poorly fitted for sectors that are rapidly evolving or to regulate low-risk general-purpose technologies,鈥?it said.  ECIPE said the EU legislative framework was not designed for rapid adjustments of rules nor was it clear what market failures the bloc wants to address with new rules or that these could not be resolved once harm is proven.  The European Commission will publish the rules on Dec. 2, after which it will need to be reconciled with proposals from EU countries and the European Parliament before they become legislation."
2020/10/28,"MILAN (Reuters) - Amazon is set to secure exclusive rights to screen top European Champions League matches in Italy for the 2021-2024 seasons, three sources close to matter said, in what would be its first foray into broadcasting sports events in the country.

REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File Photo  UEFA last month invited broadcasters to submit bids for the rights to screen Europe鈥檚 premier soccer competition in Italy, in one of the biggest broadcasting rights sales in the European soccer industry after the outbreak of the coronavirus this year.  Amazon is nearing exclusive rights to broadcast Wednesday鈥檚 Champions League matches on its streaming platform Prime Video in Italy for some 80-90 million euros, the sources said, in a move seen as a way to boost its Prime subscription service.  Italy鈥檚 top pay-TV broadcaster SKY, owned by U.S. Comcast鈥檚 is nearing a deal to buy most of Champions League matches and Europa League matches, the sources said.  SKY鈥檚 bid was worth about 100-110 million euros per season, two sources said.  Italy鈥檚 top commercial broadcaster Mediaset is close to winning non-exclusive rights for top Champions League matches to be played on Tuesdays for some 45-50 million euros, the sources added.  Final sale results of the deal are expected to be announced by the end of this week, the sources said.  One source said a separate tender to sell Europa League streaming rights might be held in January, as SKY was unable to buy those rights due to an Italian antitrust ruling preventing the pay-TV from securing exclusive contents for its video-streaming platform.  In 2017 SKY bought exclusive rights to broadcast Champions League and Europe soccer matches in Italy for an estimated 270 million euros per season.  SKY and Amazon declined to comment. Mediaset said it was still waiting for the rights to be awarded."
2020/10/26,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India鈥檚 Future Retail Ltd (FRL) will go into liquidation if its deal to sell assets to Reliance Industries fails, the group told a Singapore arbitrator while arguing against Amazon.com Inc鈥檚 bid to scupper the deal, a legal order seen by Reuters showed.  A shipment moves on a conveyor belt at an Amazon Fulfillment Centre on the outskirts of Bengaluru, September 18, 2018. REUTERS/Abhishek N. Chinnappa/File Photo  Amazon on Sunday won an injunction from a Singapore arbitrator to halt FRL鈥檚 deal to sell assets to Reliance. Amazon alleged FRL had breached certain contract provisions it entered into last year in a separate deal with the U.S. firm.  The dispute centres around FRL鈥檚 decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.  Amazon argues that a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group couldn鈥檛 sell its retail assets to anyone on a 鈥渞estricted persons鈥?list including any firms from Reliance chief Mukesh Ambani鈥檚 group. The deal specified any disputes would be arbitrated under Singapore International Arbitration Centre rules.  Shares in Reliance and FRL fell on Monday. Both companies reacted to the arbitrator鈥檚 decision by saying they want to complete the deal 鈥渨ithout any delay鈥? setting the stage for a showdown between Reliance and Amazon - each led by one of the world鈥檚 richest men.  A 130-page order by the arbitrator reveals how Jeff Bezos-led Amazon argued that Future breached agreements which barred it from selling retail assets to entities including Reliance, whose boss Ambani is Asia鈥檚 richest man. It also shows the level of concern at Future if the deal breaks.  Future鈥檚 retail unit - which has more than 1,500 outlets - will need to pack up if the transaction with Reliance doesn鈥檛 go through, hitting the livelihoods of thousands of employees and workers at its vendor firms, the Indian group argued before the arbitrator, according to the order which is not public.  LEGAL OBLIGATIONS  鈥淚f the disputed transaction falls through, FRL will go into liquidation. That will mean that the livelihoods of more than 29,000 employees of FRL will be lost,鈥?the Indian group鈥檚 representatives told the arbitrator V.K. Rajah, a former attorney general of Singapore.  The COVID-19 pandemic has hit many Indian businesses, especially in the retail sector, and the FRL-Reliance deal was aimed at protecting the interests of all stakeholders through a large infusion of funds and the acquisition of liabilities, Future argued at the tribunal.  But Rajah ruled that 鈥渆conomic hardship alone is not a legal ground for disregarding legal obligations鈥?  Amazon, FRL and Reliance didn鈥檛 respond to a request for comment.  Amazon welcomed the arbitrator鈥檚 decision in a previous statement. FRL has said it would take appropriate steps to ensure its deal proceeds unhindered, while Reliance said it will complete the transaction.  Amazon, which counts India as a key growth market where it has invested $6.5 billion, has already been bogged down by antitrust probes and strict foreign investment rules.  The latest tussle puts Amazon at odds not just with FRL but also Ambani and his Reliance group which is fast expanding its e-commerce business, and threatening the dominance of Amazon and Walmart鈥檚 Flipkart in that space.  Two sources familiar with the matter said the injunction was not automatically enforceable in India and that the order would have to be ratified by an Indian court.  Any subsequent legal order in India to halt the deal would allow Amazon to negotiate with Reliance, Future and banks on the other side, said Murali Neelakantan, a corporate lawyer at Indian law firm Amicus which is not involved in the case.  鈥淚f Amazon doesn鈥檛 get an injunction against the deal proceeding in India, they will probably just get damages even if they win the final arbitration,鈥?Neelakantan said."
2020/10/23,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Representatives of Amazon.com Inc in India have refused to appear before a parliamentary panel reviewing the country鈥檚 privacy bill, an Indian lawmaker said on Friday, an allegation the U.S. commerce giant said was a result of a misunderstanding.

Separately, Facebook representatives appeared before the committee on Friday. Twitter has been asked to appear on Oct. 28, while digital payments firm Paytm and Alphabet Inc鈥檚 Google are due to appear on Oct. 29, said another lawmaker who is on the panel but did not wish to be named.  The lawmaker added that if a company鈥檚 executive does not appear before it when asked, it could amount to breach of parliamentary privilege which can even attract a jail term.

Monterrey and Guadalajara are the two biggest metropolitan zones of the country after the sprawling Mexico City area.

Amazon in total now runs five fulfillment centers, two support buildings and two classification centers in Mexico, where it launched its marketplace in 2015.  Enrique Alfaro, the governor of Jalisco state that is home to Guadalajara, said the new local warehouse would help more small and medium sized businesses ship their products faster and at lower costs.  Amazon is also striving to make inroads in Brazil, where it recently opened its fifth and biggest fulfillment center in the country, with 100,000 square meters (1,076,391 sq ft).

The partnership would allow Microsoft to connect its Azure cloud computing platform to SpaceX's network of low-Earth orbiting satellites, offering the software company an edge in its battle with the rival cloud platform from Jeff Bezos' Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  Cloud companies have seen a surge in demand this year as more businesses use their services for switching to work from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Microsoft in recent months has tested its Azure cloud with satellites in space, and in September unveiled its Azure Space venture, tapping into the demand for data-heavy space services.

2020/10/20,"(Reuters) - Walmart Inc is aggressively expanding its advertising business after years of stuttering progress, even as a proposed deal to buy a stake in video-sharing app TikTok remains stuck in limbo.  FILE PHOTO: A shopper is seen wearing a mask while shopping at a Walmart store in Bradford, Pennsylvania, U.S. July 20, 2020. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid  The world鈥檚 largest retailer is making better use of its wealth of shopper data to link promotions on its website and app with ads inside its network of 4,700 U.S. stores, according to Reuters interviews with six advertising agencies and Walmart ad tech partners, three major brands plus bankers and ex-employees.  The refocused strategy was born early last year when Walmart cut ties with its external advertising partner and took the business in-house, calling it Walmart Media Group.  The company bet it could do a better job of bridging online and offline data for its advertisers and give itself a shot at developing an ad platform that could take on Amazon.com Inc, the sources said.  The shift has been paying off, according to one source briefed on the company鈥檚 plans who said Walmart Media Group was on track to earn nearly $1 billion of advertising sales this year, more than double the amount it brought in last year.  Walmart declined to comment on the sales estimate, but it explained its approach to the ad business. 鈥淥ne thing we do at Walmart Media Group is make sure that the advertising we鈥檙e placing is additive to the customer experience, that we鈥檙e not just throwing ads on anything anywhere, that we鈥檙e really strategic,鈥?Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said.  The big challenge now, according to the source, is figuring out how it can continue to expand the ad business into one that will matter to investors for a company that earned about $524 billion in total revenue in fiscal year 2020.  鈥淚t鈥檚 going well, and they want it to go very, very well,鈥?the source said. 鈥淭here have been very material gains but it doesn鈥檛 yet put a dent in Amazon鈥檚 lead or Walmart鈥檚 top or bottom line.鈥? A deal for TikTok, which reaches 100 million U.S. users a month, was supposed to supercharge the strategy by helping Walmart鈥檚 ad machine engage with younger audiences that may not shop regularly at Walmart. But the talks to invest in the Chinese-owned TikTok remain shrouded in political uncertainty.  That, however, has not stopped Walmart from moving ahead with its strategy, the advertising agencies and brands said.  Yet it鈥檚 early days in the drive for Walmart, which has historically struggled to create new lines of business and has never turned a profit form its e-commerce business. Some advertisers and ad agencies said the retailer still had a distance to go on the technology front, including tracking how ads translated into sales - a key selling point for brands.  Walmart faces a huge task chasing Amazon, which is expected to generate about $13 billion in ads this year according to eMarketer, while it is also battling smaller rivals including Target and Kroger which are building their own ad platforms.  Another challenge it must overcome: Walmart disclosed this month that Stefanie Jay, leader of Walmart Media Group, will leave the company for a 鈥渘ew opportunity.鈥?Rich Lehrfeld, Walmart鈥檚 former interim chief marketing officer, will now lead Walmart Media Group.  鈥楢LWAYS IN, ALWAYS ON鈥? In meetings with brands and advertising technology partners, Walmart鈥檚 executives have summed up its goals with a tagline - 鈥淎lways In, Always On鈥?- a reference to how its store network will help advertisers reach more customers, Walmart told Reuters.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  鈥淲hether it鈥檚 online or in the shopping aisle on a screen in the grocery section, they want that brand message through the whole ecosystem,鈥?said Nich Weinheimer, general manager of e-commerce at ad tech firm Kenshoo, which works with Walmart.  Walmart has used its data to improve targeting of ads and convinced some advertisers to sign long-term advertising contracts, brands and former employees say. The company told Reuters that its deals, which include store and digital ads, are typically worth low double-digit millions of dollars.  Dan Cooke, head of e-commerce at jam-maker JM Smucker Co which places ads with Walmart, told Reuters that the retailer had gathered better data on consumers and their purchases this year.  Walmart has uses the data to improve its online display advertising, give clients a better idea of how their ads are performing and provide 鈥渃ritical鈥?online tools that makes it easier for them to monitor and control campaigns themselves, he added.  鈥淭here鈥檚 a bit of an arms race that鈥檚 going on - Amazon has certainly been a trailblazer,鈥?said Cooke, adding that Walmart was responding 鈥渧ery aggressively.鈥? KNOWING WHAT SELLS  Walmart executives view the advertising drive as significant to the success of the retailer鈥檚 e-commerce business as a whole, according to the source briefed on the company鈥檚 plans.  Nearly 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart, according to the retailer鈥檚 website. This is a strength that Walmart needs to leverage more, according to the ad agencies and brands, as it has an insight into consumers鈥?shopping habits.  Walmart鈥檚 stores and Walmart.com together count about 160 million visitors a week, data from investment bank Cowen shows.  Walmart鈥檚 advertising strategy has nonetheless been somewhat hit or miss over the decades.  The retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, dabbled with the advertising business in the late 1990s and early 2000s with an in-store TV network that aired commercials. It expanded the business about 15 years ago to include its website through Triad Retail Media.  The retailer cut ties with Triad in February 2019 and brought all ad operations in-house under Walmart Media Group.  鈥楪LITCHES鈥?COMPLAINTS  The company still faces a series of challenges.  It needs to improve ad-measuring capabilities to show exactly how certain ads lead to specific sales, Smucker鈥檚 Cooke said.  Some advertisers have also complained about 鈥済litches鈥?where ads occasionally disappear from Walmart.com or don鈥檛 show up at all. Kimberly Williams, a former campaign manager at Walmart Media Group, said this happened 鈥渁ll the time鈥? recalling an ad for Mars Inc鈥檚 M&M candies that disappeared for several hours.  According to brands, this happens from time to time on other retailers鈥?platforms as well. Walmart declined to comment.  Longer term, the challenge for Walmart is to figure out an overarching media content strategy to keep customers engaged for longer periods, according to the industry players interviewed.  Walmart considered launching a subscription video service in 2018 but decided against it, according to sources. In other forays, it invested $250 million in a joint venture to develop interactive content and struck a deal with 鈥淛ames Bond鈥?studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer to create content for the Vudu video-on-demand service, which it sold last April.  Walmart is also going after a new channel of ad revenue called 鈥渂rand advertising,鈥?typically reserved for TV, by offering more formats like online display ads, said George Manas, chief media officer at ad agency OMD USA.  Executives hope successful advertising relationships could help it secure promotional tie-ins with the Walmart+ subscription service, its version of Amazon Prime.  Losing the TikTok deal won鈥檛 be a disaster, but landing it would help Walmart flesh out a competitive media strategy, said Mark Boidman, managing director and head of media and tech services at PJ Solomon, which advises Walmart.  鈥淎mazon surrounds the consumer in a 360-degree manner,鈥?Boidman said, referring to Amazon Prime and the free video-streaming service that comes with it.  Walmart is still 鈥済etting there.鈥? (This story adds dropped word 鈥渇ormer鈥?in paragraph 13)"

In September, a research paper from the Open Markets Institute, a Washington-based research and advocacy group, also said Amazon relies on extensive worker surveillance to boost employee output and potentially limit unionization efforts around the United States. reut.rs/31bhOP2  The letter from the lawmakers on Thursday referred to several media articles that have reported similar action by the retailer.  This month, Amazon said more than 19,000 of its U.S. front-line workers contracted the novel coronavirus this year, or 1.44% of the total, a disclosure sought by labor advocates who have criticized Amazon鈥檚 response to the pandemic.  An Amazon spokeswoman said the company respects its employees right to join or form a labor union without fear of retaliation, intimidation or harassment.  On the issue of monitoring, the spokeswoman said Amazon discovered one group within its delivery team that was aggregating information but the practice is against company standards and the team is no longer doing so.  Reuters reported in May that Amazon has long resisted unionization. Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said at the time that Amazon already offers what labor groups are requesting."

EU regulators adopted a similar tactic against Alphabet Inc鈥檚 Google by first addressing complaints about its price comparison shopping service and then opening investigations into other areas of its business.  The European Commission started an investigation into Amazon in July 2019, focusing on whether its dual role as a marketplace for merchants and also as a competitor selling the same products might give it an unfair advantage.  The investigation is also looking at the role of data in the selection of Amazon鈥檚 鈥淏uy Box鈥?winners which appear on the right of product pages saying 鈥淏uy now鈥?or 鈥淎dd to basket鈥?and drive about 80% of sales.

The event, typically held in July to boost summer sales, is now a kickoff to what will be an earlier holiday shopping season. The member-only discounts are a key way Amazon markets Prime, a fast-shipping and media-streaming service that incentivizes subscribers to do more shopping on Amazon.  Rivals Walmart Inc and Target Corp are meanwhile hosting promotions at the same time. Online sales may prove critical for retailers as the pandemic forestalls the typical crowds at stores after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.

Even so, analysts say Amazon faces an uphill battle in Latin America鈥檚 top two economies, where success or failure will set the bar for whether it can take on the rest of the region.  鈥淎mazon in Latin America is not the monster that it is in the United States,鈥?said Marcos Pueyrredon, president of Buenos Aires-based eCommerce Institute.  Amazon does not release country-specific sales data, yet website traffic statistics suggest Amazon is struggling to keep up with Argentina鈥檚 MercadoLibre.  In Mexico, where Amazon launched its marketplace in 2015, it trailed second behind MercadoLibre for most unique visitors in August, according to the media analytics firm ComScore.  In Brazil, a more fragmented market that Amazon joined in 2017, it sat in fifth place after MercadoLibre and local e-commerce powerhouses like B2W, Via Varejo and Magazine Luiza.  Gloria Canales, head of marketing for Amazon in Mexico, said the company has been pleased with growth there, and will keep investing.  鈥淲e strive everyday to add selection, to improve shipping rates, to improve our payment methods. We鈥檙e confident that that鈥檚 what makes us successful.鈥? It is not like Amazon, which in July posted the biggest profit in its 26-year history, cannot afford to play the long game.  Prime, which in Mexico charges users 99 pesos ($4.67) a month or 899 pesos ($42.38) a year and offers a slew of music, games and original television along with free shipping, 鈥渉as been one of the biggest engines of growth that we鈥檝e had in the country,鈥?she said.  Just in time for Prime Day, Amazon recently opened its first so-called fulfillment centers outside the Mexico City area, one in Guadalajara and another in Monterrey.  These massive warehouses boasting inventories of key products will help to speed up shipping to more regions.  In Brazil, where Prime costs 9.90 reais ($1.79) a month or 89 reais ($16.09) a year, Amazon began offering memberships just a year ago. Since then, it has seen the fastest subscription growth of any Prime market, with members now in 95% of municipalities, Amazon said in a statement.  Yet, Prime alone may not be enough to boost Amazon鈥檚 fortunes, said Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures, pointing out inventory and distribution as two key areas where Amazon needs to improve.  鈥淯ndoubtedly it鈥檚 growing,鈥?he said of the Prime program. 鈥淏ut it鈥檚 not a question about growing, it鈥檚 about trying to keep pace with MercadoLibre.鈥? That can be a challenge despite the fact that the local champion lacks a membership perks program on par with Prime. Adding to MercadoLibre鈥檚 headstart since its 1999 founding, the company has a broad base of sellers and understands the local terrain.  Lyana Kahn, founder of Mexican jewelry company LuckyLy, said her sales on Amazon have benefited from Prime鈥檚 shipping and discount perks for customers.  鈥淚t鈥檚 a great platform that gives you the push to reach more customers without a huge investment,鈥?Kahn said.

These are the inquiries that are underway:  Justice Department on Google: The U.S. Justice Department is expected to file a relatively narrow complaint within two weeks, which accuses Google of seeking to disadvantage rivals in search and in lucrative search advertising.  Justice Department on Apple: This probe, which was revealed in June 2019, appears to focus on Apple鈥檚 app store. Some app developers have accused Apple of introducing new products and then pushing out apps which compete with them. Apple says it seeks to have only the highest quality apps in the app store.  Justice Department on Facebook and Amazon: In July 2019, the Justice Department said that it was expanding its Big Tech probes to include 鈥渟earch, social media, and some retail services online鈥?-- an apparent reference to Facebook and Amazon as well.  Federal Trade Commission on Facebook: FTC officials probing Facebook have asked about past acquisitions, like Instagram and WhatsApp, and how Facebook treats app developers on its platform. The FTC told Facebook in June 2019 it was probing whether the company has engaged in unlawful monopolistic practices.  Federal Trade Commission on Amazon: In its probe of Amazon, the FTC is likely looking at the inherent conflict of interest of Amazon competing with small sellers on its marketplace platform, including allegations that it used information from sellers on its platform to decide what products it would introduce.  State attorneys probe Google: A group of state attorneys general led by Texas is expected to file a lawsuit focused on digital advertising, while a group led by Colorado is contemplating a more expansive lawsuit against Google that may also include concerns about its Android business.
